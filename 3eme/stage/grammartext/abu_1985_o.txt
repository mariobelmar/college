thanks for putting up with my periodic moodiness and impatience that

resulted from moments of mental stress that sometimes occurred during

their brief stay with me in Canberra.

        All those mentioned, and some of those not mentioned specifically

                                  ABSTRACT



        The aim of this thesis is to describe sociolinguistic aspects of

Abu'    Arapesh,   a Papuan language spoken by about 5,700 speakers who

live in the central Sepik area of Papua New Guinea. It is the first of

its kind on this community.

        In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a

more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as

seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2.          This and Chapter

ʒ,   which gives    an over sew of the   grammar   and   phonology    of   Abu' ,

provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language

as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu'              in

chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing

the relatively influential     role it has on   the determination of noun

classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's

speech repertoire.      This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour

among    different social   groups.   In chapter   6,    non-verbal   means of

communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7

examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .

                               INTRODUCTION:THE SETTING



        Abu'    is a Papuan language spoken in the mid-central Sepik region

of Papua New Guinea — see map 1 .                 Its speakers number approximately

5»700    according     to   the   census    of    1980.      They   live    in nine major

villages with a number of hamlets clustered around them. The names of

the main villages are Balup, Malin, Aspeis, Welihika, Wolum, Womsis,

Amom,    Womsak No.1     and Womsak No.2. The             first six villages mentioned

belong to the West Sepik Province. They are administered from Vanimo

(the provincial headquarters') via               the    ɪʌvstrieʌ          headquarters at

Aitape.        The last three villages belong to the East Sepik Province and

are administered       from Maprik,        one of      the main     centres of      the same

province.        The area stretches from about 142°43'E to about 143°5'E and

from     approximately      5°23'S   to    5°28'S      covering     roughly    300    square

kilometres of mountainous land. Being landlocked, the Abu' share their

northern border with the Suain,             their western border with the Aruek,

their south-west border with the Miye 'also known as Warn), and their

southern border with Muhiang (variably known as Southern or Ilahita

Arapesh), and Weri'         (also known as Burabita") and finally their eastern

border with the Buki (also known                 as Mountain Arapesh').            The Suain

speak     the     Ulau-Suain      Austronesian         language.     The    rest     of   the

communities speak non-Austronesian or Papuan languages which belong to

the Kombio stock of the Torricelli Language phylum (Laycock,                         1973 and

1975).

1.1 Historical Background

      It is not known how long the Abu'             have been in       their present

position or how and where they originated. However, oral traditions of

the Womsis and Wolum clans of Womsis village suggest they came from

the south or southwest, although the Subak clan of the same' village

disagreed. The members of this clan claim that they originated from a

place not far inland from Lelap or Suain No.                 2,    shown on map 2.

Warfare and inter- and        intra-ethnic marriages were claimed as being

the main social factors causing migrations of people who make up the

Womsis and Wolum population.       If so, these movements would seem to be

part of a general movement of Arapesh speakers,               who,     it is claimed

(Laycock 1969; and Tuzin 1973'', were being pushed into the Alexander                        .

and Torricelli mountains by the Boiken and Abelam probably many years

prior to European contact in the 1370s.                                              ,

      At- about this   time    the Germans were claiming that part of New

Guinea and officially annexed it in 1384. However, before the Germans

there were Malays. Literature on colonial contact in the Aitape (spelt

Eitape in German records) district^ makes direct or indirect reference

to   the presence of Malays and Germans          in the Sepik region. However,

there is no direct mention of their presence in the Abu' area.                 Evidence

for their presence in Womsis and other Abu' villages comes mainly from oral

accounts obtained from Abu'       and a few Miye elders,           none of whom had

firsthand knowledge of the two groups of outsiders.

      A   widely-held view     among    Womsis     oral   historians    is    that   the

Malays (variably known to the Abu'          as koukou (probably intended for

Chinese   from   Hong Kong),    Malai    'Malay'     or   Parani     a word    derived




     Aspects of this oral history are treated more fully in Nekitel,
1975-
  2Cf.e.g., Parkinson 1900, McCarthy 1956, Peter Sack and Damphne
Clark eds., 1980; Townsend, 1968; Seiler, 1983; Allen, 1976 and
Swadling 1979«
                                                                                                      5


probably from the Bahasa Malaysian word parang^                            'cleaver,        chopper',

were   in the        area before       the arrival of Germans.              These Malays were

involved in the bird-of-paradise plume trade.

       Although informants claimed that the Malays were once widespread

in the Abu'          area and       further inland,         available literature on early

contact    with the          area provides         no direct      confirmation of           the oral

accounts.      The only direct mention of the presence of Malays in the

coastal village of Suain (with whom the Abu' share a common geographic

and    linguistic       border)       has    been    made    by   Bryant       Allen     (1976)     and

Frances     Deklin      (1979)-       In    these    accounts     we     find    (p.58      and    p.51

respectively''        that    the    Malays,       after    establishing trading            bases at

Yakamul, Ulau and Suain penetrated the Torricelli mountains in search

of bird-of-paradise plumes.                  Allen noted in passing that                 the Malays

followed the "Danop" (probably intended for Mabam/Danmap) River to get

to the interior. The route along the Danmap is more cowMenient                               than the

mountain ones for people to travel to the Abu’                         country         and further

inland.        It would seem likely that                 the Malays and Germans had been

visiting       the    Abu'     villages       by     following     the     Danmap      up     to    the

Torricelli divide as suggested by the Womsis oral historians.

       Contact between Malay plume traders and the Abu' appears to have

been slight however. The only form of contact between them appears to

have been when Malay overseers recruited Abu' and Warn men to help hunt

down birds-of-paradise. The plumes of the captured birds were wrapped

in bundles of 'dark palm sheaths' (Tok Pisin limburn1 and were taken to

the coast      (presumably to55 the abdvementioned                    bases)    from     where they
                                                     i
were shipped away to buyers'for the international market.

       There     is    nothing       of     significance       left    behind     which       can    be

attributed to the Malays'                 language and culture. The only relics left

behind are a few Malay words that have become part of the Abu'                   Tok

Pisin     vocabulary.       Words   such   as    (Tok   Pisin)     binatang(<Bahasa

Malaysian word binatang 'animal, creature'4 'bug, insect, gnat' sayor

(<Bahasa Malay sayur)       'vegetable'    and klambu 'mosquito net'-       and the

Abu'    vernacular word for 'master or European'        duak (pl.      duasimi) are

derived from Malay. Duak is a probable derivative from the Malay word

tuan,    'master'   or   'European'. So'eh,     the word used in Abu'       for 'raw

tobacco', is another probable reflex of the Malay word sake.                However,

because binatang, sayor and klambu are common Tok Pisin (formerly New

Guinea     Pidgin   or   Neo-Melanesian)      vocabulary   items     they   probably

entered Abu' via Tok Pisin.

        The German presence in the Abu' area was brief and marginal.             One

of the Womsis elders (aged about 70 in 1980, died in 1984) summarized

the presence of the Germans in the Abu’ area in Tok Pisin as follows:


           "01 Siaman i kam raun tupela taim tasol.  Na i kam sindaun
       long Morifibi em pies klostu long Wolum. 01 i kalabusim Wakufa
       kisim i stap inap long taim ol i bringiɪn Uwasim orait ol i
       lusim Wakufa i kam na ol i kisim Uwasim -em papa bilong mipela
       i go long plantesin long Rabaul wantem Nakimo' . Mi i no lukim
       ol Siaman, mi harim ol papa i tokim mi.




          The Germans made two trips to the Abu' area and sojourned
       at Morifibi near Wolum.    They captured Wakufa and kept him
       until they brought Uwasim to them. Wakufa was then released.
       Uwasim and Nakimo' ( the author's mother's uncle) were taken ,
       to work on a plantation in Rabaul. I did not see the Germans,
       but only heard my fathers tell about them.


        Unfortunately,    this view receives no direct support from written

sources either. However, indirect support for the view occurs in Jinks

et al.     (l973:240).   Thus it was reported therein that            "by 1914 the

                                                                                                5


number of labourers increased from 17,500 to 31,000 in 1921" and that

"Aitape, Madang and Kieta" were the main areas from which most of the

labour force was recruited and Rabaul and Kavieng became the centres

in which most of the "labour force was concentrated". The two ʌbu' men

alluded to in the oral account quoted above were probably among the

group of labourers referred to.

       Allen     (1976:57-59)        showed    that       between    1905     and    1920   "four

Chinese— Ah Long and three others known to the villagers ɛof ʊratɜ as

Kasing,       Tulhoi and Nihing — were recruiting in the Drekikir area".

He also noted (p.62) that a "German visited Warn village" around about

the same time.       It would seem more likely that Womsis, being closer to

the    coast    than Warn     is,    could    have    been      visited     probably     by more

Germans       than   the    fex<    remembered       by   the    Womsis     oral    historians.

However,       on the whole, the Germans were reluctant to proceed beyond

areas yet to be brought under administrative control at that time. The

Germans were, in our informants'                 phraseology,       "gotten rid of by the

Inkilis"       'English'.      The Abu'       use the       term    Inkilis    to refer     to a

collection of post-German English-speaking (i.e.                       Australian) colonial

administrations such as:


      - a) the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionery Force
        that administered the Trust Territory of New Guinea from
        1914 to 1921 ,

      - b) the civilian administration which took over from military
        occupation force under the League of Nations from 1921 right
        to the time of the outbreak of the Pacific or the Second
        World War in 1941 and

      - c) the Australia New Guinea Administrative Unit (A.N.G.A.U.,
        cf. e.g., W.J.Hudson 1971, ed. and B.Jinks 1973» ®t al.).

        The     Inkilis     (especially       the     Australian      Naval        and   Military

Expeditionery Force and the civilian Administration'* were acknowledged

and credited by the Abu' with introducing a number of sociopolitical

changes among the Abu'.               German     influence in        this regard         was nil.

Although the Germans left behind a history of the introduction of a
                                                                                                             6


socio-economic          and        political     system       that        became        the      model     for

subsequent colonial administrations, their efforts in this regard were

concentrated in the coastal villages and only marginally so inland.

       One     of     the    major     changes     made       in     the        late     1920s,     by     the

Australian       administration,          was     the   appointment             of     'village chiefs'

(Tok    Pisin luluai)          and     their    assistants (Tok Pisin tultul).                            Once

appointed,      these men became the intermediaries between the villagers

and     the    colonial         administration          which        exercised             its    political

influence      from Aitape, a one-time district headquarters of the Sepik

region (cf. e.g., Rowley 1958:36).

        Another main structural change was the creation of post-contact

communal camps.             Dispersed clans were encouraged,                      or coerced        in some

cases, to live together in these camps for the convenience of colonial

officials.           Haus kiap,        the Tok Pisin word for 'government official

rest houses' were built in these camps.                        From then on,               the camps and

the    ha us   kiap     functioned       and     still do,           as    symbols         of    inter-clan

sociopolitical unity.                Members of different clans went and even still

go, to these communal camps whenever they had/have important meetings,

or    whenever       they put        on major     inter-       and        intra-village          social     or

political functions.

        During the annual official patrols, the kiaps sojourned in these

camps    to    census        people,    settle     disputes,          punish         law    breakers       and

command villagers             to maintain general village hygiene.                            The 'village

chiefs’,       the    'chief        assistants’     and       titi        'medical       man'     or     "heil

tul-tul",(jinks, et al.                1973:138) were checked and replaced if there

was a need to change. On a number of occasions during these patrols,

able young Abu' men were indentured to work for a period of years on

plantations away in the New Guinea islands region and other parts of

what    was then        the Trust       Territory of New Guinea.                       For example,        the

author's       father        was     recruited     by     a    kiap        to    work       on    Makurapau
                                                                                                   7

from 1949-51•

        Other groups of Europeans who got into the ʌbu'                          area, especially

in Womsis and          its surrounds,             were ðhuviɑl       gold prospectors,       called

masta gol in Tok Pisin and land surveyors or cartographers, referred to

in Tok Pisin as masta mak.                   The latter group passed through the area

in 1926 and the former were there in the 1930s (ef.                              Jack K. McCarthy

1935-1936 annual diary reports 1 .

        A number of Abu' men worked as carriers for the land survey team.

A few were employed as domestic servants or huntsmen for the masta

gol.     Apart from a few Welihika men who were employed to dredge gold

in the Atob and Mindil rivers (map 2 ), most of the labourers employed

there     according         to     oral     accounts,       were     recruited    from    different

coastal       areas such         as Vanino,        Wewak,    Madang,     and   the    inland Sepik

River basin.

        In 1936, kiap Makati (Administrative officer Jack K. McCarthy),

who was stationed at Aitape then,                        reported in his annual report that

he     went   to     the    area    to     investigate       a   complaint     from   some   of the

labourers       in    Womsis        and    Welihika        gold-fields    (McCarthy       1935-1936

annual report). A couple of the employees'                          spokesmen walked to Aitape

and laid a charge against their employers, namely Bell and Johnston,for

maltreatment.              The     two    (most     probably       Australian)     overseers    were

stationed at Welihika r,nd Womsis at that time. Having been told about

the maltreatment, McCarthy set out at once for Womsis and Welihika to

investigate         the reported .complaint. When he got                   there, both men had

already disappeared from their bases. One went down to the coast, the

other upriver (probably to avoid being interrogated by the kiap).                               This

seems to be the earliest written report that mentions the existence of

what     is   now     the    West        Sepik    Abu'    villages.     Soon     after,   the   land

suveyors      mapped       the     Abu'    territory       and these maps became          a useful
                                                                                                     8


source of information for subsequent patrols                           and during          the Second

World War.

     During      the      Second    World      War,     the    Abu'    people      experienced      the

trauma     and     the      harsh     social          impact       created    by     the     military

bombardment.  The war disturbed the relatively peaceful existence of
                                                              I
the Abu'. Many Abu' people were displaced from their villages.    As

military operations between the ^llied forces and the Japanese troops

intensified in the Abu'              area,      Abu'    people were ordered               to evacuate

their villages and went down to the coast for a brief sojourn at Ulau.

This was to enable the allied forces and Abu' sympathisers to launch a

major assult on the Japanese who had                                         the hinterland from

the coast east of Aitape.

     Many     young       Abu'     men,    including       my      father,    were    enlisted      as

carriers for the Allied forces.                   Others were recruited as guides and

fighters, and were given guns and Viand grenades to fight the Japanese

troops both alongside the Allied                      forces and      on their own, when they

encountered        lone    Japanese       in    the    thick       jungles    of    the    Torricelli

mountains.       After the Japanese were expelled from the area,                             the Abu'

people were told to return to their villages.

     Another very influential                   group of       Europeans were         the Catholic

Missionaries who established themselves at Yakamul and Ulau prior to

the Second World War. Having established themselves there, they began

spreading their influence int<2b*the interior. By about 1938, a number

of Abu' young men were recruited to de catechetical training, first at                                    •*

Yakamul,     and     then    at     St.        Xavier's       on    Kairiru     island,     about    20

kilometres       off the     coast of Wewak (map 4).                     Some      completed    their

training     after two       years,       others,      including my uncle Joseph Ubaim,

were still there when the War                    "reached New Guinea in               1941"    (Downs

1980).     They were, according to Ubaim, evacuated and returned to their

villages. In chapter 2, we will discuss the processes of modernization
                                                                                      9


as a prelude to a more detailed discussion on the Abu'                  language area

and the Abu' dialects.


1.1.1 Previous Work on Arapesh Languages

      According to Laycock (1973), the Arapesh languages form a family

of   closely related       languages.    Taking   them as   a group,     the Arapesh

society has been studied by only a handful of social scientists. The

earliest ethnographic and linguistic studies on the Arapesh were done

by Margaret Mead and Reo Fortune in the 1930s and 1940s. Margaret Mead

popularized the term Arapesh, which denotes 'people'.                  Fortune (1942)

examined    the noun classes of the coastal dialect of Buki and                   as a

result     proposed ʊ      main noun classes.      He adopted     the morphological

shape of the plural suffixes of nouns as bases for determining the

classes proposed.

      In   their study      on the   classification    of   the   languages      spoken

within the Maprik district, Glasgow and Loving (1964) provides us with

a first account of the Arapesh linguistic area. In there,                 the Arapesh

languages of Weri',        Muhiang and    Buki were mapped and referred to as

Bumbita Arapesh, Southern Arapesh, and Mountain Arapesh, respectively.

Laycock (1973) uses the same names, but regards Southern Arapesh and

Mountain    Arapesh   as    distinct    languages,   not    dialects    of   a   single

language. Unfortunately these authors were unaware of the existence of

Abu' Arapesh and thus no mention is made of it in their publications.

      It was about ten years after 1964 that the Abu' speaking villages

were cited in a linguistic study for the first time. In his general

linguistic survey, Laycock (1973), provided an overview of the types

of languages spoken in both the East and the West Sepik Provinces and




  ?When I analysed the Abu' language noun classes in my 1977 Honours
thesis, I adopted (after Fortune) the morphological criteria. However,
upon re-examination it has been found to be not too well founded.
Consequently a review will be made in chapter 4 on the criteria that
trigger the categorisation of nouns in Abu' into different noun
classes.
                                                                                                    10


listed      villages accordingly.             There we     find      that    the   ʌbu'       villages

referred         to above,    were assigned as follows:              Amom, Womsak No. 1            and

Womsak No.2 to Muhiang (southern Arapesh) and all the West Sepik Abu'

villages were assigned to Mountain Arapesh.

       A    little      earlier      on,   Capell     (1969:112,      note)    made       a    passing

remark      to    the   effect      that   Arapesh is      typologically similar                to the

Baining      language of           East New Britain.       Both languages,          like       Chambri

(Pagotto 1976), Olo (MacGregor and MacGregor 1982), and even languages

as far away as the Chinook of Alorth America and the Bantu languages of

the southern half of Africa, possess noun classes and also maintain the

principle of nominal concord.ɛ

       Another scholar who has studied the Arapesh (a Southern Arapesh

group called by him Ilahita Arapesh) is Donald F. Tuzin (1972, 1976).

This       anthropologist          examined    the      "complex      dual     organization         of

formalized         system     of    social    categories       and    conventions         which,    by

virtue       of    their      dynamic      interaction      with      elements      of        kinship,

affinity, and proximity,              provides the key to unity among the Ilahita

Arapesh" (Mead, 1976, foreword in Tuzin 197(0.

       Bernard Narakobi, a Buki speaker, has written about                           the       Arapesh

(especially the Buki) beliefs in gods or spirits (cf. Narakobi 1977).

       At    about      the   same    time, Bob      and Jo    Conrad (n.d.1          provided a

preliminary draft of the morp’nosyntax of Bukiyup (or Bukiyip) , a Buki

dialect. They had also written on this language's sentences (1975) and
                                   *
conducted a general            survey of basic vocabulary of Arapesh languages

(Conrad      and    field-assistants,          1973).    The   author has only                seen the




  ^Edward Sapir, 1921:114-115. tells us that       the essence of the
principle Lof nominal concord] is simply this, that words (elements)
that belong together, particularly if they are syntactic equivalents
or are related in like fashion to another word or element, are
outwardly marked by the same or functionally equivalent affixes.
Concord is always accompanied by sound repetition. The application of
the principle varies considerably according to the genius of the
particular language".

preliminary         draft    of        Bukiyup       morphophonemics,          none        of     the     other

studies being available at the time of writing.

        It is quite obvious that none of the authors of the works cited

was aware of the existence of, and separate identity of what the Miye

(called      Warn   by   Glasgow         and     Loving      1964»       and   Laycock           1973),     the

Muhiang,      Aruek,        Buki       and     the    ʌbu'    themselves            have,       from      'time

immemorial', known as the ʌbu' speech community.                               The identity of this

as a unit or entity separate from those other generally recognized

Arapesh languages will be discussed further in chapter 2.



1.2 Objectives and Methodology of the Thesis


1.2.0.1 Objectives

        Papua New Guinea is experiencing an epoch of irreversible social,

political, economic, cultural and intellectual ʤnɑrrʌsm characteristic.                                     of

many fast developing Third-VJorld countries. Changes, as such, not only

affect      the     traditional          structural          system      of    sociopolitical              and

cultural organizations, which, by virtue of their dynamic interaction

give traditional Papua New Guinea communities a sense of multi-ethnic

richness and diversity,                 but also offer an intellectual challenge to

different         branches         of        traditional       epistemology.                    Traditional

epistemologies of all kind are being challenged, or are at the mercy

of     an   intellectualization               process    whose       "root     is     to    be     found 'in

western scholasticism" (Bernard Narakobi,                          1980).      Our creative myths,

legends, oral histories,                linguistic theories and skills in our native

tongues, as well as a host of other cultural knowledge can no longer

be left intact, unquestioned and                      intellectually unchallenged as they

were in the past.

        Papua New Guinea has, in many respects,                           opted to flow with the

tide    of modernity.         Broadly          speaking,      it     recognizes        the        fact     that

intellectual         change       is    an    inevitability,         a    process      which       enhances
                                                                                                               12


modernity.      In spite of this recognition,                        little effort (cf.Narakobi

1980 and 1985 and Waiko 1985) is made by Papua New Guineans themselves

to draw from their communities'                   rich aspects of their epistemologies

to blend with introduced values of alien epistemologies in order to

effect desirable change.                 Such knowledge, when tapped and incorporated

with western values, should create an interesting and unique nation of

Papua    New    Guinea,         a   country      with    many       aesthetic        values,          material

culture and various forms of knowledge about human life .

        The    present      study     oP    the     social      aspects        of    Abu'        is    heavily

prompted       by     the      concerns       about       researching,            writing         and     thus

preserving          the   various        forms    of     traditional           knowledge          from     the

sociolinguist's point of view. It focusses on the speech community in

which    the author was born.               The aim is          to describe how this speech

community talks about               its language,            and how the community uses its

language       to    talk      about an     endless variety of topics,                      and how this

social use of language binds, or divides different social groups of a

community. As such this study is, at least for Papua New Guinea, unique

in the sense that it provides an opportunity for the outsider uta see,
                                                                 *
from an insider's perspective, a hitherto undescribed knowledge of a

specific       speech community            of one       of    the    world's        multicultural          and

multilingual          nations.       The    reason       why        language        issues       have     been

focussed on is because language-plays a central role in every facet of

cultural       life.      It    permeates        all    aspects       of   human       life       and     is    a

"window" into culture.               Language, as Hymes (1964:5) observed:


          "..., is the simplest and the basic feature    among those
      which make up specifically human activity. Whatever our
      literary and artistic or our philosophical and religious grasp
      of human ways, the scientific understanding of man will in all
      likelihood grow from our understanding of language ..."


        In preparing the following description I have been well aware of

the     fact    that,       being    a     native       speaker      of    Abu'      and     a        part-time

observer-participant of my parents’ society, I have had the advantage
                                                                                                        13


of     being       able    to     analyse         the    data     and    present      an     insider's

perspective. On the other hand.I am aware that I might well be accused

of being subjective and biased in the same analysis. Because of this,

particular attempts have been made to preclude subjective presentation

as    far   as     possible,      except        where     it was       felt necessary       to stress

certain viewpoints. Consequently the description is largely based on

data     obtained         from    other        Abu',     who     were    considered        experts      in

particular areas of culture. Most of these experts unfortunately died

during the period of the fieldwork or soon after.

        Because      the    thrust        of    the     thesis    is    concerned   with        hitherto

undescribed         sociolinguistic aspects                of Abu',      only a     fairly general

treatment of the most general features of ʌbu' grammar will                                be     given.

However,       this does not mean that the grammar of the language is any

less    interesting.         It     is    very     interesting         but a    proper description

would    require too much space.                  The present sketch, however,                  not only

serves      to    give     some   features         of    the grammar       which never pcevioosl'y

described, but it is necessary to acquaint the reader with the general

background knowledge of the language□ This general description of the

grammar      is     also    meant    to        provide    the    linguistic      dimension       to    the

discussions and remarks to be made on the sociolinguistic aspects of

Abu' in chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7.

        The nature and status of ʌbu' vis-a-vis other Arapesh languages,

are     dealt       with     in     chapter        2.    The     chapter       commences        with    an

ethnographic description of Womsis, the location in which most of the

field data was collected.                      It then goes on to examine in more detail

the Abu' language area, providing a summary of Abu' views on why they

regard themselves as a different language group from other genetically

related languages. The Abu'                     language dialects are also discussed                    in

this chapter. On the basis of sociological and linguistic (especially

lexical)         data,    it is established             for the    first time that Abu'               is a

separate language and not a dialect of Buki and Muhiang Arapesh.
                                                                                                        14


       In    chapter      4,    the      Abu'     world-view ‘is            discussed          and.   its

folk-taxonomy treated in an attempt to ascertain the extent to which

these two aspects of                  Abu' knowledge influence the systematization

of the different noun classes. Attempts are also made to specify the

factors      or   determinants          assumed    to     induce      the    Abu'       to    apportion

creatures and things of the world into the different noun classes in

the language.        It is established that, although there is a distinction

between world- view, as.mapped out in the folk-taxonomy presented, and

the semantic basis for categorization of classes, it is demonstrated

that they can be related.

       Chapter 5 examines the speech repertoire on a language-internal

basis.       The numerous speech-, styles of Abu'                 that segment, isolate and

identify      social     groups     within       the    Abu'     community        are    delineated.

Sociocultural contexts that prompt the use of social styles and their

distribution        in    culture       are     specified.       Linguistic         features          that

characterize each of the styles are demonstrated to highlight why the

Abu'   regard these styles to be different, not only from one another,

but how and why the speech styles as a whole differ from 'standard

Abu'' dika ka'is kekehi'i.

       The    social      speech      styles      differ       from   one    another          and     from

standard Abu' in terms of lexicon, "contextualization signals" and the

sociocultural       contexts       in    which     they    are     used     and     distributed         in

society and culture.            Some of the styles were/are unique to the Abu'

Arapesh while others were/are the same as or similar to                                      those used

elsewhere. An understanding of standard Abu' does not necessarily mean

that one can understand the language of different social groups in the

Abu'     society.        As a   matter of fact,            the degree of intelligibility

‘decreases from the normal or standard Abu'                      speech to the more highly

poetic or metaphoric styles used in chants, sung oratory and secretive

talk. These styles determine both the verbal behaviour of speakers and

define the role Abu' members are expected to play in society.
                                                                                                                       15


        Language,       although the primary medium of communication,                                              is not

the    only available           medium.           The    Abu',        because       of    their          geographic

position and for cultural reasons have, from 'time immemorial', used

natural       objects    such        as     plants       to     represent       or       relay messages                in

conventionalized          ways.           Consequently,             chapter    6    examines the speech

surrogates       used    by         the    Abu'.         Although           technologically               not        very

advanced compared with modern telecommunication and graphic devices,

those    surrogates did,              and       some     still       do    have,     clear communicative

functions        similar       to    their modern cou^erparts.                       Their value                   should

therefore be seen in those terms.

        In chapter 7, I examine language attitudes and use. The chapter

commences        with     an        analysis        of        Abu'     metalinguistic               views           about

languages.        This    aspect           of    sociolinguistics              among          the       New        Guinea

language       communities has              been virtually neglected                      by       linguists who

have studied the languages of the area.                               The chapter then goes on to

examine the kinds of languages available for use by the Abu'.                                                      One of

the main concern? is to examine and analyse the social parameters that

'determine          the use of many of the languages.                                The degree to which

neighbouring        languages             (in    which        the    Abu'     have       or    claim           to    have

multilingual skills)                             have affected Abu' are looked at towards

the end of the chapter.

        The    conclusion reached                 in this           chapter    is    that          an    increasing

knowledge of Tok Pisin and its universal use in most speech situations

within and beyond the Abu' frontiers discourages the learning of other

vernacular languages which was until fairly recently (less than twenty

years     ago)    an     important              requirement          for    inter-        and       intra-ethnic

communication.             Therefore,             it     is     predicted          that       if        the    younger

generation of Abu'              parents          neglect        the       teaching of Abu'                    to    their

children,       this language will face a greater risk of reduction and a

real    possibility of              being lost.           This situation             is augmented                   by an
                                                                                                          16


increasing number of Tok Pisin-epeaking Abu' villagers.                                  Hence it is

highly likely that the future trend of the Abu' multilingual scenario

might reduce to a monolingual situation where Tok Pisin will become

the    only    language      of    any    serious          dicussion    or    conversation.          This

trend, according to numerous oral accounts, is demographically gaining

momentum       in    many    parts       of        Papua     New    Guinea,       especially         among

children.


1.2.0.2 Descriptive Approach

       This study is not meant to                     be an    application of a particular

sociolinguistic         model      to     a    language,       nor     is    it    meant      to     be    a

delineation of sociolinguistic theory, using data from Abu'                                     for the

purpose       of    demonstration.            The     work    is    primarily descriptive              and

allusions to certain theoretical issues have been made only where this

seemed        either    to    facilitate            an     understanding          of    the    relevant

sociolinguistic aspects themselves, or where the Abu'                                  data were seen

to be especially relevant and enlightening to those issues.

       In view of the rather broad nature of issues described in this

thesis,       the review of literature and the descriptive                             framework used

for describing sociolinguistic aspects treated in each chapter, are

specified in that chapter. On the whole, the presentation is guided by

the    structuralist         approach         to     linguistic      description.             Language­

internal       paradigms     are    set       up    and    issues    are     discussed        from    an

Abo'     MievJ^oinT-

1.3 Materials


1.3*0.1 The Data

       The    data which     form the   basis for          this thesis        were collected

during two field-trips of a total duration of 15 months. The raw data

collected      from   the    Abu'   instructors         comprise   roughly       20 hours     of

transcribed      texts.       These   were   supplemented          by    field    notes     made

especially when recording was not possible. Previous writings on the

community      were   also     consulted     and       appeal    was    made     to     personal

knowledge as required but a conscious attempt was made not to allow

the latter to prejudice the conclusions reached. The only chapter in

which personal knowledge is important is the chapter on grammar and

phonology.       Being a native speaker, the author simply did not have to

waste tapes and time in recording the necessary data for this.                              This

does not necessarily mean that the description of the ʌbu' grammar is

purely       idiolectal.      Since   certain          aspects   of     the    language     were

described      previously (Nekitel 1977 & 1984) after a number of fellow

native speakers of the language were consulted,                        views of the entire

Abu'   community were        borne in mind      when      the    grammar was          described.

Unless otherwise indicated, the data are drawn from Abu* Womenika, *the

'Upper Abu'' dialect, because it is the one that I speak as my first

language.       Dialect differences will be dealt with in the following

chapter.

       I would like to point out too           that some of the data presented,

especially on certain aspects of non-verbal communication and some of

the    cultural rituals       in chapters          5     and     £>,    disappeared      in the

1950s, or earlier on. Hence some of the issues treated there are from

my recollections, and from information made available by Abu'                            elders.

Virtually all the quotations in the different chapters have been taken

from personally-recorded texts.
                                                                                                 18


1.4 Presentation


1.4.0.1 A Note on Glosses

        When one language is used to write about another,                             writers are

often confronted with the problem of choosing appropriate glosses to

approximate morphemes, words or concepts of the language being written

'about. In this respect, the solution I have arrived at in the glossing

of Abu'       morphemes,        words and        concepts is      often a      compromise.       In

particular each morpheme has been given one gloss unless the morpheme

fulfils more           than    one   grammatical        or    semantic    function.      In    such

instances, appropriate meanings that approximate the range of meanings

of     the    Abu'    morphemes      are    given.       To    prevent    confusion     over    the

singular       or     plural    sense      of   the    Abu'   nouns,     I have   in restricted

circumstances used sg. and pl.                   'singular' and 'plural' to isolate and

maintain semantic distinctions.                   The English glosses are enclosed in

single quotes.

        The    use of        symbols and        abbreviations to         represent repetitious

grammatical categories and words has been adopted to reduce the number

of characters and avoid unnecessary verbage. These are listed below.

Abu'     morphemes       or    words have        been underlined.          Morphemes    of    other

languages such as Tok Pisin have been specified wherever reference is

made to them to avoid possible confusion of them with those of Abu'. A

glossary of the most common Tok Pisin items used in the                                 thesis is

listed        below    for     reference.        The    symbol    [']    has   been   adopted    to

represent the glottal stop in Abu'.

                       THE ABU' LANGUAGE AREA IN MORE DETAIL



2.1 Introduction

       In    this    chapter,    I   describe    the   Abu'    language    area     in   more

detail.      I examine the social and linguistic reasons that prompt the

Abu'     to regard      themselves as different from other Arapesh language

groups.       I     also discuss     the Abu’   dialects towards          the end    of the

chapter.

       First, I want to summarize the post-Second World War processes of

change      experienced     by   the    Abu'.     This   background       information       is

important and must be known if related issues to be discussed in the

following chapters are           to be properly understood.


2.1.1 The Universe of the Field Work

       The field work was based at Womsis. The name Womsis is derived

from Womehis 'ridge dwellers'.             Womsis (l4J°E 3°20'S) is situated on a

narrow river valley at the junction of Midil and Keteh creeks.                           It is

approximately         150   metres     above    sea    level   and   is     about    twenty

kilometres inland from the coast (cf. Australian Army Map, SA 54-16,

Edition 2, Series T5O4) • The Midil and Keteh creeks 'map                         feed into

the Atob, which flows into             the Mabam about six kilometres downstream

from the Midil and Atob junction.               Below the Mabam and          Atob rivers'

junction, the river is called Mabam.              The same river is referred to by

the Suain as Danmap, (Danmap is a compound') the first part of which is

derived from the Ulau-Suain word dan 'water'.

       Administratively,         Womsis is made up of both Womsis             itself and

Wolum,      a hamlet located on the banks of the Mabam, (map 3). Broadly
                                                                                                  22


speaking,        Welihika is also included here because it belongs to the

same political unit that makes up the Womsis council area which is

represented         by a     councillor at          the     Siau   Local   Government        Council

meetings         held,    every     two       months • at Aitape.      Throughout this thesis

Womsis will be used, to refer to both Womsis and. Wolum villages. Womsis

and Welihika,            however,       maintain separate          registries and their total

population in 1980 was approximately 5&0.


2.1.1.1 Why Womsis was chosen as the base

       Womsis       was    chosen       for    a   number    of    reasons.      The    first   was

personal.        Womsis, as my natal home, seemed an obvious choice. To have

one's own village as a base for a university-sponsored empirical data

collection was a rare opportunity.

       Another good reason is that Womsis is the only educational centre

in     the   entire       Abu'    territory.         The    establishment     of       the   Womsis

community        school     by    the     Franciscan       Catholic    Mission     in    1978   has

consolidated Womsis' long tradition of being the educational centre of

the entire Abu' area J

        Students who attend the school often come with their parents. A

number of the parents from Labuain, Aruek, Womsak, Niluk, Amom and Warn

were interviewed when they came to attend                          the Parents and Community

(P&C) Association's work-parades or when they came to look after their
             2
children.

        Although there is no vehicular road built to the West Sepik Abu'

villages,        the building of a small landing strip at Welihika enables




  1Womsis was the first Abu' village to have catechist schools in the
1940s.    This relatively longer exposure to western education has
implications for the relatively higher literacy rate among the Womsis
adult and child    populations (cf.2.1.2.2).
     ^The catchment area for the Womsis community school,                          includes the
Abu' and Aruek villages and children of Womsis and Welihika relatives
from the Muhiang speaking village of Niluk (map ʒ) and some Miye
speakers.
                                                                                         23


the Franciscan Catholic Mission's Cesena 127 to land there (map 3)« It

occasionally flies in the meagre supplies for the locally-owned trade

store and the Catholic Mission and medical personnel. Since it is the

only form of transport available, the choice of a field work base was

made with that in mind.


2.1.1.2 The Abu' people and their characteristics

       Womsis and other Abu'         people are akin to other Arapesh language

speakers (see Mead 1939, Tuzin 1976). They are of a slight build and

are generally of fine physical appearance.                    In principle,      they are

amiable,   genuine and hospitable. Humility, obedience and loyalty are

admired.   Oratory       skills    are   valued    and    disputations     are    normally

settled through consensus. The concept of eommunalisɪn is very central

in Abu' life and has a far-reaching uniting effect.                    It draws people

together   to    share    with     one   another    their    skills,   labour     and   its

rewards.    Communalism should be seen in the context of the ŋraetiee of

reciprocity.    In essence it means that when an Abu'                gives something of

some   value    to   another      ʌbu'   or   to   an    outsider,   the   recipient     is

expected to do the same. Generous hospitality, for example, is offered

with the view that the host will be offered the same when s/he happens

to be the guest.

       Christianity has had an impact on Abu' spiritual life.                    Since the

Catholic Mission went to the area in               the 1930s,    many Abu'       have been

baptized. Womsis is a good example of an Abu' village where almost all

are Catholics. Christianity has therefore                 become an integral part of

the Abu' life.

2.1.2 Non-traditional processes of modernization

       Processes        of    modernization              experienced             by     the       Abu'     will    be

examined       under    five        broad       headings:           education,         health,           transport,

economic and political. These are discussed in detail as follows.


2.1.2.1 Education

       The first non-traditional form of education the Abu' were exposed

to was religious instruction. This was introduced by the Society of

the    Divine    Word        (SVD).         The    parish priest                of Ulau,          Father Edmund

Kunisch, who         built      a     station          there        in     1930, was         responsible          for

spreading Christianity among the Abu'                             fin their terms) "pagans".

       Realising       that the           pastoral duties                 were beyond            his individual

capacity to cope with, he and his fellow congregational member, Father

Richard       Kunze,    who         was    stationed           at        Yakamul       at    the     same      time,

established a catechetical training centre at this parish.                                               Young men

from the coast and inland were selected, taught smatterinss of pidgin

English and were told to go to Yakamul for two or three years literacy

and pastoral training. Promising students, as noted in chapter 1, were

sent    off    for     further        pastoral          training          at    St.Xavier's          on    Kairiru

island.        The     rest    returned           to    their       respective          villages          to   teach

religion,       simple arithmetic,                reading,          writing,          simple       history,       and

geography       (mainly of Europe and                   Israel).           The medium of instruction

was    Tok    Pisin.         Attendance           was    compulsory until                   the    day    students

passed       their     religious          tests        and     were        baptized.         A     few    brighter

students continued to attend classes, or became asistant catechists to

the established salaried catechists until such time as they were able

to open up a bush catechist school and run it on their own.                                                For the

majority,       baptism        was        the     end        of     their        formal       non-traditional

education.

       It     was not    until        the       late 1950s           and       1960s    that a       handful of

Womsis and Amom children were fortunate to have themselves enrolled in
                                                                                          25


a few of the English-medium schools outside the Abu'                    area. Nearly all

of them have proceeded to become members of the educated Papua New

Guinean elite.

        'l`ht: example and sheer hard work shown by this group, including

the author, have become models,                as it were,      that many Abu1       parents

want    their children     to    emulate.        Consequently,     many Abu1     children,

especially from Womsis and Wolum were brought down to                      the parochial

English-medium school at Suain in the 1970s. During that period,                         the

Abu’    student population constituted about 30 per cent of the                        total

Suain community school enrolment.

        Other   Abu'   children attended          schools     at Aitape,   Dreikikir and

Maprik where they could find a place and protection.'^

        Although some succeeded          in getting enrolled at the two Sandaun

provincial      high   schools     at    Aitape,     and    subsequently   at    different

tertiary    institutions,       for     the majority,       grade six   was    the   end of

their formal non-traditional education. Most of them returned to their

villages and continue to live village life, although it is not always

appreciated      by    ambitious       members     of the group.     Many feel that the

state     has   unjustifiably         denied     them   the    right to continue       their

schooling beyond the primary level.



  ʒlhe author, for example, started his formal education at the Womsis
catechist school in 1955» then at Raihu, about six kilometres from
Aitape township, and went to Bongos in 1957 to attend the catechist
school there. He was baptized there and was then to be sent by his
uncle, Joseph Ubaim (the head-catechist at Bongos then), to attend an
English-medium school at Warabung near Yangoru. Instead of going to
Warabung, he returned to his parents who were patients at the leper
colony at that time. He continued his education there and eventually
got himself enrolled at the St.    Anna Catholic Mission School, and
then on to St. Ignatius primary (both are located in the Aitape
environs). He was then sent over to do his secondary schooling on
Seleo Island. After completing Form 2, he went on to St. Fidelis
College in Alexishafen. north of Madang town. There he finished his
Form 6 in 1970 and was then sent down to the major Catholic seminary
in Bomana, near Port Moresby.     After a couple years of priestly
studies, he left and enrolled for studies at the University of Papua
New Guinea. After graduating with a B.Ed., and a B.A. Honours in 1976
and 1977 respectively, he was sent to the University of Hawaii where
he obtained his M.A. in 1979«
                                                                                                26


        It is not only the children who are dissatisfied.                            Many parents

became very discouraged when their children failed to reach the high

school entry level               exam or if their children obtained                  the required

grade but were not chosen to                      go on     to high     school.    The   degree of

dissatisfaction is now further heightened by the recent Womsis school

grade six exam and subsequent high school students selection. Because

of the quota system imposed upon all schools by the state, only 25 per

cent of the grade six finalists will find a place in high schools. The

rest have to contend with                         village life.       Interestingly,     the trend

is now slowly changing.                  Parents and children are now accepting the

fact that the national and provincial governments do not have enough

money        for          compulsory         universal       high     school     education.   This

realization         probably          explains    why     Abu'   parents   (particularly those

from Womsis)            continue       to co-operate and         support   the    maintenance of

their community school.


2.1 .2.2 Rate of Literacy

        Literacy, defined here as the ability to recognize written words

and     to    be    able       to     write      (anything from a few words to a letter),

is    not      found      amongst        all     Abu'.     Among the Womsis, the         following

broad        estimates         were    made.      About     75   percent   of the total Womsis

population         of    320    is     literate.         Grade* six    school leavers     make up

approximately 12.9 percent,2’’ secondary and                        tertiary students make up

about    1 .6 percent           and literates        now employed        in the modern sector

constitute 3.3 percent.                   The remaining portion of the 75* literate

population         only    read        and     write in Tok Pisin.         Literacy in English

among the former group varies widely.




   ^Word has been received that the first group of grade six graduates
at   the Womsis    Community School completed their primary final
examination and seven out of a total of 20 students were selected to
attend high schools in Aitape and Nuku. The rest remain in the
village.    Thus the percentage of grade six leavers has been increased
in 1985.
                                                                                        27


2.1.2.3 Health

        Malaria   is endemic      as everywhere in lowland          Papua New Guinea.

Tuberculosis,       leprosy and    skin diseases such as          tropical ulcers and

tinea are evident but eorʌroʊabɪe..           Traditional cures have always been

used,     supplemented    by   Western     medicine      if   available   at   the   local

clinic. Fear of sorcery, witchcraft, and ghosts is prevalent and many

deaths that occurred were reported to have been caused by these evil

forces,    even though such cannot be proven scientifically.                    Patients,

whose physical ailments were attributed to sorcery or witchcraft, can

only,    the Abu'    argue, be cured by traditional medicine men or women.

This belief in spiritual cure often resulted in the death of many Abu'

who could have been cured if taken to hospital in Aitape or Maprik for

treatment.


2.1.2.4 Transport

        The most felt need in this area is a vehicular road.                    All forms

of socioeconomic efforts have been hampered by this lack. The proposed

road     from Suain    to Womsis    still remains         unbuilt and     will probably

remain so for many years to come.^


2.1.2.5 Economy

        Indicated below is a list of ways by means of which Womsis people

earn money.       What is described here is also true for Welihika, Balup

and     Malin.    Amom,   Womsak    No.1    and   No.2    are relatively       better off

economically. The building of the Womsak-Sparek road which terminates

at Womsak No.       2 has boosted enterpreneurial activities in the area.

Womsis and Wfelihika people earn cash by:-


  ^ln 1981 Karl Stack, the Sandaun (West Sepik^ Provincial member,
informed the author that he allocated K4,000 • about 4,800 Australian
dollars) towards the project out of his portion of the sectoral fund.
When this money was not used within that financial year, it was
retrieved by the Transport and Industry Department of the national
government. In 1983 about K2,000 was allocated to the project and used
to pay Abu' men employed to chop down trees through the proposed
route. The money was used up in three months and they were only able
to chop trees along the route from Suain to Balup.
                                                                                          28


      1. occasional sale of coffee and cocoa beans,(usually by
         taking them down to the pick-up points along the nearest
         vehicular roads, the Sepik Highway or the Wewak-Aitape
         road;

     '2. occasional sale of the small amounts of gold dredged from
         the Atob river and Mindil creek;

      ʒ. money received from employed relatives

      4* cargo,-carrying for official parties who visit the area

      5. occasional sale of pork, wild-fowl eggs and vegetables to
         Wamsok and Warn villages and.

      6. earnings from the recently-formed Womsis School market.

        In addition, se,verɑʌ           village type trade-stores were opened in

both Womsis and Welihika in the mid-1960s but were closed down soon

after they opened up for business. Lack of both entrepreneurial skills

and a regular source of income to keep the business going led to their

closure.

        The only village trade store that appeared sɑɑɑe,ssful                 at the time

of research and which made a profit due                to efficient management was

the Womsis-Welihika co-operative store. In 1981, a sum of K200 (c.$250

was made.       Since the departure in 1982 of Sister Coleen                   (a Catholic

nun    who    helped    them    establish   and    supervised    the   running     of    the

co-operative),         the store has virtually run down and its continuity in

the future is doubtful.

       To sum    up,     the economic situation among the Womsis and Welihika

is    poor.     Lack     of    vehicular    roads induces a lot of Abu' people to

leave coffee and cocoa           plantations      unattended    and    trees     unpruned.

Consequently,      trees       appear   unhealthy and weatherbeaten.            Until such

time as a road is built into the area,               the   economic     situation       will

remain as it is.
                                                                                                             29


2.1.2.6 Political

       Moat Abu'       people are aware of the major political changes that

have    been    taking          place    in    the    country.        Radios,           local    government

councillors,         teachers,          and    educated Abu'         have been           responsible for

spreading      and making          people aware             of such       changes.            Village level

politics has picked up tremendously in the past decade. It is a common

experience      to     see      most     men    and    women of all ages                 and educational

background       sit       and     discuss       issues       as     well        as     expressing       their

frustrations over the manner their elected members of Parliament (MPs)

and pro\mcAa(         government representatives have let                              them down by not

fulfilling their campaign promises.                         In view of these feelings, many

Abu'    people have become politically apathetic and frustrated.                                        Their

major     concern         has     always       been    to    do     with     the        building       of   the

Suain-Womsis         or    Womsak-Womsis             road    to    enable        them     to    sell     their

cash-crops and to have easier access to markets in Aitape, Maprik and

Wewak to sell their vegetables.

        Unfortunately, it seems as if political party affiliations have

dictated political decisions in the local list of priorities.                                            Abu',

being supporters of the Melanesian Alliance political party, hold the

view that the proposed                  Suain-Womsis road is being neglected because

they did not cast their votes for the two P.A.H.G.U.                                      (Papua and New

Guinea       Union)       party         members,      namely,        Karl        Stack,        the     Sandaun

provincial representative and the Minister of Trade and Commerce, and

Gabriel Ramoi from Suain,                     who won the Aitape-Lumi seat in the 1982

national elections.

       The     apparent          political       neglect          shown     by        their    national and

provincial governments' representatives has, for the first time in the

political       history of the community, prompted the Abu' to have an Abu'

man     standing       for       the     November 198U Sandaun (West Sepik) Provincial

Governnient elections. Thus Alphonse Salipen, who was the headmaster of
                                                                                                        30


the Womsis community school till the time of election, stood for the

Aitape-East-Coast           and    Inland        provincial     seat     and   had    a    landslide

victory over the coastal candidates.



2.2 The Abu' Language


2.2.1 The Abu1 Language Area

       The    Abu'        language        area     is   sociologically         defined       as        the

geographic       area     in   which       members      of    the     traditional     Abu'     sp^t*5/!

community live and assert their ethno-linguistic homogeneity without

being     questioned or challenged seriously about this status by related

and unrelated contiguous language groups.

       Linguistically,            the     Abu'     language     area     is    identified         by     a

specific      set    of    lexical,        phonological        (and     possibly     grammatical)

isoglosses that exhibit considerable differences between it and other

genetically related languages.

       Having provided in broad                  terms the sociological and linguistic

definitions of the Abu'                 language area, I wish to direct my attention

to    the Abu'      reasons on why the Abu'              language should be regarded as

different from other Arapesh languages.

       When asked about the relationship of Abu' vis-a-vis other Arapesh

languages,       the majority of the people interviewed asserted that the

Abu1 linguistic boundary ends at Balup to the north and Womsak No.1 to

the south,including the in-between villages of Malin, Wolum, Womsis,

Aspeis, Welihika, Amom, and Womsak No.2. A minority, however, expanded

the    Abu'   linguistic          area identified.       by     the    majority      and     included

Sparek, Niluk, Nakipeim, Arohemi and Matapau as Abu'-speaking villages

as well, thereby maintaining that that is where a boundary line must

be drawn to mark^off the Abu'                    from Muhiang and Buki. Many Abu' people

did not know that Weri1             is a language of the Arapesh language family.

What is obvious in view two is the inclusion of villages that are on

the fringe of the Abu' area represented in view one (Fig 2-2).
                                                                                                 31


       Given these two partly conflicting views,                     the immediate concern

is to try to establish which of the views is more insightful.                                    To

achieve    that,    some understanding of the sociological and linguistic

arguments is necessary.

       In view of the interaction among neighbouring villages through

long-standing       social contacts such as inter-ethnic marriages,                           child

adoption      from relatives       of neighbouring           language groups         and intra­

language sociocultural activities, the task of establishing boundaries

(cf. Gumperz and Hymes,           1972) is a thorny one.              The problem becomes

more     acute    when    one    deals     with     members     of    genetically        related

languages as in our case.

       Some      Abu'-speaking      villages       shift      linguistic       loyalties        for

socioeconomic advantage. For instance, Womsak No. 1                         and No.2 and Amom

tend to accentuate          their social,         political and economic affiliation

with the Sparek at the expense of their traditional Abu'                              heritage.

This   is due      to the    fact that       Sparek has        become   the        socioeconomic

outlet to Maprik or Wewak. When the abovementioned Abu'                            villages have

conflicts with the Sparek, the Abu' re-emphasize their Abu' ethnicity.

       In spite of the fluid nature of the Abu' linguistic boundary, the

majority of Abu' insisted that Abu' is a different language from other

Arapesh languages.         This differentiation is marked                by the       degree of

mutual     intelligibility        between    Abu'     and     its    sister    languages.        To

demonstrate       the    linguistic      variance,     the    Abu'   have     systematized        a

number     of     comparative      statements        and     used    them     to     assert     the

relationship. The phrases recorded were:


   1. bulan etin 'one talk', same language

   2. mamine' as dua'           'we only hear (language X) '

   3. mada' bilibilanas 'we switch languages'

   4. mamine'es e matah koikoiyo'              'we hear and speak little'              (bit
      of language Y)

   5. ɪnamine* enes, matah enes, enes uwa'                   'we hear and speak some
      but not others'                •
                                                                                                               32


      6. satah sakuisihes ’they mix up talk'

   7. dika dei’aka 'different language'

        These     phrases            are      also        those       used       for     determining          the

multilingual           ability         of    Abu'       in    other        languages.         This    will     be

discussed further in chapter 7.

        In places like Papua New Guinea, where speakers are illiterate,

or may not            be    literate        in    their vernaculars                (where,     in    any case,

written materials                are   not       usually available),               researchers         have    to

contend with broad comparative remarks like ((l)-(7)) as preliminary

criteria     for determining                 linguistic.      relationship          or differentiation.

These    provide           the   inquirer the basis to                     further examine           the overt

linguistic features that cause the varying levels of unintelligibility

among languages of immediate concern.

        In   this          study,      all       Abu'        speakers        agreed      on    the     genetic

relationship of Abu', Buki and Muhiang.                               The relationship of Abu'                 to

both is subsumed under criterion (4). Many Abu', however, did not know

that Neri' is a member of the Arapesh language family (Laycock, 197’3>).

The     reason    is        as     stated     under       criterion         (6).    A    few   of     the    Abu'

respondents           who    have      had       some     contact      (e.g.,       on   plantations,          or

catechetical work) among or with the Weri',                                  contend that to know and

speak Neri'           depends on the length of time one spends and practises

speaking        the        language     with        the      native        speakers      of    the     language

concerned. A catechist's wife who accompanied her husband who worked

among the Weri'             in the 1950s claimed that it took her about a year to

know enough Weri' to get by.

        The reality of the situation is one that characterizes a "dialect

chain".         The        concept      of a        dialect       chain      refers      to    a     linguistic

situation        in        which    adjacent         villages         of     a   given       language       speak

                                                                                                                55


dialects       which    are       mutually intelligibile                    but     then this       degree of

(mutual)       intelligibility decreases with                          distance       until       one     reaches

’villages at the extremity of the dialect chain where dialects become

virtually unintelligible (cf. e.g.                          Bynon 1977:192-195).

        For example, Womsis people can hear and speak with villages like

Amom, Womsak No.             2, Aspeis, Balup and Malin,but this degree of mutual

intelligbility          is    reduced          considerably as               one    moves        beyond     these

villages, so that speaking with Niluk, Nakipeim and Arohemi may take

place,    but conversations               are not           easily understood.              When I        paid a

visit     to    Niluk,        I    was        able    to        understand         some     of     the    simple

conversations but often found myself struggling to make sense out of

some     shared        vocabulary         items        whose         phonological           composition         is

different. For instance, words like alman 'man' in Abu' drops the word

medial     lateral       ɪ        resulting          in     aman/emen          in     Niluk       and     Sparek

(Muhiang-speakers)             and      Weri'.       The        same       sound    is    realized         as   an

alveo-palatal          f(^p       [f]    in    the    Buki-speaki^g               villages       of Nakipeim,

Arohemi and Matapau, thus alman in Abu' becomes arrnan in Buki.

        During conversation with my host at Niluk,                                  ɪ confused          the word

aman 'man' with the Abu'                  word naman             'tomorrow'. The difficulty with

understanding neighbouring Arapesh-speaking villages has,                                          as     I will

demonstrate shortly, not so much to do with grammar as with vocabulary

and phonological differences (Table 2-1). Since I did not conduct an

exhaustive study into the dialectology of the Arapesh languages as a

whole, my discussion will be brief and general.


2.2.2 Lexical Differences

        The main linguistic feature that impedes mutual intelligibility

among the four genetically related languages of the Arapesh family, is

difference       in     lexical         items.            The    Abu'       are     quite    aware        of    the

differences        and        hence       use        that       as     a     standard        criterion          for

differentiating their language from other Arapesh languages.
                                                                                                                             34


         Some of the lexical differences are illustrated in the following

table.        The asterisked items were drawn from a standard survey word

list recorded by Bob Conrad and his field-assistants in 1977. The Buki

items were provided by Bernard Narakobi, a native speaker Of the same

language.           The      unmarked            items were         elicited          by     the     author and            his

cousin        Joe      Nalapan          from native           speakers          of     the     languages           in     Port

Moresby.           The slash (/), is                 used       to split items under Abu’; the item

preceding this symbol is from Upper Abu' and the one following is from

'Lower Abu''.                  The alternate forms provided by other Arapesh speakers

are      probably from the dialects                          of the languages concerned.                           Singular

forms only are given.

        Since the thesis was not concerned with a detailed historical or

comparative          analysis of            the linguistic          relationship of          the Arapesh

languages, ɑ deftmʌive                     statement       on the     linguistic differentiation

and/or       relationship           of      Abu'     to     other    Arapesh       languages       is    not

possible. However, broad generalizations about their relationship can

be made based on the percentages of cognates shared among them.

        The following            table       shows        the percentages of shared, vocabulary

from the        lexical        items        listed        above.     As    the     list contains some

cultural items,             the counts are probably a little higher than would be

the case with standard lists of basic vocabulary.

           From              this     chart         it    is                              obvious                                                     that                        Abu'            shares             a   relatively

higher number of similar words (c.38 % cognates) with Buki and about

28 percent cognacy with Muhiang, but shares a mere 14 percent cognates

with Weri'. Two basic explanations can be suggested about the results.

First,            there seems to be a correlation between linguistic propinquity

and       the number of words shared among the languages.                                                                                                                                                          That is   to say

that Abu*                    seems to share a relatively higher percentage of cognates

with languages with which it shares a common border than with Weri .

           The second reason why Abu' shares relatively lower percentages of

cognates with Weri' and Muhiang has to do with shared inheritance from

a     common                 language           ancestor                                      and                                 the                         time                         that           has        passed since

divergence                     took           place.                              The                                     percentages                                                        of           shared         vocabulary

demonstrates that Weri'                                  is remotely related to Abu'                                                                                                                           and Buki, sharing

with both only 14 percent of the words attested. However, Weri' shares

a relatively higher percentage (c. 28 percent cognates) with Muhiang

with whom they share a common linguistic border. On the basis of these

lexico-statistical                             counts,                        it                      appears as if Weri'                                                                                  was probably the

earliest                     Arapesh          group      to                       diverge                                                         from                    an                assumed                linguistically

homogenous community, which for the sake of discussion, will be called

Proto-Arapesh. The next to diverge seems to have been Muhiang since it

only shares about 30 percent words with both Abu' and Buki. Finally,
                                                                                                               38


Abu' and Buki might have                                       split off at about the same time.

The        linguistic         picture           that    emerges           from    this     very     preliminary

comparative           statement            yields        the       tree      diagram       provided    on     the

following page (fig 2-1) (based on Laycock 1973» 1981).


2.2.3 Sound Variation

           Not    only       do     the    Abu'    say        their       language       differs    from    other

Arapesh languages because they differ in a number of words; they also

hold the view that other Arapesh languages sound different from Abu1 .

The sound alterations will be considered here.                                          The pattern of sound

correspondences between Abu'                           and other Arapesh languages (especially

Buki and Muhiang) shown in Table:2-2 are drawn from cognates listed in

Table:2-1. The empty set symbol                           (tf) is used to show that there is no

sound correspondence in the word in the language so marked.

2.2.3.1          Summary of Sound Variations.

           It should be noted that Arapesh phonology is straightfoward.There

are no exceptionally difficult sounds in the language except for the

voiceless          bilabial             fricative       [pɔ     (i.P.A.)          [ɪɔ    written _f     in    the

presentation.                     The     occurrence          of      a     voiceless       velar     fricative

(represented by kh in the presentation! was noted in Muhiang.

           A   number        of    general        statements          can    be    made     about    the    sound

correspondences                   between       Abu'     and       its       sister       Arapesh     languages

(especially Buki and Muhiang).                           Firstly          it can be seen that the velar

stop consonant occurring intervocalically in the three Arapesh languages
                                                                                                  39




corresponds to glottal stop in Abu’ both medially (cf.Table:2-2, No.l)

and finally (cf.Table:2-2, No.2).                    Another       regular correspondence is

noted     between       the Abu’ and Buki fricative /h/ which corresponds to a

voiceless bilabial fricative /f/ in Muhiang.

      The alveo-palatal lateral /1/ in Abu' and Muhiang seems to match

the   Buki     alveolar        flap    /r/     and    seems       to   be fairly consistently

maintained (see 5 and 6). Vowel variations were difficult to sort out.

There is some indication that there is some consistency where /a/ or

/u/ in Abu'         matches with /o/           in both      Buki and      Muhiang   (cf.7       & S,

Table:2-2).

        Whereas the Abu'         tend to restrict the prenasalization rule only

to    consonants        that    have     the    feature       [+anterior,      +coronal"l       (cf.

chapt.3); Muhiang and Weri', according to                              knowledge, do not have

such restrictions and thus prenasalize velar stops as well.

        It    was   demonstrated        that for Abo’, aHboogb a. member                   of    the

Arapesh       family,    the    percentages of vocabulary items it shares with

other     Arapesh       languages      seem    to    fit   well    into   a   linguistic    range

 (i.e.,      28-80 JJ cognates) that qualifies it as a language in its own

right.

2.3 The Abu’ Dialects

       As already indicated                (p.2l),   Abu'   has    two dialects.       These are

Abu1   Womenika        'Upper      Abul,    womenika    being      the   word   for     'mountain

ridge',      and Abu*    Ounibisima          'Lower Abu',        ounibisima being       the Abu'

word for 'low-land'.            The former is spoken in the villages of Womsak

Number 1, No.2, Amom, and by the half of the population of Womis village

which is mostly descended of southern migrants. The latter is spoken

by the people of Wolum, Aspeis, Welihika, Wolum, Malin, Balup and the

descendants      of     Womsis'       sedentary        clans.      Womsis   village     is    thus

dialectally divided by the Keteh creek.                         The western section speaks

Abu'   Womenika        and   the    eastern      section      of    the village       speak   Abu'

Ounibisima (Fig 2-2). These two dialects are distinguishable from both

cultural and linguistic points of view.


2.3.1 Cultural differences

       The     Abu',     like       other               speech      communities,       not    only

differentiate one human aggregate from another linguistically, but do

so also culturally. Both Upper Abu' and Lower Abu' dialect communities

are    generally identified            with     several     overtly marked        sociocultural

features       including,       among        others,     food,      traditional     attire     and

implements, and certain customs and cultural practices.

       Upper    Abu'    speakers,          having closer affinity with            the southern

Abu'   speakers of Womsak and Amom, who in turn have closer ties with

other southern communities,                  such as    the Muhiang and Miye,           not only

share their language but also a lot of customs and culture with them.

Lower Abu', being more closely associated with the coastal communities

have acquired some of              thesr     cA>aracieris'V'CS.             In terms of food,

the Upper Abu'         are generally regarded as yam eaters and Lower Abu' as

sago    and     meat     eaters       just      like    the      Suain   and    other     coastal

communities. Emphasis on yams entails the practice and observance of a

whole host of food taboos.                  For example,      a woman who experiences her
                                                                               4»


monthly period must stay away from the area where the gardens are made

and     those involved     in making yam gardens must avoid visits to         the

woman. Sexual intercourse is also avoided in the period during which

yams     are   grown    because    of   the   fear that those who engage in such

activities will weaken their potency. Taboos that are associated with

the yam culture are not observed by the Lower Abu' because                they do

not, strictly speaking, make yam growing a part of their agricultural

life.

        Regarding traditional attire,         the Lower Abu', according to oral

tradition (cf.         Nekitel,   1975:29) were known to have been mal 'k.o.

pubic covering' wearers while the Upper Abu' did not have any form of

clothing.      In   terms of      traditional implements,   the spear woba'    is

always identified with the southern culture and hence with the Upper

Abu' and the bow and arrows with the Lower Abu'             who claimed   to have
                                                            7
acquired the skills of making them from the Suain.
            /
        Regarding cultural differences between the Upper and Lower Abu' ,

there are two prominent things that diferentiate them.             First is the

practice of 'sorcery' ehu'          (Tok Pisin sanguma) and 'witchcraft' auluh

(Tok Pisin poisen).        The former, although claimed tc^fiave been dreamed




  ^The bow and arrow were suggested to have spread to the Aitape
east-coast and islands from the Aitape west coast, cf. Woichom,
1979:13; Mead, 1961 and Nekitel 1975:29. ɪn view of the presence of
the same in many parts of the Sepik region as well as other parts of
lowland and highlands New Guinea, one cannot be too sure of the
original homeland of these implements. They could have been developed
independently by the Arapesh or other Torricelli mountain communities
who needed swift and accurate weapons to catch the wild game in the
thick jungles.
                                                                                                  42


up by a Warn man who hence developed it as part of the Miye culture,                               a

number        of    Upper Abu' men have been trained and have become sorcerers

(Tok Pisin sanguma man)                  and     thus are identified by it. Lower Abu' on

the other hand,            are     generally regarded as skilful witches (Tok Pisin

poisen man) just as are many coastal men.


       The above discussion sums up some of the cultural features that

the    Abu     often       refer to when asked           about the       sort of     things that

distinguish one Abu'               dialect group from another.                In what follows I

will     discuss       the       linguistic       difference's between     the     two     dialects.

However,       as     there      are no        grammatical    nor phonological           differences

between the two Abu'              dialects these aspects of language will not be

discussed.


2.3.2 Lexical Differences Between Abu' Dialects

       The main difference between the two Abu'                         dialects lies in the

area     of    lexicon.           Both    dialects     have     a    considerable        number   of

different          words   and    some     of these     are    presented      in   the     following

table.

  8Mahite Butehe, pers.   com.   1981, informed me at Hambini village
that a man from Bombosilime, another Warn village located south-west of
Hambini, had a dream during which he was instructed to make sorcery,
which is referred to in Miye as arungineme.     If all the instructions
were followed 'correctly, he was told, the sorcery would be powerful
and hence could be used to kill his enemies. He followed the
instructions and tested its strength by killing a small child. When
the child died,he tried it on an old lady. When it proved successful,
he tried it on healthy young adults and found it workable.      He kept
the secret to himself and used that knowledge to kill a number of
enemies.in the village before he passed its knowledge on to neophytes
whom he trained • and instructed and accompanied in their initial
experimental killings before they were allowed to go out on killing
trips on their own. Seniority in the rank of sorcerers is won through
the number of people one kills.

2.3.2.1 Summary

       Presented      in    the    above       table   are    some    of     the    common    lexical

differences      between          the    two    dialects      of     Abu'.         Although     quite

considerable     in     number,         they do    not   hamper       mutual       intelligibility

between    the two         dialects.        The amalgamation          of the        Upper-Abu'    and

Low-Abu'    speakers         at    Womsis      village       since    the     1930s    intensified

sociocultural contact among the two groups. As a result the degree of

mutual unintelligibility between the two dialects was reduced. In fact

there is so much integration that many young Womsis people cannot tell

to what dialect the words they use belong. Many younger Abu'                                  parents

cannot distinguish between the two dialects. Lexical items like those

presented above are taken as alternative terms for the items and not

as words from two different dialects. Consequently, speakers of either

dialect may switch codes at any time during conversation and in any

context    and   each       party knows         that   the    other will           understand with

relative ease. Difficulty in understanding words becomes more evident
                                                                    44


when speakers representing the two dialects discuss subjects relating

to zoology or botany. The vocabulary pertaining to specialized areas

tend to differ quite considerably.

     ɪ wish to reiterate, by way of conclusion, that the Abu' scene is

characterized by a mixing of members of both dialect groups as well as

migrants from Miye and Muhiang villages. The mobility and subsequent

resettlement of migrants in the Abu' villages created a linguistically

disturbed scenario. As a result the Abu' language has been continously

subjected    to linguistic pressures to expand its store of lexicon to

cope with the changing linguistic trends.

3.1 Introduction


3-1.0.1 Aim and Scope of this Chapter

     Straight descriptive analysis of Abu' was not a major theme for

study in the field work undertaken for this thesis.                             Consequently, a

detailed    analysis      of   the       language       is beyond both         the aim     of this

chapter as well as the scope of the thesis. Hence,I will be concerned

mainly with a description of the most general features of Abu1 grammar

and phonology. This general description has two basic aims. Firstly,

its description is intended to acquaint the reader with the general

background      knowledge      of        the     language    and      second   to    provide    the

linguistic      perspective         to     the     remarks     that     I   will    make   on   the

sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in the following chapters. It revises

and builds on Nekitel (1977).                  The linguistic material on which this

chapter    is   written     was     drawn        from   Abu'   Womenika        'Upper Abu',     the

dialect with which I am most familiar, being my mother tongue.



3.2 Phonology

     The phonological system of Abu' still contains unsolved problems.

The phonemic solutions given here ore intended to serve only as a basis

for the practical orthography used throughout this thesis.
                                                                                                               46


3.2.1 Preliminary remarks about the phonological units

        An Abu1     utterance constitutes a series of phonological segments

which     are      divided    into      vowels       and       consonants.       The       phonetic            (or

physical)       properties of speech manifested by vowels contrast between

front and back vowels as to higher and lower tongue positions.                                                 The

central       high vowel       represented          by     a    barred-i       [i]   is        phonemically

important when stressed. The lower central vowel [a] occurs with the

body of the tongue neither extended nor retracted and contrasts with

the     front      and     back    vowels.          Consonants         contrast        in       manner          of

articulation         among    stops,       nasals,       laterals,        flaps      and        fricatives.

Stops     and    nasals      contrast      in   point          of    articulation as            to   labial,

alveo-dental,            palatal     and    velar.         The       lateral     occurs         about          the

alveo-palatal point of articulation while the                              flapped-r,            symbolized

W,      is made by flapping the apex once against the alveolar ridge,

while articulating the necessary pharyngeal constriction.

3.2.3 Distribution of Abu' Consonant and Vowel Phonemes

       In    this       section,                      I           will                demonstrate                               how   suspicious      pairs     of

phones are phonemically distinguished from one another by illustrating

the minimal or near-minimal morphological pairs that provide semantic

contrast for the phonemic variances noted. I will also be discussing

the    kinds     of       phonological                                            problems                         I        faced      in     my    attempt     at

identifying the Abu'                     phonemes as well as pointing out the solutions I

have arrived at.

       The     Abu'       phonetic                            system                          lacks                    a       bilabial       voiceless       stop

(Nekitel,      1977).       There                         is,             however,                             a       phone which            is phonetically

realized as either a voiceless bilabial                                                                                    fricative        (symbolized    by a

barred-p [^l which                  the $ameas the IPA [j]) or a labio-dental fricative

[fl.      The. two sounds                     do                  not                 contrast                         and       hence        are   represented
                                                                                           48




phonemically by /f/.               Some speakers do not contrast Tok Pisin /p/ and

/f/, but others have learnt                to articulate /p/ and distinguish it from

/f/.    In     the       phoneme inventory, I have adopted both the /f/ and /p/.

The latter was adopted to cater for circumstances where /p/ may occur,

especially       in       Tok Pisin loan words that have become part of the Abu’

lexicon.

       One     generalization         about     obstruents       in   Abu' is that they are

not released when occurring word finally, although there may be slight

deviations from the rule by certain speakers^ especially those who are

influenced by foreign language phonologies.




       The    voiced       alveolar    stop     /d/ contrasts with its corresponding

voiceless stop /t/ in word initial and medial positions,                        although   it

does   not     in the word final position.             In the final position only /t/

seems to occur. Thus the two sounds are neutralized word finally and the

neutralisation            process     is      "context      determined"         (Sommerstein,

1977:29-31).         This rule of      utterance-final neutralization of [t] and

[d]    seems to apply to Tok Pisin loans fairly consistently, although

some    speakers         (mainly    those     who   have   had    some   form    of   English

education) have learnt              to maintain a /d/ - /t/ distinction in word

final position. Consider the following examples.
                               r<    ~ z. sh  1
                 /itaf /       [itaf    itap- j             'earth, soil, land'

5.2.3.1 Velars and glottal stop.

      The voiced and voiceless velar stops [k] and [g]                               are allophonic

variants of the same phoneme represented at the phonemic level by /k/,

being the most utilized allophone of the two.

      The glottal stop, represented orthographically by the symbol [’],

is phonemic in Abu'. It contrasts with the voiceless velar stop /k/ as

the following morphological pairs demonstrate.

                               /akuf/          [^,`kɪɪuf ~ akɪɪup-]     'k.o.tree'

                           /a'uf /             ['a'uf ~ a'up]                    'liver'

                         /inuk /               finuk]                            'smoke'

                    /inu' /                    ['inu']                           'k.o.snake'

                  /'a'u'/                      r*a'u']                           'wife'

               /ka'amarin/                     [zl<a'amarin]                     'fingernail'

       "he liquid /r/,                 is a voiced alveolar flap produced by flapping

the   apex        once    against        the    alveolar       ridge,    while   articulating    the

ɑ ccovvx p a. rʌɜ ` g     Voicing.                        When occurring in the word final

position, it is           realized as an apical-trill, as in the word                      bur   ' to

break, breakage', written phonetically as [bur]. It contrasts with the

voiced alveolar lateral /1/ in all positions, as shown by the following

minimal pairs.
                           /rabuf/         [ 'fabuf ~ 'raɪ^bup-]        'rib'

                          /labuf /        ['labuf ~ 'laɪɪɪbup]          'edge of garden'

                          /bul /          [ bul ~ mbul] 'pig'

                         /bur /            [ bur ]               'a break or breakage'

                     / arub        /       [arub]                          'soot'

                  / aluf       /           [aluf]                          'skin or physique'

              /     bir    /               [bir ~ mbir ] 'a thud'

          / bilbɑl /                      [zbilbal~mbilmbal] 'to reflect’
                                                                                           50


5»2.4 Semi-Consonants

     With regard to the aenɪi-eonsonanta w and ɪ, there is probably no

contrast between them and the high vowels u and ji; the realization as

one or the other depends on the syllabic structure of the utterance.

As this thesis is not concerned with detailed phonological analysis, the

practical orthography used writes whichever is more appropriate in given

circumstances - that is, according to the realisation of vowel or semivowel.


3.2.4.1 The phoneme h

        The   phoneme       /h/    contrasts    with      /f/.       The semantic contrasts

which     support     their       phonemic     status are illustrated by the minimal

pairs:

                            / ahul /       [''ahul]                    1 lime'

                       /aful       /       ['afull                     'vulva'

                     /hihireh/             [’hihiireh]                 'k.o.sunflies'

                   /fifiref/               r,fifi£ef~pipiJ‘ep]         'sago froth'


3.2.5 Secondary Articulations


3.2.5.1 Palatalization

     The voiceless          alveolar     fricative       is    palatalised in word final

position but remains a voiceless alveolar fricative elsewhere, e.g.,

                   /esis/           ['esi^l           '3PL/ they'

              /safas/               ['safari          'k.o. ants'


3.2.5.2 Aspiration

     Aspiration is represented by a raised (n). Thus an aspirated _t is

written [th]. The voiceless obstruent series [p, t, k ]                           are lightly

aspirated     in    word     initial     position       and   intervocalically, but       are

unreleased elsewhere.

               /kukuhunef/             [khukhuhune{f/p|]            'tickles'

               /pipia / [phiphia~'fitia~pipia] (TP pipia) 'refuse'

                     / inuk /                   ["milk ]                                    'smoke'

               / du'it /                        ['du'`it ]                                  'mountain/hill'

          /     pop       /       [pop ~ phof ~ phop] (<TP pop) ’pope'

5»2.5*3 Labialization

       Labialization is represented by a superscript [ w],and a _k with

labialization             is     therefore         written       [kw].     In    Abu'        the   following

labialized          cononants:/kw,            'w    and    hw/    are     unit        phonemes,       but    are

written       as      sequences         for     convenience.           They     contrast        with        their

respective          unlabialized          counterparts            as     supported by the following

minimal or near-minimal pairs.

       /kwarutu/ [^-a-^utuɜ                    ' she-NPST-stand'          versus [k-a-rutuɜ             'tree-

'exclamation form'               used when giving something to someone and /hwal/

[hWal]    'to open up'            (especially used in relation to an opened vulva)

and    /hal/        [hall       'Imp.    to    kill    a   pig'.       Note     the     labialized       velar

functions       grammatically as               a preverbal         marker for           lexemes implying

feminine gender.


3.2.5.4 Nasalization

       Two nasalization rules are observed by Abu'                                speakers. The first

rule     is    one        that     involves         consonants being prenasalized (with the

homorganic nasals taking on the obstruents' values                                    for    the      features

[anterior]          and       [coronal]).       This is restricted to some Abu' speakers'

idiolects - except               that     velars       are       not     prenasalized (at least not

at the surface phonetic level).                       Secondly, vowels are                  nasalized       when

occurring between nasal consonants or when juxtaposed to them and only

within        and     not       across    word        boundaries.         The     following           examples

demonstrate the nasalization processes under discussion.

                     /nubat/                    [riubat ~ riftrabE'tl         'dog'

               / bul /                        [bul ~ rabul]                   ’pig’

          /maduh /                            [maduh ~ ma nduh]               'vine, string'
                                                                                          52


      /anam alemaɪn ubahiɪni/          [,3n3m alemSm ubahimɪ]         'some big men'

        Speakers who maintain these rules tend to carry them over when

they speak oʌvʌer           languages, such as Tok Pisin. Nasalization rules in

Abu* are written more formally below. The variable notation, symbol (dt)

standing for alpha,            is adopted to mean "has the same value                 as" or

"agrees in value with"             ( Schane 1975:69). Thus, rule 1 says that the

nasal takes on the same value for the voiced obstruents that take on

the features [anterior] and [coronal].

                             - sonorant           /  - sonorant
1.        C                  tfi. anterior      /   ,tf. anterior
      .+ nasal     ----->         coronal      /_— cC coronal
                            .+ voiced        /      .+ voiced

                    C        C
2. V —> [+nasal]/[+nasal]—[+nasal]

                      C
ʒ. V —> [+nasal]/#—[+nasal]—#



3.2.6 Vowels and their distribution

        The main vocalic segments in Abu' are represented by the primary

vowel phonemes /a, i, 4, e, o, u/, which contrast with one another.                       In

addition, there are three long vowels: / e:, a:, u:/. The three long

vowels contrast with their corresponding short vowels as rendered by

the following minimal and sub-minimal pairs:

       /werin/ 'to chew' versus              /weer/ 'pig' in hunting language.

      /wa'     / [wa'] 'to eat’        versus         /waa'   /     [waal   'feast'

     /bakuh/     ['bakuh] 'sticks' versus            /baakuh/ ['baakuh] 'nightmares'

 /ukuha/         ['ukuha] '1PL-shout' versus /uukuh /             [uukuh]    'snakes'


3.2.6.1 Lax Vowels

        Unstressed vowels usually form a secondary series of lax vowel

allophones to their corresponding primary (stressed) vowels.
                                                                                                 55


3.2.7 Vowel Length

        Vowel     length      is     eorʌrɑstʌ)e. in         Abu'.       Certain       words    are

distinguished from others primarily on the basis of vowel length. Thus

the word /wa'/ [wa']          'to eat' can be distinguished from /waa'/ [waa']

'feast'; and /ukuha/ [ukuha] 'PL-shout' from /uukuh/ [uukuh] 'snakes'. •

        Since     consonant        clusters        are   rare     in     occurrence,     no    long

consonants       nor consonant        gemination                found.    Vowels occurring in

word     final    position     tend    to     be    prolonged      in    accordance     with    the

intonation contours to be described below.


^•2.7.1 The status of barred-i ([i])

        Barred-4 (high central vowel) is a full phoneme in the

language.        Given equal vowel stress, the (barred-4) is found to                                 .

contrast with the high front tense unround vowel /i/ as shown here:

 /d4h/ ['dih] 'to shout!' versus /dih/ [d4h] 'to hold firmly',

                 /nikam/ [ 'hikðɪn]     'taro'       versus /nika'/ ['nika']           'you die'.

However, in unstressed syllables, barred-i is realized as a partially

reduced high front stressed unrounded vowel 9 and                         in cases where [4]

occurs elsewhere in the word, there is also a variant pronunciation closer

to [ə]. As has been ssid, barred-4 also gets inserted when certain

consonants come together and/or are caused to come together by

morphophonemic rules.              In such cases, it is regarded an epethentic vowel

that gets inserted for euphony or for ease in articulation and thus it is

phonemically insignificant and treated as an allophone of /i/.


3.2.8 Stress

        Stress, the relative degree of lntensʤ wAK                        which the syllables

of an Abu' word are spoken, is characterized in three different ways.

An unmarked syllable has the weakest stress in the word, the strongest

stress is marked with a " z ”. Secondary (or intermediate) level of

stress is marked by " ` ". Words of one syllable show no stress mark

since    there     is   no   other     stress        level   to    which     the   syllable     of
                                                                                             54


monosyllabic words is compared. The following seems to be the pattern

of rules governing stress.

     The     first       vowel          of    diphthong   of   bi-   or poly-syllabic words

receives primary stress (diphthongs override vowels).                         Once   that   is

established, the secondary and the weakest stress is decided.                        Secondary

stress     precedes          or      follows the primary stress, and then the weakest

stress follows or precedes the secondary stress.                     (In tri-syllabic words

where primary stress is on the initial syllable, the secondary syllable

is weakly stressed while the final syllable receives secondary stress.)

         /dih                /     [dihl                                'shout'!

     / bata              /         [b^dl                                 'bamboo'

    / wamuta         /             [waɪɪiu`i'a]                          'hardwood tree'

   /nebeti       /                 [n3bethi ~ hembet^i''I 'tomorrow'

  /dihihiru' /                     [drhihiru']                            'k.o.river snake'

 /dubaunikin/                     [dubaunilcin]                           'small crayfish'

/ididiafuh /                      [ididiafuh ]                            'k.o.liana'


         The above stress rules are formalized below.


1. T+syl]—>[+stress]/#VCV#


2. T+syl]---- >[stress]/#VCVCV#


4. [+syll---- >[stress]/#cVcVVC^CVC#


     Stress is predictable and is therefore non-phonemic.


3.2.9 Tone and intonation contour

      There     is       no        evidence       of tone being a contrastive phonological

feature in Abu',                 ʌbu'` is a nor.-tonal language.      There   are,    however,

intonational contours, which vary as follows:
                                                                                            55


3*2.9»1 Sentence medial-intonation

        The    intonation contour accompanying sentence medial constructs
(Ref.        to sentence medial construction) rises slightly from the pitch

of    the stressed           syllable of        the phrase     and spreads       lightly over

immediately following syllables, e.g.,

                aleman   n -a -ha bbul
                man      he(NCE)-R-k
                         he(NCE)-R-kill pig
                *A man killed a pig'

3.2.9.2 Sentence final-intonation

        In     simple        declarative        statements,     the    intonation     preceding

the     final       pause     falls   on    the     penultimate       syllable   to   a   lower

pitch        and    often     lengthens     the     vowel     of the final syllable of the

clause.

                   aleman n-a-ha      bul
                   man    3MSG-R-kill pig
                   'A man killed a pig.'

        In grammatical strings in which interrogation is not indicated by

morphological         signals of      interrogation         (Q),   the   intonation    contour

features a sharp rise to high pitch on the stressed syllable of the

phrase-final syllable. The high pitch is maintained.

                n -i-k-e-hi'i
                JMSG-IRR-FUT-EV-come
                He is coming.


3.2.9.3 Responding intonation

        Responding          intonation     is     characterized       by the sequence of low

level, high level,            low level pitch on the response form u wo hu or on

the final syllable of the clause, which is very long.

             u jwoɪ-jm'

         ’Yes!(or) That is so.'
                                                                                    56


3.2.<5.4 Sympathetic intonation

      Sympathetic intonation is characterized by stress and length and

falling pitch on the penultimate and final syllable of the clause,and

it occurs onlj   with a few exclamations denoting sympathy, such as:

            n-a-buw'asTf
            2mix.SG.-NPST-sorry
            '1 am sorry for you(sg).’


3.2.9*5 Imperative Intonation

       Imperative intonation is marked by ' !1 .          It is characterized by

stress and high pitch which continue throughout the.clause until the

final syllable. In the following example the heavy stress is signalled



        hu'Ci !    aulɑf !
        go         house
        'Go' to the house.!'


3.2.9*6 Emphatic intonation

       Emphatic intonation is a contrastive phrase intonation indicated

by a double vowel in the adjective being emphasized.                It is indicated

by length and stress and mid or high level pitch, stress and length on

the    second     syllable     of   the   adjective    modifying   the     noun   being

emphasized. Contrastive examples.

        numata'  afu'w-i
        woman    good-AV
        'good woman.'

        numata' afu:'w-i
        woman   good very-AP
        'Very good woman'


3.2.10 Diphthongs

       Diphthongs     in     Abu'   are   realizable   whenever    there    are   vowel

clusters (excluding vowel length, which involves the same vowel being

lengthened). When                    occur, articulation may begin at one end of

the vowel quadrilateral and end in another, or the diphthongs may be

interspersed with transitional glides ɪ and w. For instance:
                                                                                     57


               /iah/                                     'footpath or road'
            /ie'/                                         '1’
          / aɪnea/

      /uab/

     /niboa'/                           nimbowa']    'two days ago'

     The glides which develop agree in height, frontness or backness,

roundness or unroundness as the preceding high vowels.


3.2.11. Syllable Structure.

     An Abu'         syllable      typically centres around a vowel or resonant,

which may be preceded and/or followed by other less prominent segments

(vowels or consonants) uttered virtually with a single chest-pulse.

The most prominent part of the syllable is called the syllabic peak or

the nucleus (NCLS). The syllable structure is either open or closed.

Consonant sequences,              as mentioned earlier, are rare and those noted

are restricted to the following:

     a)     voiced bilabials and alveolar stops                 (plain or prenasalized)

(cf. 3.1.2.10).          `                  '

     b)     liquids, being sonorants, have been noted to occur immediately

following voiced and voiceless stops and consequently become syllabic.

Syllabic consonants are marked by a diacritic [,] only in the phonetic

transcription.

            /blawa           / [b|awa~mb}awa] 'run'!

          /brinakuh/           ['-byinakuh~byn3kuh~nibirinakuh] 'mould'

     /krahu' / [krahu' ~ kirahu'] 'plane, ship, car'1

    /fifikl          /       fpipikj ~ fifikil] 'bone'




  1The word could have been an Abu' post-contact creation or could
have been           adopted from the Buki [kilehu'] 'canoe'. Bernard
Narakobi,” pers. com. Canberra, 1984. Fortune (1942) listed two
synonyms for 'canoe' in Buki namely, bidubig (p.16) and karahoku
(p.18). It seems likely that the latter, like the Abu' krahuʃ^ is' a
post-contact creation. The Abu' have no word for canoe. (See chapter
7,p.283)
                                                                                                           58


  /kribelin/               [kfilɔelin]                        'k.o.frog'

       In slow speech,                the   jl   is often inserted in between stops and the

laterals, but in relatively rapid speech the liquids are syllabified

when     occurring         juxtaposed             to     a    consonant       as     shown    in   the   word

ɛbi^inakuh] 'mould'
                                  in slow utterance;                      in fast utterance it becomes

[brinakuh]

       c)The glottal stop ['] occurs after the liquids in some number of

words as in:
                      Z     s.

       /bal'ul / [bal'ul] 'leech'

       /bur'ah / [buf'ah] 'leg'

       / bor'utoh/ [botf'utoh] 'k.o.traditional tongs'
                     _ z         s.    -

       /bar'urn / [bar'urn] 'k.o.cycad'

       The labialized glottal                     phoneme          /'w/     (as in a'wal [au'Wal]) has

been described earlier.



5-3 GRAMMAR.

       This    section                focusses      on       the     system     of    Abu'     rules     that

characterize both the author's native speaker-hearer's competence                                          in

this   language and his observations on how other native speakers use

the language in numerous speech situations.


3.3.1 Morphology

       Abu'    morphology is                 complex.        The complexity is attributed to a

number    of   interrelated                 features         including      among     other    things,    the

intricate morphophonemic                     rules,      the complex noun class suffixes and

the accompanjinj feature of nominal concord., as well as the numerous

morpheme types.

3.3*1.1 Morpheme Types

      A    number        of   different      types of morphemes occur in Abu’.                      Each

type is identifiable according to                 its      privileges           of   occurrence.        A

summary     is    provided          in the following general chart, and examples of

each will be provided and discussed further below.

3-3.1.2 Free/Bound Morphemes and/or Roots

      There are first of all,               two main morpheme types in Abu'— free

morphemes and bound morphemes. Free morphemes in Abu' are linguistic

elements that occur as                      words in isolation and consequently are

capable of being pronounced independently (e.g. aleman 'man' ).                                  Bound

morphemes, on the other hand, are those Abu' words such as ubah-

'big', which must occur with other morphemes attached to them.                                   Free

morphemes are not only capable of occurring as independent pronounceable

words; they are capable also of having affixes attached to them.                                      Common

nouns are good examples.               They occur in isolation in the singular, but

they take suffixes in the plural.



      Abu' free roots are morphologically similar to free morphemes and

are   thus       regarded      as    synonyms.     Abu'       bound        roots     belong    to     the

bound-morpheme       paradigm.         As   such, they occur               as   semantic      cores    in

words, but are not acceptable as full words by native speakers until

they have the appropriate additional morphemes attached to them.
                                                                                             60


3-3-1-3 Free non-roots

        In    addition    to    free    and   bound   roots,      there    are    also   "free

non-roots".         The term "free non-root" is adopted from Lynch (1980;12)

to refer to those Abu' words such as kani, a prepositional or locative

    (LOC) form, which, although it is a free morpheme like aleman 'man',

does not have other morphemes attached                   to it,    as aleman does when

pluralised, e.g., aleman>alemam 'man>men*.


3«3«1«4 Affixes

             Abu’     affixes       are       bound   non-root            morphemes.

These     morpheme     types     must   always   occur    attached        to   morphological

roots.       They fulfil various grammatical functions, such as modifying,

altering or defining the semantic content of roots to which they are

attached.        There are many types of affixes in Abu' , but they may be

divided into two main types:prefixes              and suffixes.

        3.3»1-5.1 Prefixes

        Abu’ morphemes that come before roots are prefixes.                      These are made

up usually of nominal concord elements (NCE) of the non-free subject

    pronouns, which substitute for or occur in apposition to a noun

    phrase in a clause.        This class of pronouns gives information of

    number and gender, and it occurs in the Subject, Object, Indirect Object

    and Instrumental-Benefactive slots of clauses.                Preverbal marker pronouns

    listed in the following paradigm are set off from the root by a hyphen

which acts as a morpheme separator, and they occur as the very first

morpheme from the left of the verb phrase.

3. 3.1.5•2         suffixes and other affixes


     Further affixes differ in form and grammatical function.                      They may occur

phrase medially or finally and are attached to stems. Strictly speaking, there

are no infixes of the type that break up verb or adjectival stems in

Abu'.    Among the more obvious                  affixes are tense or aspectual forms.

These       constitute          grammatically       conditioned           allomorphs    which   are

characterized by different vowels (see chart below). They function as

realis       (R) and irrealis (IRR) markers. The shape of a realis form is

marked phonetically by the low-mid vowel a- such as that exemplified in the

above paradigm, while the basic irrealis form is ɪ- (phonetically a barred

[i]).       These usually occur before the past,                    present and future          (PST

PRST and PUT) tense forms in the verb phrase. The aspectual forms                                _a-

and      i-        being    basic,      other      aspect     markers        are   phonologically

conditioned                  allomorphs whose phonological shape is determined by

the phonological shape of the vowel -PoWo uɔvng                           the consonant occurring

immediately             after    the     given     aspectual        form.             The   general

phonological motivation for vowel change is vowel harmony.

        Thus an aspectual prefix.               that is marked by a high front unrounded

vowel must agree in frontness and unrounding with the succeeding vowel

(cf.rule 1 below). Similarly, if an aspectual suffix is signalled by a

high    back        rounded     vowel,     it    must   agree     in      backness,    height   and

roundness with the succeeding vowel Ccf-                          be`ovɔ), except Portae        -a-

to    -i-     alternation which           does    not   keep the       rule of vowel harmony

( Rule i SeAovj).

       In addition to the aspectual So-PPi^-es tVsere. are ien^e workers,                        There

are three basic tenses in Abu'                    — past, non-past (NPST) and future

(PUT).      Past and present tenses are not marked, but future tense is

marked by {—Jc—} which occurs after the aspectual marker and before the

verb     root.    I will     adopt    the    zero    morph    {j2T|   to    indicate       past    and

present     tense        markers    and    will     ensure    that     it    is    clarified        in

ambiguocs        contexts.



       5.3.1.5.2b Nominal concord element                  affixes

         Abu' being a noun classifying language, the coreferential noun

 and verb phrase must be inflected for concord with the governing

 subject.        This is done by a process where the nominal concord element

 (NCE) or cross reference marker (CRM) is copied from the governing

 subject and attached to the "referring expression" (Foley 1983).

 In other class marking affixes are the Abu' plural suffix forms

 (cf. Noun Class Matrix), and the genitive (GEN) or attributive

 particle {-i} (cf. Possessive phrase).

       5.5.1.5.2c Hiatus forms

       There      are            several    hiatus     elements        which,           though    not

morphologically important, are phonologically so.                           These elements are

intrusive        forms    that     occur         between     sounds    that       the    Abu'     find

difficult to articulate when such sounds are Juxtaposed. An example of

this is suffixation of l-r-) in the possessive and nominal modifying

phrases (see Possessive phrase). For example;

                   1. aiwe      -r -i
                     . father -EM -GEN
                       'Father's
                                                                                     63


                2. aleman lou-n-a-r-i
                   man   tai1-NCE-EM-EM-GEN
                   'Tall man'.

      The empty morphs      (EM) in Abu' merely function as facilitators in

the   articulation     of   words    that    could     otherwsie    be   difficult   to

pronounce.


3.3.2 Word Classes and the Function of Affixes

      There    are   four   main    word    classes    in   Abu':   nominals,   verbs,

modifiers and adjectives.          Verb morphology,      and that of nominals,       is

quite extensive. I will only be dealing with the general aspects of

these two grammatical categories in this section. I will begin with a

description of the class of Abu' forms that are used for naming things

in the real or putative world. These linguistic forms or "referring

expressions"    (Foley 1983)       are termed akuh in Abu'.         Akuh,   though it

literally means 'names', also implies nominals or nouns.


3.3.3 The Abu' noun

      Notionally, an Abu' noun is a form whose function is to refer or

name things, ideas, persons or spirits.              Morphologically, an Abu' noun

is realised by either a free-nɪorphenɪe or a bound morpheme.

Grammatically, an Abu'       referential term or a noun is the form that

takes neither the verbal and attributives or descriptive affixes, but

which may be suffixed with either the plural suffix, if the given noun

does take on plural form, or the genitive particle {-i}, which occurs

in the genitive slot of a Possessive phrase (PP) as shown in 3.3.11.3.
                                                                                       64


3«3»3»1 Abu' Noun Types.

        Among the word class set that represents Abu' nominals are

different types of nouns, which include:-
a)   general nouns               (gn)
b)   proper names                (pn)
c)   toponyms                    (tpn)
d)   temporal nouns              (tn)
e)   temporal noun phrases       (tNP)
f)   directionals                (dnl)


3-3.3.2 General Nouns

       This is a set of referring terms which are characterized by two

morphological types: those that can be made plural and those which

cannot.     These were the subject of study in the author's                 1977 work.

It was claimed in that study that there were as many as 19 different

noun classes in Abu'.        This number of classes was determined on the

basis of the morphological shape of the different plural suffixes.




        The criteria by which the different noun classes are determined

have been re-examined in the light of the inconsistencies rendered by

the plural suffixes. The review revealed that verbal subject prefixes

seem to be more tenable as noun class determinants than our previous

approach     from   the   morphological     criteria    of plural     suffixes.      This

reanalysis according to preverbal subject prefixes has left Abu1 with

11 main noun classes.

        Whilst the query regarding why and how the Abu' divide things in

the world into the different noun classes will be discussed in the

following chapter, I might by way of a preliminary remark suggest that

phonology seems to be a pervasive feature in the determination of the

noun    class system      in Abu'.   Forms that    fill    the    nominal    slots    are

assigned to classes influenced by the "pull"              of the final or second

last "strong consonant"          (i.e.   non-syllabic phonetic segment)         of the

given     noun.   Once    that   process   has   been   gone     through,then     plural
                                                                                                65


suffixation takes place. Unfortunately the rules that determine plural

suffixes are morphophonemically complex and need a lot of work to sort

them out properly sometime in the future.                      Some generalizations have

been made, and        these can be culled from the author's 1977 study. The

rules or processes suggested               therein were described in a rather broad

and   non-formal style.             Among the      rules were deletion,             assimilation,

insertion,        vowel    harmony,        partial      metathesis     and     suppletion.     The

"hard"      consonant        then   becomes       the    nominal     concord     element    affix,

occurring as subject prefix to verb                       phrases and     as suffix        in noun

phrases.     The classes of nouns presented in the following noun class

matrix are decided by preverbal markers for singular and plural. The

pattern varies as follows:-

      1.     A    noun    having     n,-   as     singular    verb     marker,      and   implying

masculine gender in its meaning,has m- as plural preverbal marker.

      2.     A    noun    having kw-        as    singular    verb marker,          and   implying

(usually)         feminine    gender       in    its    meaning, has    wa-    as    plural   verb

marker.

      3. A noun having _t- as singular and kw- as plural verb markers

      4. A noun having m- as singular and f- as plural verb markers

      5. A noun having _b- as singular and plural verb markers

      6. A noun having ɪ- and _s- as singular and plural verb markers

      7. A noun having k- and _s- as singular and plural verb markers

      8. A noun having _1- and jɪ- as singular and plural verb markers

      9. A noun having lɪ- as singular and plural verb markers

      10. A noun having b- and lɪ- as singular and plural verb markers

      11.        A noun having _n-         as singular,       and not     implying masculine

gender in its meaning,has f-s,-b, and -n| as plural markers.

      The rules as described cover 11                    classes of nouns. The preverbal

subject markers also function as cross reference markers in syntax.

Pronouns         and noun modifiers obligatorily agree in number and class

with the nouns they modify.

       The classes presented above will be                                       re-examined in                    chapter 4,

especially      to     ascertain           the      extent           to     which         they might                have             been

determined by semantics.                              *Here I will not enter into

discussion      relating         to     semantics              of noun             classes. What                   the reader

should know is a summary of phonological processes that are involved

in the pluralization of the different noun classes.                                                     These processes

are treated as follows:


3.3«3«3 Noun Class 1.

        The    singular        terminal           suffix            {-n|        becomes            a     cross-reference

marker for all syntactic functions just as its corresponding plural

marker ’-m} does. The class is highly marked, in that all nouns that

imply    masculine gender               are assigned under the class overriding any

phonological motivation.


3.5.3.4 Noun Class 2

        Here    the    singular          and       plural           preverbal              subject            prefixes                are

realized       by     {kw-{     and        jwa-lɔ respectively^ while                                  the      modifier               or

adjectival suffix is realised as l-'w-] and |-w-].


3.3.3.5 Noun Class 3
        In class 3, the singular noun terminal is                                            {-tai which takes on

{kw|    for plural.           The a following _t in l-ta) is used interchangeably

with 0, the latter alternant is a realization of vowel harmony with

the following labial segment.
                                                                                           69


3«3«3«6 Noun Class 4

        The   singular noun      terminal of      this class     is a      bilabial nasal

which gets deleted before the suffixation of the plural morpheme (-f)

as   summarized      in   the   following   rules.      Vowels preceding         the plural

morpheme {-fj vary according to a rule of vowel harmony where vowels

usually agree in height with preceding vowels.


3«3.3.7 Noun Class 5

        This is mainly a partial metathesis class.              The plural morpheme

is usually formed by having the final syllable of the singular being

reversed.      The singular noun terminal {-1} does not become a preverbal

marker, instead the {-b} does for both singular and plural.


ʒ,ʒ.3.8 Noun Class 6

        The rule that operates in this class for changing from singular

to plural is one where the singular noun terminal (-f) becomes an {—si

or remains an |-s| in nouns that imply coUftcVwitj.




3.3-3.9 Noun Class 7

        The   noun   terminal    for   singular    in    this   class      is   !-ka}   which

merely adds on |-s} to form the plural. Where the singular noun ends

in a [-k), it must be dropped before the addition of the plural marker

|-s].


3.3.3.10 Noun Class 8

        Assigned     to class    8 are   nouns that       end   in   the    singular noun

terminal {-1} (often (-kl)), which subsequently becomes the singular

preverbal subject marker.           It must be dropped (except where it becomes

a flaped-r as in the plural form of 'pig') when the plural suffix {-kuh}

is added.      The plural verbal marker is {-kw}.
                                                                                              70


           Noun Class 9

     Rule governing class 9 is one where the preverbal marker for both

singular and plural assumes a single marker namely Jh).                           The plural

form of the noun is marked by f-lih}.


3.3.3.12 Noun Class 10'

     Nouns whose singular terminal is {-1|, but whose preverbal marker

is signalled by the second last consonant                {—b—} and whose plural is

either, f-h/kw-^ are assigned under this class except for the word for

fire which has a suppletive plural form.2


3.3.3.13 Noun Class 11

     Class     11   contains   nouns    that    form     exceptions          to     the   rules

summarized     above.   Although       they    assume     _n     for    all       grammatical

functions, the plural forms change variously;thus no rule or rules are

suggested for the class. Of all noun classes, this is the commonest

and/or largest.      Not being marked, it subsumes many of the indigenous

and loan nouns which do not fit into any of the abovementioned rules

for marking singular and plural.


3.3.4 Proper Names

     A noun denoting proper name (PN) in Abu'                  is a bare word that may

occur as a sole constituent in a noun phrase. Personal names among

Abu' vary greatly. Some do not seem to have obvious etymologies, but the

majority     have   semantic   associations       that    are     readily         extractable,

provided   one knows     the language.        For example,        some Abu'         names are

adopted from animals. Others are coined to reflect the birthplace of

individuals or to represent the bearer's habits or 'physical traits.

Nicknames are good examples of those names that reflect the bearer’s

characteristics.     Grammatically,     nicknames        or     names    that       reflect    a




  2See chapt 4    or Nekitel (1977) for an account                      of    its     possible
derivation from’the AN word for fire (vis; *api).
                                                                                     71


bearer's personal trait, are rendered by 'naming clauses' whose

constituents are made up of preverbal gender affixes, tha"t is {n-} for

males and {kw-} for females.        These are prefixed to modified verb stems,

as shown' below.      All proper names assume the male or female preverbal

markers and other affixes determined by the gender to which the bearer

belongs and not by the phonological conditioning of the last "hard"

consonant in the name.       Consequently, proper names fall under class

1 or 2.    Some examples:


 3-5-4.1 Names whose derivational history are not presently known:

          Nekitel               (male name)
          Sa'uwan               (male name)
          Wehuh                 (male name)
          Katimo'               (female name)
          Sa'uli'eh             (female name)


 3«3"4«2 Abu' names adopted from animals are:

      Unaru1                   'cassowary'   {male}
      Unaru'en                 'cassowary'   {female}
      Dibiah                   'arboreal /terrestrial python'
      Awan                     'terrestrial python'
      Abita                    'mouse'
      Amun                     'harpy eagle'


 3.3.4.3 Personal Names after birthplace or after a person's clan

      These    kinds    of names   are   usually   secondary    to   the   principal

 names.     Many of these are nicknames given to individuals for reasons

 such as the practice of name taboo, which influences the Abu'                  to find

 ways to refer to a person whom a speaker cannot name by his or her first

 important clan name. Nowadays Christian names, being foreign and hence

 culturally insignificant, are used in cases where in-laws'                 important

 clan names cannot be used.

      Males     can    be   distinguished   from   females     usually     by    gender

 particles suffixed to the toponym root given as a name to an Abu'. The

 male gender particle allomoprhs are:           |-na, -Vm, -es or zero}, female

 gender particle, allomorphs are {-V', 'i and -a/en }. Some examples:

    Soko'um -the author's name, derived from Soko'ukama, his birthplace.
                                                                                           72


      Mosbi     - a nickname given to one of my sons who was born in Port
                   Moresby.

      Nubatina - my uncle's name derived from our clan's name
                  nubat 'dog'.

      Erinikemeu     — a female's name derived from Erinikama, a hamlet
                      of Womsis.

      Welumeu'en — a female name derived from Wolum village.

      Monihes      — a male name derived from a place called Monihes.

      Ketehiwes — a male name            derived      from   Keteh, the main Womsis
                  village.

      Ketehu'i — a female name.


3.3-4.4 Names derived from human traits/habits

      n-ail-iyah:((Nailiyah) is a common male name)
      3SGM-be-road
      'Traveller' (the male who is always hanging on the road)

     kw-ail-iyah: (Kwailiyah is a common female name)
     3SGF-be-road
     'Female traveller' (the female who is always on the road.)

      n-i-diwa-kl (The nickname given to my mother's father)
      3SGM-R-break-NCE(for hand/arm)
      man broken hand
      'The man with a broken hand/arm.'


3.3.5 Locative Nouns

        Locative nouns(LN) are toponyms which occur as sole free morpheme

in an NP but which may be suffixed with locative attributive particle

to    designate    the     people   of    a   given    village.   Toponyms      adopt     the

singular preverbal particle {n—} of class 11.                   It becomes the nominal

concord element in attributes when reference is made                  To     the village

or home. For example:

     womehis n-a-fan kani Wes Sepik Profins
     Womsis 3SGN-NFUT-    exist LOC(there/in) West Sepik Province
     'Womsis is in the West Sepik Province.'

        Toponyms may also be suffixed with the genitive particle                        i-i-},

followed      by   the     objective     nominal      concord   particle   to    identify

different villagers or nationalities,such as:

      alifes welim       -e -i -s
      people Wolum       -EV -GEN -PLNCE(suffix meaning people)
                                                                                              73


      'People of Wolum.'

  australia-i-m-i
  australian-EV -NCE(men) -GEN
  'Australian men'

  abu'-i -m      i   abu' -i -wa
  abu' -GEN-PLM conj abu'-GEN -PLF
  'Abu' men and Abu' women.’


3-3'6 Temporal Nouns

        Temporal nouns (tn) in Abu'           are words which again can occur as

sole constituents in NPs. Those showing various times of the day are:

 1.      luhut         'morning'
 2.      numunah       'day/daylight'
 3'      uwabikin      'afternoon', i.e. c.3:30pm-c.6:30pm.
 4.      uwab          'night'
 5.      uwab er'ehinib 'midnight'

        Further examples below show other senses of time-relationship:

 6.      dauna' ese        'right now, at this juncture'
 7.      dauna'            'now, today'
 8.      nebeti'           'yesterday'
 9.      nibowa'           'two days ago'
 10.     naman             'tomorrow'
 11 .    bieb              'two nights/days from now' ,
 12.     wenibita          'three nights/days from now'
 13.     inabita           'four days from now'
 14.     kasabita          'five days from now’
 15.     sawa'             'before, non-present, long ago

        To   show   the   sense   of   past    and    future    years,    the    Abu'     simply

extract the morpheme {-kll from ahulakl 'year' and have it suffixed to

        those   numbered     7—15-     Such    combination       yields    bound        temporal

lexemes      such    as   dauna'ikl      'this       year',     namanikl        'next    year',

nibowa'ikl      'two years ago', biebikl             'two years time'      and so on. The

same    principle     applies     to   the    sense    of     past,   present     and     future

months.      These assume the singular noun terminal suffix                      {-n|    of aun

'month'      thus yielding lexemes such as nibowa'in,                 'three months ago',

3.3*7 Directional Phrases

        Abu’ directional phrases (DP) have morphological structures that

vary in complexity.         The less complex directional phrase is one

whose structural description (SD) is of the form: N(   ) + l-uma}. The
                                                   'oun'   '    '
word uma functions as a post-position directional (PD) in directional

phrases but as a conjunctive in relative clauses.                           Other directional

phrases        are   complex      verbal    clauses         that      constitute    all     the

morphological constituents needed to                      `t'r`evr`   semantic content. For

example:

16.     aus-uma
        'sea-wards'

17.     bunah-uma
       'bush-wards, towards the bush'.

18.     iluh-uma
        'skywards, upwards'.

19.     itaf-uma
        'earth/down-wards'

20.     n-i-k-e'ihi-ma
        3SGN-IRR-NFT-rise-PD
        sun-rises-whence
       'The place from which the sun rises, the east

21 .    n   -u    -k -u -wara     -ma
        3SGN -IRR -NFT -EV -go down -PD
        'The place where the sun goes dowɪn, the west.'


5.3.8 Abu' Pro-forms


3.3.8.1 Free pronouns                                .

        Abu'     speakers   use    a   series   of       pro-forms     in   conversations    to

distinguish: (a) the speaker from the listener, or (b) the speaker and

listener from those talked about. These are forms that can be referred

to as 'free' personal pronouns (fpn). The term 'free' is used to point

out the fact that these Abu' pronoun forms occur as sole constituents

in     NPs, as   opposed to       preverbal subject         prefixes which must always

occur prefixed to verb phrases. Syntactically, Abu' free pronouns vary

in gender and number, and they may assume the possessive particle {-i}, thus
                                                                                                   75

yielding pronom.ncd possessive phraaea to be ahown later.                                 Abu'   free

pronouns are preaented in the following table.

        Note, the terms for husband anen and wife 1 a'u' are homophonous

with the       third person singular masculine gender pronominal form and

the third person singular feminine gender pronominal form.                                Similarly

their       respective plural                     forms    (viz.   amum and awuw)   are homophonous

with the third person plural masculine gender pronominal form and the

 third personal plural feminine gender pronominal form.                               Context of •

 conversation or discourse determines the semantic distinctions among

 the words concerned.




3.J.8.2 Interrogative Pronouns.

       In addition to personal pronouns there are two forms that may be

used in interrogative utterances.                            These are emi and ɪnelein, which

approximate the English ’who’ and 'what' respectively.                               When occurring

in clause initial position, they are subjects of clauses, while they

are objects when occurring clause finally.                              Other interrogative forms

will be described later.                          Consider the following examples:

       emi              ɪɪ “a "ha ~       ,   .
       WH-Q(Sbj)        3SGN -R -hit -3SGF(Obj)
       'Who hit her’.
                                                                                      76
    w
   k -a -ha emi
   3SGF -R -hit WH-Q(Obj)
   'She hit who' ?

   melein     n -a -ha -'
   WH-Q(Sbj) 3SGM -R -hit 3SGF(Obj)
   'What (thing) hit her.'

 Nufaul n -a -ha   melein
 Nufaul 3SGM -R -hit/kill WH-Q(Obj)
 Nufaul he-killed what.
 'What did Nufaul hit/kill ' ?


3.3.8.3      Pronominal Subject Markers

     Pronominal subject markers are a series of personal prefixes

('bound, pronouns') occurring as the very first constituents in

compounded verb phrases and varying in number and gender as summarized

in the following chart.            Although grammatically redundant, they must

by the rule of nominal concordance occur prefixed to verb phrases,

except for the imperative (IMP) forms of verbs, which occur subjectless.

     In addition,there are               preverbal subject markers. These vary in

number     and       class   according     to    the   phonological    "pull"    of   the

cross-reference          marker     of     the    given    class      terminal    (i.e.

non-syllabic         consonant)    of    the noun phrase.    Examples of these have

been shown in the noun class matrix presented above                     (Table:- 3-4).

Presented in the following table are pronominal forms.

                      Table 3-6:        Pro-nominal Subject Markers

3.ʒ.8.4 Relative pronouns

      Abu     forms used       as relativizers               consist of

whose internal structure is analogous to that of demonstrative phrases

and so they will be dealt with later on in the chapter.


3.3.9 Nominal Modifiers

      The following discussion will be mainly concerned with the class

of   items   which     occur with            nouns    to     express a           range    of   semantic

contrasts     such    as      quality,        quantity,       number,       and demonstrativity.

This class consists of the various sorts of modifier-roots, attached

to which are inflectional affixes marking the gender, number and the

attributional        value    of   the       head    noun     of    the    modifier phrase.         The

following categories of nominal modifiers are recognized in Abu': (a)

pointer words        (or demonstratives),             (b) attributives             (adjectives) and

(c) quantifiers. Let us consider each of these categories.


3.3.9.1 Pointer words (ckeictics)

      To    indicate    the    location of            the subject or object of a given

clause,      Abu'     speakers         use     a      small        class     of      pointer     words

                           whose   roots       are    {    -a-/-e-)        and    {-i}.    The   former

morphologically-conditioned                  allomorphs            function        principally       as

proximal     deictics         (pd),      the        latter     as     distal        deictics      (dd).

Demonstrative phrases (Dp) consist of a head noun symbolized by _N in

the initial position of a clause, and a complex demonstrative word,

consisting, in order of occurrence, of the deictic element followed

by the nominal concord element (NCE), which obligatorily varies in

number and class with the head noun, and a repetition of the deictic

element.     The demonstrative word that hosts the proximal deictic roots

takes the following morphological ordering:
               (N) + {{-a-)} -jN(root)) -{{-a-}}



      Some    examples       are      provided       below.

5.3-9«2 Indefinite demonstrative

        The indefinite demonstrative (ID) is marked by the root {-n-},

which must be prefixed with the demonstrative particle {a/e} and must

be suffixed with the nominal concord element which agrees in number and

class with the head noun.         The usual syntactic linear ordering is: ID + N

        Some examples:

12.(a) sg. e -n -e -n         alifen
          dem -ID -EV -NCE   person

            dem -ID -EV -NCE -EV                stones
            'Some stones.'


3.3.9-3 Adjectives

        Adjectives (Adj) in Abu' are attributive words whose grammatical

function is        to describe       (good,    bad,    big,     small,    red,    green    etc.   )

features of nouns. The category subsumes nominal modifiers that belong

to the paradigm 'Adjective'. Morphologically, these nominal modifiers

constitute simple and complex lexical words. Simple forms include

lexical (or derived) word roots,while complex ones constitute both the

roots      to     which      cross   reference        markers     (NCE)     and    the     suffix

attributive particles (A?) !-i} or j-ri} are attached. The former (AP)

occurs where a NCE ends in consonant while {-ri-} occurs with those ending in

vowels.        Syntacti 'ally, the attributive lexical word consists of the

attributive       root which occurs at the utterance initial position. It

is followed by the nominal concord inflectional affix,which by rule of

noun     agreement        must agree in       number and class with the head noun.

These are        eʌoseed-      by the attributive suffixes               {—i} and j-rij. The

syntactic order described is usually maintained if emphasis is to be

placed on the noun modified. A shift in syntactic position between the

head noun and the nominal modifier (phrase) results in a shifting of

3.3.9.4 Colour Terms

       Colour terms are adjectival forms, and as such take on

inflectional affixes that include the nominal concord element

and the attributive suffix.                      The following are the basic colour term

adjectives in Abu*.

3.5.10 Quantifiers

      Nouns may also be quantified or enumerated in Abu' by (a) use of

cardinal numbers, (b) a doubling or duplication of cardinal numbers,

(c) plural markers (i.e.subject or object forms)                         (d) use of welei- 'a

lot, many' and (e) use of ene-           'some'.


3.3.10.1 Cardinal Numbers

     The Abu' counting system is based on a modified quinary system

(Nekitel 1977). It is based            essentially on fingers and toes, so the

highest unit is twenty. Such counting systems are very common among

Papuan      languages     especially    those       of      the      New      Guinea         Highlands

(Laycock      1970:11). In the Abu'       counting system,               the fingers and toes


constitute the individual digits and the limbs split the system into
                                                                                                   83


units of fives such that one lot of five is rendered by lakl wa1arakl

 other hand', two lots of five is lakuh biakuh 'two hands', three lots

of five is lakuh biakuh e bur1ah wa'arah 'two hands and one leg' and

four lots of five is lakuh biakuh e bur * aleh bialah 'two hands and two

legs'.     If there are too many items to enumerate, the Abu' resort to the

alternative means available, including the introduced counting system.

The indigenous system consists of cardinal numbers whose semantic core

always occurs affixed with nominal subject suffixes, varying, as usual,

in number and class in concord with the head noun in the numerical

clause.     The structure is roughly as follows:

 ^Probably derived from the number of dog's legs.
                                                                        84



    Numerals between five and ten are expressed by simply adding each

of the digits from one to four onto five; thus 'six', 'seven', 'eight',

and 'nine' are expressed as follows:

   lakl wa'ara-kl e     etin
   hand other-NCE and one
   'Five plus one' or ' 5 +1=6.’

  lakl wa'ara -kl     e   bi -e          -s
  hand other -NCE and two NCE            NCE(PL)
  'Five and two' or '5 + 2 = 7.'

  lakl wa'ara-kl    e we      -n -i —s
  hand other -NCE and three -EC-EV -NCE(PL)
  'Five and three' or 5 + 5 = 8.'

  lakl wa'ara-kl     e         nubat -i -s
  hand other -NCE and          dog    -EV-NCE(PL)
  'Five and four' or 5        4 = 9.'

     The same principle applies to the counting of numbers between 10

and 15 so that ten is lakuh biakuh 'two hands', while 15 is expressed

by adding bur'ah atuh 'one leg' to 'two hands', and 20 is made up of 10

fingers and 10 toes or., in shortɔtwo hands and two legs.


5-5.10.2 Doubling

     The second method of enumerating items is by a use of        a

modified    doubling system    where numbers beyond one are doubled.   For

instance:

  bies        i   bi e s    = nubatis
 'Two things and two things = four things' or '2 + 2 = 4.'

  wenis        i wenis          = lakl wa'arakl e    etin
 'Three things and three things = one hand     and a thing or 5 + 5 =6


5.5.10.5 Plural affixes

     Nouns are always obligatorily marked for singular and plural,

independent of enumeration.
                                                                                     85


3-5.10.4 use of weɪei- 'many/a lot' and enes 'some.1

     Great numbers of things or people can be expressed by the use of

welei- 'a lot'   or 'many' and idefinite number may be expressed by the

use of enes 'some.' For instance:                                       '

    alife-s   welei      -s      -i
    people-PL a lot/many-NCE(PL)-GEN
    'Many/ a lot of people.'

  ana -m          alemam
  some-NCE(PL)    men
 'Some men.'

     A point needs to be made that at present, the introduced counting

system is preferred to the Abu' seketerihes 'counting' system because

it is less cumbersome. The rule of nominal concordance again applies.

Consequently,    the borrowed numerical items are made to assume nominal

suffixes in agreement with the gender, number and class of the noun

quantified in the numerical phrase. Thus it is common; to hear:

    alema-m   twentipeie. -i -m
    man -PL twenty         -EV-NCE(PL)
    'There are twenty men'.

    numata-wa tripeie       -i -wa
    women -PLM three        -EV-NCE(PLM)
    'There are three women'.

    bur-kuh handetpeie     -i -kuh
    pig-PLM hundred        -EV-NCE(PLM)
    'There are one hundred pigs'.


3.3.10.5 Numerical adverbs

     Forms that indicate the number of          times an event takes place are

derived from the cardinal numbers. The adverbial root is marked by the

suffix   {-h}5 which   must     be   preceded    by   the   numerical       stems.

Theoretically the system is open ended.

          ate-h            'once'
          bie-h            'twice'
          weni-h           'trice'
          nubate-h         'four times'
                                                                                      86


3-3-10.6 Ordinal numbers

     To designate and specify the order of appearance of persons or

things in sequence, the Abu' use clausal constructions such as :

   betoin    n -e -ke     -ri’       eti -n -i
   child     NCE-IRR-make -go-before one -NCE-LOC
   'The first child / The child that came l'irsf'.

    nubat t -e -ke -ki'             -i
    dog    NCE-IRR-make-come-after-LOC
    'The second dog. /The dog that came second'.

     Different      semantic   interpretations      of    such   constructions       are

determined by the context of discourse.


5-3-11 Adverbial Forms

      There are a number of forms used in Abu' to indicate the manner

 in which actions are performed and these seem to be the only forms

that are realised by partial or complete reduplication.                 In this

class also are adverbial locatives.

3.3.11.1    Manner adverbs

mehif/ehi                   'quick, fast . . . '
mehifmehif/ehiehi           'quick + quick' = 'quickly'
so'ubul                     'slow, careful ...'
soso'ubul/so'uso'u bul      'slow + slow /careful + careful'= 'slowly/
                                                               carefully'
mete'                         'be silent1
mete'mete'                    'silent + silent' = 'silently'
kusu'a                        'quiet' .
kusukusu'a                    'quiet + quiet' = 'quietly'

     The above manner adverb forms can be nominalised, thus resulting

in complex relative clausal constructions.               When occurring before the

verbal     phrases, they    describe    the    manner    in   which   an    action    is

performed. We will return to this later (see clauses).


3.3.11.2 Locative and directional markers

     Locatives      are a   small class       of free stems which occur in the

Locative    slots   in    clauses and         in-Ike modifier    slot      of modified

locative phrases. These are listed below.

    akena      'here'    (nearer to speaker)

    akanai' 'here (nearer to listener) near by'
    kani    'there, that place'
                                                                                87


     kano:   'way over there' (nearer to neither speaker nor listener)
     anakin 'some place'
     loukuni 'a long way'
     bedehis 'near'
     anaken 'some place'
     anaken dei'aken 'another place'
     numun   'inside'
     ade'    'outside'
     iluh    'above, higher elevation, sky, heaven'
     itaf    'below, on earth'
     su'ulamun 'underneath'
     wa'ar     'side'

      The   first four of the above locative stems form a subclass o£

locative relators and occur in the relator slot of Locative Relator

Axis phrase with the following locatives:              loukuni,   bedehis, anaken,

numun, ade', iluh' itaf, su'ulamun', wa'ar. For example:

       kani numun
       LOC inside
       'There inside.'                     «

     kan-i   wa'ar
     LOC-dd side
     'That/the other side'.

      akanai' bedehis        'there near by'


3«3>11-3 Possession

     Possession is marked by the morpheme {-i} which, as shown in

a number of previous examples, must be suffixed to the possessor

noun or pronoun in utterance-final position.            The rules for forming

possessive phrases are similar to those described for forming

adjectives and thus need not be reiterated.            Some examples are

provided below.

                             Table 3-10:       Possessives

I   nubauwk 'dogs’       i        nubawki           'dogs''
                                                                                   88


3-5.11.4 Connectives

     Two    allomorphs    which   function   primarily   as   phrase    or   clause

connectors are recognized in Abu'.         They are realised phonetically as

{i} or {e}, in free variation, and occur between two or more independent

speech utterances to express grammatical or syntactical relationship

between naming words.      For instance:

    anen i         iye1
    3SGM Con j     1SG
   'He and 1'

    'a'u'      i   anen
    she/wife and he/husband
    'She and he. Husband and wife'.

    nubat e   bul
    dog Conj pig
    'A dog and a pig'.

    uul    1    -u-wara    e      1   -a-us    utam tata
    snake Subj -R-go-down Conj    Subj-R-enter stone rock
    'A snake went down and entered a rock'.


75.5-12 Emphasis

     Emphasis    placed on   an utterance     to draw    the attention       of   the

listener To a      specific item   mentioned in    an utterance    is    done     as

follows:


     a) by use of supra-segmental stress which falls on the word
     (in particular the syllabic nucleus) to be emphasized.

     .alemam      ubah-i -m -i
      men         big -EV-NCE-AP
      'The big men'/ The men are big'.


     b) by overt specifications such as speech events and direct
     reference to personal presence in the location at the time
     when an event occurred.

     (i) a      -tir -i -s      nai-f   ie' -i
         1SG-R -see -EV-NCE(PL) eye-PL 1SG -GEN
         'ɪ saw them(persons/things) with my eyes'.

     (ii)   edilisi      ie' a     -tir-i -s
            affirmative 1SG ISG-R-see-EV-NCE(Obj)
            '1 truly/factually saw them'.

     c) by use of an intensifier form whose phonological composition
     is homophonic with the distal deictic described earlier.
     Possible homophonic clash between the intensifier and distal
                                                                            89


        deictic are avoided by a context determined rule that
        demands the syntactic positioning of the forms. Hence, the
        distal deictic form occurs preceding the adjectival phrase
        and the intensifier form occurs after the adjectival phrase.
        The rule is strictly adhered to if semantic contrast between
        the two are to be maintained in those constructions where
        the two forms occur, e.g.,                            '

              aul   lali     ubahili lali
              eel   that-eel big-NCE NCE-very
              'That big eel./ That is a very big eel'.


3.5.13 Verbal forms


3.3.13.1 bala 'shall/will'

        The    temporal bala marks    the future when it is added to a verb

phrase. For example;

          le' bala      i -k -a -he'
          1 SGA will ^-IR-PUT-EV-go
          'I will go.'

        bala may also be used to express the idea of 'in order to' as for

instance:

         m        -a -da' -a -s        uma       bala
         1PLEXCLA-R-£T-make-EV-3PLNU   causative in order
           e -k     -efi -s
           IR-NONPST-good-3?LNU
           'We did them in order that they will become good.'

        Not only may bala be used to express the above senses, but it may

also be used to stress certainty or capability as in:

          anen bala n -e -k -a -ha -n
          3SGN will 3SGMA-IR-NONPST-EV-kill -3SGNU
          'He will (definitely) kill it.'


3.3.13.2 Intentional forms

        Two forms are used as lexical verbs which govern other lexical

verbs.        These are the optative form |a), and the desiderative (D) form

Ja'i]    'wish/want to'. Actions about to be performed or one wishes to
                                                                                 *
perform are expressed by the use of [a}, e.g.,

          ie' a    i-k-a-he'
          1SG opt IRR-FUT-EV-go
          'I am about to go'.                                           ■

    ie' a'i        i   -k   -a -he'

`   1SG D    IRR-FUT-EV-go
    '1 want to go now.'                                                          j
                                                                                    90


5-5-15.5 Expressions of continuity

     Events begun and prolonged for an indefinite length of time, are

expressed in Abu' by:-

     a) the use of raraif 'until/till' as in

          afa'     m               -a-he' raraif m        -a-taka
          1PLEXCL NCE(PLEXCL,Subj)-R-go until NCE(EXCL,Subj)-R-arrive
          'We went and went until we arrived'.

     b) repetition of the verb:

      afa' mahe-mahe         e   mataka
      we   we-went-we-went and we-arrived
      'We went and went until we finally arrived'.


5.3.14 Verbs

     Up to this point of the grammar I have described the simple to

complex lexical words and the nominal modifiers and adverbial terms. A

pervasive   feature   of   most   Abu'   nominal     categories   is     the   complex

morphological composition of nouns.        Few Abu'      nouns    are

morphologically     simple;   the   majority       are complex and include

appropriate inflectional affixes for semantic and contextual

preciseness.   From here on we will deal with verbs, the category

of Abu' forms that signify actions,         events     or states.       We will

outline Abu' verb types first and then we will demonstrate how objects

(human/non-huɪnan) undergo or perform events to give an overview of how

different verbs are put into concrete use, and how nouns interact in

different scenes.


5.5.14.1 Types of verbs

     Verbs in Abu'     are of two main types. Those that can take on an

OBJECT (i.e.transitive verbs) and those that cannot (i.e. intransitive

verbs).
                                                                                         91


3«3«14.2 Intransitive verbs

       This verb category includes motion verbs such as hu'u 'go',

hi1i 'come', bulawa 'run' and position verbs such as kis 'sleep, rutu

'stand*.        The structural differences between intransitive verbs (vbi)

and transitive (vbt) will be discussed later on in the chapter.


3.3«14.5 Transitive verbs

       This is a rather large class consisting of numerous verb types.

They are structurally marked by the capacity of the verb to take an

direct object (shown by either the occurrence of nominal object suffix

markers     to    verb    stems    or   as   separate words).    I     will   discuss   the

grortMnai»ca(    order and the question of case marking in due course. In

the     following        table    are   some   examples   of    both     transitive     and

intransitive verbs.

3.3-14.4 Compound verbs

        Transitive verbs are divided further into generic and tautophonic

verb     compounds.       Generic   verbs    in   Abu',    unlike    most    other        Papuan

languages in which relatively larger inventories                     of them have been

noted    (cf.             Foley forthcoming), are confined to only one serial

verb;    da'    'to make/experience, etc.' (see           above).   To     generate serial

verb constructions, the verb da1             is attached to adjunct nominals or

other verb stems and must always occur preceding them. For example:

         n-a-da' uba
         3SGM-R-pass excreta
         'He defecated'

        n-a-da' maula
        3SGM-R-make work
        'He worked.'

       n-a-da' beten
       3SGM-R-make pray
       'He prayed.'

        When the agent undergoes an experience which entails him/her to

become     the    patient      of   the     experience,      the    Abu'     use   compound

action-verbs by suffixing the serial verb da' with experiential verbs

which relate to the given experience. For instance:
                                                                                       93


        s-a-da-tama
       3PL-R-make-copulate
       'They copulated.'

       kw-a-da-ha
       3SGF-R-make-kill
       'She killed heraelf,'

        Other class of compound verbs are characterized by what I prefer

to     term     (in    want   of    better     terms)   tautophonic     verbs.    Verbal

constructions of these verb types are manifested by the juxtaposition

of   verbs      that   seem to     mirror the manner in      which certain       type of

actions       are     performed,    created    or   experienced    by   an   animate   or

inanimate       agent(-source).        These   approximate   the    English      'splish-

splash, chit-chat, riff-raff' and other such verb types. Some examples

are:

         fisi-fasel        'to peep in and out'

         siti-sata         'to scatter here-there and everywhere'

         kir-kar           (what a tree does when it is about to break)

         fir-far           'to flap' ( especially in reference to pigs'
                           ears)

         tir-tar           'to experience pricking sensation'

         bil-bal          'to reflect'     (e.g. as a bald head, reflecting light)

         sir-sar          'to tangle'    (especially with string/vine)

         sifi-safa        'to shove'     (things over and above the capacity
                                          a thing can handle or take)




       wis-was            'to grumble'

        di-du             'to explode'    (continously)


        Now that some broad discussions have been made on nonɪinals and

verbs, the two main categories that usually make up the argument and

predicate components of a propositional structure, we will turn our

attention to the rules that condition their combination to generate

acceptable sentence constructions in Abu'.
                                                                                                  94


3«4 Abu* Syntax

3.4.1 Abu' grammatical order and case marking

     In Abu', sentences consist (in this order) of an actor-subject

phrase argument (A) and a predicate.                     The nominal actor-subject-phrase

may consist of an optional number of adjectival adjuncts and a head

noun. The noun may belong to one of the different classes each with a

different       nominal    concord    affix,           which     can   itself be     singular or

plural.   Adjectives agree in number and class with the modified noun,

taking corresponding singular and plural nominal affixes.

     The predicate contains                (in this order) a nominal concord actor

prefix marker, which obligatorily occurs as the left-most constituent,

(which can itself show corresponding singular and plural affixes),                                an

aspectual                 tense,   and a verb stem.                In the case of transitive

verbs, an objective case marfer                      which must again be selected by the

number    and    class    of the     subject nominal)               occurs as    the right-most

constituent.       This      morphological              ordering       is   manifested      by    an

actor-verb-undergoer          or     subjeot-verb-ob.iect               <for    reference      these

morphological       ordering       will        be    labelled      A-V-U/S-V-O).     This     linear

ordering is obligatory, and               it        makes Abu'     different from most Papuan

languages, whose word ordering is typically manifested by an A-U-V or

S-O-V ordering.          This syntactic ordering is also found with free object

noun phrases.

     A pervasive feature of many of the Papuan languages of Papua New

Guinea is overt case marking, a feature that is not found in ʌbu'. The

absence of any overt case marking morphemes are compensated for by the

strict    S-V-0 grammatical          word           order.   The    subject    and   object    of a

sentence are indicated by their positions in the sentence.
                                                                                           95


3-4.1-1 Noun phrase

       The compositional structure of the NP of the argument part of the

sentence can be summarised in abstraction as follows:

       NP     “_> ^sg./pP <DEM>                    (ADJ)

                                                                         6
        The     above    abstract      formula     representing         the   compositional

structure of an NP of the argument part of an Abu' sentence should be

read as:        N equals noun (marking the actor or agent) which can take on

the plural suffix which must agree in class with the head noun,                            as

must    subsequent adjuncts           (ADJU).    DEM stands for         demonstrative,    NUM

stands for number, ADJ stands for adjective. An. NP thus consists of a

head noun and adjuncts. Because of the compulsory rule of prefixing

verb    stems       (except   imperative sentences         which occur with no          overt

subject marker in the surface structure), the noun or free-pronoun that

constitutes the head noun of the leftmost NP node, as well as its

modifying attributive forms, are often omitted.                       An example of a

fully specified NP is:




     aleman a -n -a    ate    -n    -a    ubah     -i -n     -e -r -i
     man    DEM-NCE-pd NUM(one)-NCE-EV     ADJ(big)-CV-NCEM(SG)-EV-EC-dd
      1      2         5                    4
      man   this       one                  big
   alial-i-n-e-r-i               n-a-n-i
   dark -CV-NCEM(SG)-CV-EC-dd    NCEM (SG)-DEM-NCEM(SG)-dd
   5                             6
   dark                          very


        In                     fact    that the    Abu'    do    not have     any auxiliary

verbs,        the   nominal    modifier    adjuncts       do    not   distinguish   between

attributive and predicative functions of noun modifiers except that

one is a sentence and the other is not. Hence the above NP then can be

interpreted as 'The one very big dark man' or 'The man is very dark


and big'.
                                                                                          96


3.4.2 The verb phrase

      A typical verb phrase in Abu'                  consists of the verb stem, which

forms what I will designate here as the verbal phrase 'core'. In the

scope of the core are the left and right positions which I will prefer

to designate as pre-core and post-core respectively. Occurring in the

pre-core position are (in this order) (i) the actor-subject pronominal

prefix marker (a pro-form) which varies to agree with the class of the

actor-noun but which can itself show the singular and plural;                       (iiɔ the

aspectual marker which specifies completed ’ and potentially completed

events into a realis          (r) an irrealis (IR) dichotomy and(,```^                tense

marker.    The    'past'    and    'non-future'       are not   marked hence    the    zero

morpheme    \&\   is being adopted            to represent both tenses.       The    future

(FUT) tense marker is             k—}.

      In    the    post-core       position, an        adjunctive   form   marking      the

undergoer    may     be     suffixed     to    the    verb   stem, provided    that     two

pre-requisites are met.            These are (a) the verb must be transitive and

b) that the nominal undergoer-marker suffix, if appended, is not

redundant (because of the occurrence of the full NP).

      Having said         that,   I think further remarks and illustrations of

all   that has been said on the nature and structure of                    'endocentric

constructions'might be pertinently discussed if the reader is first

made aware of the sentence types in Abu' .




  ^Those Abu' constructions with a group of syntactically related
words in which one of the words acts as the definable'head' inside the
group and which has the same distribution as the whole. The Abu’ NPs and
VPs with the head noun and the verbal stem acting as definable ’heads’

of a given sentence can be collectively considered as good examples of

3-4.3 Abu' sentences

     Abu'   speech   utterances            constituting        sentences are             rendered by

three main types: fragmentary, simple and complex.


3*4.3.1 Fragmentary sentences

     Abu'   Arapesh's   fragmentary            speech     utterances               are   typified   by

verb-less phrases that are uttered in response to interrogations or

uttered when meeting friends. These include free-forms consisting of

exclamations and greetings.

                      Table 3-12:              Exclamative forms


       Affirmation:     0 !,           a !              'yes'       !

       Negation:        uwa'                            'no'!

       Interjection:    ata' !                          'wait' !

                        dau'       !                    'enough'!

                        mete'          !                ’be quiet'!

                        hi'i !                          'come'          !

                        hu’u !                          'go'    !

                        faan !                          'sit, stay'            !

       Exclamation:     awomia !                         'woe !,             alas'!

                        ei’    !                         'hi'1,             attention'

                        aha'       !                      'watch out'!

                        us !                              'give way'!

                        u wo hu !                         'okay' !

                        u ho u'            !              (you) 'come'              !




  ^Narakobi (pers.com. 1984) contends         that the Arapesh forms of
greetings are indigenous to the culture, but it appears to the author
that they are either mere loan translations from Tok Pisin verbal greetings
or their syntematization can be attributed to indirect influence from

the popular usage of Tok Pisin greetings.         These were borrowed
wholesale from the Buki in the 1950s and have been used ever since.

                                                GREETINGS

                             luwahef                         'morning'   !

                             (y)afuhi (numunah)              'good day) !

                             uwabikeb                        'good afternoon/evening'

                             (y)afubi (uwab)                 'good night'     !


 3-4.3*2 Simple sentences

      A typical simple sentence in Abu' is marked by a clause structure

 consisting of no more than one predicate (i.e. one verb) and one or

more nominal modifier NPs such as:

  11. aleman ubahi-n-e-r-i   n-a-ha bul kani walub.
      man    big -NCE (man)-EC-AP 3SGM(A)-R-kill pig PP(LOC) river
      'The big man killed a pig at the river'.

      Abu'      speakers, like other language speakers, do not waste time

 repeating       features      that        become    redundant    once       they        have    been

 introduced into a sentence in a conversation. Consequently many of the

 redundant       NPs or unnecessary adjuncts in a sentence can be deleted or

 contracted to produce a minimal meaning bearing speech utterance. If

 one were to apply this principle of economy in speech production to

number 11 above, we will end up with the following kernel sentence.

          12.        n -a -ha-l
                     5SGMA-R- kill-NCE (a pig)
                     'He killed a pig'.

      Notice that all the pre- and post-core constituents were deleted

leaving us with a sentence which,                    structurally, eonsʌiʌ`jtes           a single

utterance        verbal lexeme         .   Internally it appears complex.                  Being a

transitive verb,            it must take         on a   direct object        and so       the noun

 terminal consonant {-1} of the undergoer (ʊ) is being moved and thus

becomes      directly       attached       to    verb-phrase   maintaining in             toto   its

accusative function.

      Not only can a verbal phrase structure be contracted but can be

. expanded      as   well    by   superimposing         or   subordinating          an     original


sentence with additional sentences to elaborate on the topic focused
                                                                                    99


upon.    If in such a sentence coordination is not marked "by sentence

boundary markers (e.g. non-hesitant pauses, etc.) and some conjunctives

(e.g. -e- ’and') are used instead then complex sentences result.

Complex sentences in Abu' are more than one clause, or more than one

predicate.         Before discussing complex sentences, I want to consider

interrogatives and negatives.


5.4.5-5 Questions

        There are four ways to ask questions in Abu':

        1.   By a change from statement intonation sentence final fall to

a sentence final abrupt- rising intonation.              This suprasegmental feature

indicating interrogation has also been noted by Lynch (1978) for

Lenakel and seems a near-universal feature amongst PNG languages.
                 .------------ —'   X
             13. n      -i -k -e -hi'i              STATEMENT
                 3SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-come
                 'He will come\^

             14«    n -i -k -e -hi'i                 QUESTION
                    3SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-come `
                    'Is he coming' ?

        By adding ba uwa'       'or not' at the end of an indicative sentence.

Apart from an abrupt rising intonation on ba 'or', and a higher degree

 of   rising       intonation   on   the   penultimate   syllable   of   uwa'   'not',

 followed by sentence utterance-final fall; intonation pattern of these

interrogative statements are similar to those of indicative sentences.

 Applying the intonation pattern described here to the above will yield

 the following:

               15. n
                                  v
                     _________ >—uwa'
                        -i -k -e -hi'i ba
                   3SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-come or         not
                   'Is he coming or not' ?

        Normally ba uwa'        is contracted to ba, accompanied by a sentence

 final rising intonation on the same. The rising intonation is

maintained.

               16. n -i -k -e -hi’i ba
                   3'SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-come or
                   'Is he coming or' ?
                                                                                       100


        2. By the use of a number of interrogative pronouns or words such

as:     emi 'who' meɪein 'what', uma meɪein 'for what/why' maɪma 'how'.

These WH-questions may have statement                 intonation.      Their syntactic

ordering witmn the interrogative constructions are as indicated in

the following examples:

               17« emi n    -a -ha -n
                   who ^SGA-R-^-kill-^SGNU
                   'Who killed/hit it' ?

        Emi may also occur in clause final position, but then it marks the

objective or undergoer-case of the interrogative pronoun 'who'.

                18.    emi naha emi
                       who hit/kill who ?
                       'Who killed/hit who' ?

               19-    melein n    -a-ha       -'
                      what    3SGN-R-hit/kill-3SGFU
                      'What kill her’.

               20. kw -a -ha melein
                   3SGFA-R-kill/hit what
                   'What did she kill/h,it' ?

        Like the personal interrogative pronoun emi 'who', the non-human

interrogative          pronoun   melein     'what'    can   occur    either     sentence

initially       or    sentence   finally.     Whichever     position    it    occurs   in

determines both its subjective and objective-cases, as demonstrated in

the examples above.

        The interrogative adverbs uma melein 'for what reason' and malma

'how'       always occur sentence finally or always occur after the verb

phrase constituent, directly opposite to the syntactic positioning of

such in English.

               21. kw-a -da' -a -s        malma
                   5SGFA -R -do -EV-3PLNU     how
                   'How did she do them?'

               22. kw-a -da' -a -s        uma melein
                    3SGFA -R -do -EV-3PLNU for what
                   ` VJhdt did she do that for?’

        A    fronting of    the interrogative        adverbs   of   the above    in the

sentence initial position will yield unacceptable sentences.
                                                                                                101


               23.     * malma   kwada'as
                       ’how (did) she past do them' ?

               24«     * uɪna melein kwada'as
                         for what    she-past do them
                         'Why did she do them'.


3-4.3«4 Negation

        Two forms are used by Abu'              speakers to express negation.                These

are: uwa'       'not and duwa' 'nothing' which                 must     occur in utterance­

final     position.           Sentences      expressing       negation       are    therefore

of the following structure: NEG(s) -----> S + NEG.

         25.         k     -u -k     -a -ha       -'                  uwa'
                     3SGFA -IR-N0NPST-EV-hit/kill-3SGFU               not
                    'She did not hit her.'

        26. alemam m -a -fan duwa'
            men     3PLMA-R-j3'-sit nothing
            'The men sat doing nothing.'

        Negation,          being a denial of occurrence of a factual event,                      is

considered by the Abu'              in the scope of non-factitive mood. Hence the

application of the future or non-factitive marker {-k-j enhances the

way   Abu'      divide       events    up.   Those     that    occurred      or     completed   are

expressed in the past tense, while recursive, unfinished, unperformed

and   yet      to    be performed      events are       encapsulated within            the 'ɪrreɑlis

aspect.


3.4.4 Types of clauses

        Abu'    clause types are enumerated                  and described         fairly broadly

below.


3.4.4.1 Transitive clause

        A transitive          clause    in Abu' is a clause which contains verb or

verbs    that        can    take   direct    objects    as    opposed     to   an    intransitive

elɑose,        which does not.

                27. kw-a-ha       nubat
                    3SGFA -R-hit/kill dog
                    'She hit/killed a dog.’
                                                                              102


5-4.4.2 Intransitive clause

               28. kw -a*is
                   5SGFA-R-sleep
                   1 She slept.'

29. Pater n     -a -he'    kani aulaf f           -a -f         -i
   (priest 3SGMA-R-/-go    PREP house NCE (house)-DEM-NCE(house)-dd
   'The priest went to the house.'


5-4.4.3 Bi-transitive clause

       A bi-transitive sentence is a clause in Abu' which contains verbs

that take two objects post-posed to verbs as in:

30. kw-a -sa'a afa'       nikef
    3SGFA -R^f-give 1PLEXCL     taro(PL)
    'She gave us taro.'

          31. awuw w -a -r'ifa -m dikebeseh
              woman(PL) 3PLFA-R-»0-tell-3PLMU message
              'The women told them (men) the message.'


3.4-
4.4       Equational clause

       Abu'     does    possess   constructions   that   approximate   equational

clauses such as the following example:

              32.    betoin ie'-i afi-n-i
                     child 1SGfpn-GEN good-NCE(child)-AP
                     'My child is good.'


3.4.5 Complex sentence

       A typical Abu'       complex sentence is    a structure   which contains

 more than one independent clause.          The coordinate clauses are linked

 together by either hesitant pauses or by two conjunctives, namely,

 {e_ or a}.         Grammatically, such conjoining of separate event-dominated

 expressions enable Abu’ speakers to elaborate or examplify

 interconnected ideas during discourse.           Consider the following

 complex sentences.
                                                                                               105


5.4-5.1 A prototypical complex sentence

       The basic Abu' complex sentence structure is roughly of the form:

        54- CS---- > S. {hesitant pause] So ,  ,
                       1    j      >     2,5,etc.

       In the above, CS stands for complex sentence, S^ means the clause

or sentence to which subsequent clauses may be connected.                             Since no

real    attempts were          made to    sort out    sentence topicalization, it is

difficult to determine the main and subordinating clauses for many of

the equational sentences and hence will                     not be     considered further.

Occurring     after      the    initial    clause    of a    complex       sentence     one    has

either a hesitant pause or one or the other of the conjunctives {_e or

aj. The occurrence of the two connective particles are phonologically

determined. They can then be followed by the addition of the number of

subordinate clauses (diagrammatically marked as S£                         θʤɑ ) required to

communicate an idea or an event. Every compounding or subordinating

clause must be connected by connective forms in order for                               The.

entire SeKteAce to hang together as one complex urɪ'it.

        The use of other forms of conjunctives to conjoin clauses is done

as     well   particularly        in     such   clause   types        as   those   expressing

condition, purpose and so on, e.g.


                     V
                                                                                104


3.4.5-2 Conditional sentence

        Abu' sentences that express condition, consist usually of two

or more clauses which are conjoined by the conjunctive morpheme uɪna

 'so' and bala 'modal form', as for example:


  37.                S                CONDITIONAL CONJUNCTIVE
     afa'    nɪ      -u -hu' mehif uma-r -i           bala

    m -i -k -a -turu -m
    1PLEXCLA-IR-N0NPST-EV-see-3PLMU
    'Had we gone quicker, we would have seen them.'


3-4.5-3 Purpose sentence

        A   sentence   that   expresses   the   purpose   of   one's   action   is

structurally similar to        the above but lacks bala. The difference in

semantic content is determined by the speech context or situation and

other contextualization cues such as tone of voice, facial expression

and gestures.

38. ie'   a -ha'i    uma   i -k -a -turu-'
    1SG   1SGA+R-#-come in order 1SGA+IR-N0NPST-EV-see-3SGFU
    '1 came in order to see her.'


3.4«5«4 Relative clause

        Abu' relative clauses are embedded in sentences and are subjoined

to the main clause by relative pronominal forms (Rpn)^ which change to

agree in nominal concordance with the subject of the embedded clause.

Examples of these are provided below.


59. Nailiah n     -a -mine' ese-i     s    -e -k    -a   -tah -i
    Nailiah 3SGMA-R-#-hear   3PLA-RPN 3PLA-IRR-N0NPST-EV-^-talk-GERU
    'Nailiah heard those who were talking'.

    3SGFA -R-rCL-hit(kill) 3SGFU-RPN     husband 3SGF-GEN
    a    -e -k     -e tama       -'      -i
    3SGMA-IR-N0NPST-EV-copulate-3SGFU-GERUNDIVE
    'She hit(kill) the woman her husband was copulating with.'
                                                                                   105


3.4.5.5 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions

       Abu' reflexive and reciprocal constructions are formed by

combining roots of certain verbs with the serialised verb da 'do,

make, experience'.       The actor-subject is optionally reflected in

the objective or undergoer slot, as shown by the following examples.

41 • anen   n -a -da-ha (anen)
     3SGM   3SGMA-R-0-make-kill himself
    'He killed himself.'

       Usually the r- flexive form and the actor-subject pronominal form

are deleted as both are being covertly expressed by the serialized

verb phrase da-ha 'to cause oneself to be killed'.

       Reciprocal constructions are syntactically and structurally like

the above except that their semantic representations are reciprocal

and    this difference is determined by         the types    of verbs     used.   For

example:

       42. (esis) s -a-da-se'-a-ma (esis)
           3PL    3PLA-R-make-marry-EV-REC 3PLU
           'They married each other.'

  43« afa'    da -retama      etin                    m     -a -ha'i
      2PLEXCL make-came next to each other           2PLEXCLA-R-0-come
      'We all came together'.

           44. awuw   w   -a -da -dama   -m
               3PLF 3PLFA-R-make-pair of-3PLMU
               'Each woman paired off with a man.'



5.5      Moods

       A summary of moods in Abu'        ɪs   provided in the following chart.

Moods are marked by a number of what I will call                   roots (MR) which

are    morphologically similar     to    some   of   the   forms   that   have    been

mentioned or described. Phrase structures expressing different moods

in Abu'    fall into the dual aspect                 realis (real) and irrealis

(unreal), and since most moods are surface representations of speakers'

attitudes, feelings or wishes that are future oriented, most of them

fall    into   the   irrealis aspect    and subsequently     take on      the future

tense.
                                                                                                                                                 106


           Imperatives and permissive constructions lack any specific mood

markers and so moods of these type of constructions are determined

virtually by contextual features such as the illocutionary force of a

statement - referring to actions that are performed by speaker or the

addressee by virtue of the utterance having been made.                                                                Furthermore,

interrogative, admonitive and prohibitive moods are marked by uba uwa'

* or not'.

Abu' are provided in the following pages.


0.1
3.5-               Indicative mood

           The mood roots {-a-, -u-, -i-} or {-i-, -u-}, in combination with

the REALIS (R) or IRREALIS (IR) in ordinary sentence statements,signal

indicative               mood       and        the        normal                past        and      non-past           tenses              apply

depending on whether an event occurred, has occurred, customarily occurs

or will occur, e.g.

             45. s    -a -he'                        versus                     s   -i -k -a -he'
                 3PLA-R-0-go                                                    3PLA-IRR-FUT-EV-go
                 1 They went.'                                                  'They will go.'

46. s    -u -abul lahuh versus       s  —u -k —u -abul lahuh
     3PLA-R-J2T-3ift pulverized sago 3PLA-IR-FUT-EV-sift pulverized sago
     ’They sifted pulverized sago.’ ’They will sift pulverized sago.’
                                                                           107




       47.     n -a -k -a-ha    mahis-i
               3SGM-IR-N0NPST-EV-kill wild-game-GEN
               'A habitually good hunter.'


3.5.0.2                   vnood

       The word uma     'for'   is used in Abu'   constructions that express

this mood as examples below show.

        48. ei' i-k-a-he'               uma-s
            1SG 1SGA/lR-FUT-EV-go       for-3PL(BEN)
            'l will go for them.'

       49. ina' da'a-s uma-wa
           2SG do-3PLG for-woman PL(BEN)
           'You do them for them (women).’


0.3
3.5-         Intentive mood

       The words aa 'intentive'      (int) and bala 'a futuritive'   form (ff),

better         rendered as    'later' when used together with a verb phrase,

suggest this kind of mood in Abu', e.g.,

        50. ei' aa         i     -k -a -he'
            1SG intentive 1SGA/lR-FUT-EV-go
            '1 am about to go.'

51. anen bala n     -u -k -u -bulawa n    -e -k -a-he' kani aulaf
    3SGM later 3SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-run    3SGMA-IR-FUT-EV-go to house-
    'He will run to the house later.'


3.5.0.4 Comparative

       An Abu' comparative          is signalled by the verbal lexeme dahuma

in an equational clause that approximates to the English 'be same or

to be equal to’. The form may or may not be followed by etin 'one and

all together'. Consider its use in the examples provided hereunder.

       52. alemam ■ biom  m    -a -dahuma (etin)
           man PL two PL 3PLMA-IR-be same together
           'The two men are equal or similar physically.'

   Co<v\pa.ns0n is also               by the use of the verbal phrase sihi

si'i 'to be like' or simply by comparative or superlative forms.

        53. betoin ene sihisi'i    n-e-n-i

ʒ.5.0.5 Imperative

     Imperatives in Abu' have no subject nor objects expressed at the

surface level. The imperative mood is often accompanied by loudness

and the addresse        is always   a second person. Utterrances likes

            56.   hi’i !
                  'come*!

     or

           57. hu'u !
                go !

     are     usually    addressed   to   a   second   person.   Their   underlying

structures would be of the form:

    58. ina' hi'i !
        2SG   come
        'you come'!

     or

            59- ifa' hu'u !
                2PL go
                'You go'!


3.5.0.6 Prohibitive mood

     Prohibitive mood in Abu' involves the use of the negative verbal

lexeme ko'isi 'don’t', which can be uttered singly or following other

verb forms such as:

              60. n   -i -k -a -he'          ko'isi' !
                  2SGA-IR -FUT-EV -go        NEG !
                  'Don't go.'!

     Prohibitive mood is a negative imperative.
                                                                                                109


3«5«0.7 Instructive mood

       Abu'    instructive mood is expressed in several ways. Generally it

is signalled by the adverbial phrase na'a                         'this way/this manner' or

'like this'. This form occurs post-posed to the imperative form of the

intransitive         verb and      as   a     rule    must   be    accompanied      by    specific

practical action determined by the given speech contexts such as:

               61. da'a-s na'a + PRACTICAL ACTION
                   do -3PLNU this way
                   'Do them this way ...'

       Additional        clauses may be chained onto the above.                    The semantic

intent is to forewarn the likely outcome of an event if the addressee

does    not    take      into   account       the    adɪnonitive    mood   of     the    speaker's

utterance of instruction.

               62. da'a-s na'a ma bala sueis +PRACTICAL ACTION
                   do -3PLNU this way later good + PRACTICAL ACTION
                   'Do them this way in order that they'll be good.'


3.5.0.8 Admonitive mood

       Admonitive        mood    can     be     expressed     in     the   same    way     as   the

instructive mood or             it can be expressed through narrative texts about

a   real      or    an   imaginary      topic       aiming at      getting ʌhe addressee         to

consider       for himself       or herself          the possible     outcome of         events if
                                                      *
certain steps are taken.

3«5.0.9 Dubitative mood

     Doubt is rendered by the modal aa' amun ’may be', which occurs

after the main clause. Dubitative mood can occur in the past, present,

and future tenses. Both the interrogative and negative moods may also

be expressed in this mood.

       65. kw-a -fan aa'amun
           3SGFA-R -be-there MOD(may)
           'Maybe she is there.'

                 3SGFA-IR-FUT-EV-sleep MOD(may)
                 'Maybe she wants to sleep.'


3.5.0.10          11 ɑʌiɪɔe      ivxood

     This   mood       is     expressed      again by       the    futuritive bala, but         its

semantic    content         is    approximated    to    the       English     'being able'.     The

atAUfatwe and intentive moods are determined by the speech contexts as

 the structures are virtually the same.                             ’

        67. bala      i-k-a-ha-n-a .

            '1 will (or am able) to hit/kill him.'
         or '1 will hit/kill him later.'

  θnɑbuɪlɑʌ``je         mood       is     expressed    by    fronting         the              mood

 constructions       with        the    verbal   phrase     na'i        and   insertion   of    the

 contracted form of the negative (ɪaa') thus:

        63. na'i bala i-k-a-ha-n-a yaa’(<uwa' 'NEG')
            NEG-be able 1SG/R-FUT-EV-hit/kill-3SGU-EV NEG
            'I don't think I'll be able to hit him.’


 3.5.0.11 Desiring, wanting and liking

      These moods are all expressed by the verbal form aa' i                              'wish' ,

 'want, or 'like', e.g.

      d6g. ei' aa'i i-k-i-sira'uh
           1SG 1SGA/lR-want/wish/like 1SGA/R-FUT-EV-wash
           '1 want to wash (myself).’

lr>d\c<xAecA       by    suffixing   the    genitive   form    |-i)   directly   onto   the

possessor noun.             The Abu' also use the verb bu'.which approximates the

English 'to put, to have or to possess', to render semantic content of

the above, e.g.

          70.            ei' abu'              redio nami -n-i
                         1SG put/have/possess radio new -NCE(radio)-AP
                         'I put/have/possess a new radio.'


3.5.0.13 Allowing and Permitting

        Moods of this type in Abu'               are rendered by the verb        asu'   'to

 allow,    permit,or to let'.              The two sentences below demonstrate these

 moods.

          71. afa'     m-u-asu                         -a -n   -a

                    HOW THE ABU' SEE AND TALK ABOUT THE WORLD



4-1 Introduction

       It was indicated briefly in chapter 5 that the extent to which

the Abu' noun class system might be influenced by factors other than

phonology has not been delved into. This chapter will attempt to show

that   the   Abu'    noun class   system   (chapter 5)    is not   an arbitrary

system. Equally, it is not determined by phonology alone as has been

suggested elsewhere.       It is of course possible to argue that phonology

is in fact the more pervasive phenomenon in the determination of many

of   the noun classes.      At least my recent analysis of the Abu'        noun

class system suggests that the bases for determining the Abu'              noun

classes are in fact far more complex.         There appears to be substantial

grounds to suggest that the Abu'           noun classes   are determined   by a

combination of phonological and semantic factors that can be attributed to the




  1e.g., Fortune 194'2, Pagotto 1976,        Foley forthcoming,    Nekitel 1977
and MacGregor and MacGregor 1983.
                                                                      115


way the Abu     perceive the world.For discussion on the way in which

the   Abu    world-view might be   reflected in   the language noun class

system,     we must at the very outset understand some features of the

Abu' world-view.




  2
    There is a widely held view that an ongoing interaction exists
between language and people's perceptions of the world.      cf.   e.g.,
Hymes   1964,  part IIT:'World   View and Grammatical categories',
especially the articles by Edward Sapir, Benjamin Lee Whorf, Harry
Hoijor, and Madeleine Mathiot. Joshua Fishman (i960) also attempted to
systematize the long disputed Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.            Broadly
speaking, this school of thought claims that the language a given
speech community speaks reflects its views about what life is all
about. Accordingly, the study of a language may provide insights into
the perceptions that a given speech community has about the world, or
in other words its world-view.
  In this respect, the Abu' language is no exception.       Abu' , as a
language, is complex.  It has an elaborate system of noun classes, a
phenomenon which has caused some to wonder just how the Abu’ come to
have such an elaborate noun system. Through a study of the noun class
system, we can discover the underlying factors (i.e.     linguistic or
extralinguistic theses o? the Abu' society's world-view) that might
have influenced the development of the noun classes.
  ^Ethnographic studies that provided accounts of various Papua New
Guinea communities' world views to date posited two general types.
   First, there is the view that detailed cosmological beliefs are
 either absent or fragmentary and a piecing together of coherent
 accounts of word-views is not feasible (cf. Malinowski, 1922:403;
 Mead 1940:339-40 and Brown 1972:5).
    Second, there is the view that recognizes the universe as a total
 cosmic entity either with spiritual elements as described by Narakobi
 (1980:12-15) and Waisi (1982:2) or one that lacks any direct spiritual
influence as suggested by Lawrence (1964:9) and that suggested by the
West Sepik Tumleo islanders' creative myth (Andreas Nekitel, pers.com.
1978)    and the Miye culture-hero creative myth (Mahite Butehe,
pers.com., 1981).
   The most recent work dealing with Melanesian world-views is by Aerts
 (1983:1-54).    In his article, the author synthesized Melanesians'
beliefs in gods and established three fundemental types:        animism,
polytheism and monotheism cum polytheism.          He concluded that
Melanesians, like people of many of the world's communities, have had
certain beliefs in spirituality antedating external          (especially
Christian) influence.       He posited the view that a community’s
pre-Christian belief in deities was largely determined by the nature
and the conditions, including the cultural environrr\&<V of the
community. However, the author made no comments about the potential
interaction between language and beliefs in cosmology.       I offer my
views on this vacuum in this chapter based on my recent study of the
Abu' language and hope thereby to make some headway towards^ theory
of metaphysics or cosmology from a linguistic viewport.     In so doing
I am not negating the interaction between environment and belief, but
merely emphasing what appears        to have been misconceieved       or
neglected—impact of world-view on language.

4.1.0.1 The Abu' world-view paradigm

        4         The    Abu'             world-view          suggests      that      it   is    an    encompassing

philosophy. It includes both innate and acquired knowledge                                                  (i.e.    an

integration              of social,                  philosophical,         religious        beliefs,       opinions,

and attitudes) about the community's                                                   relationship with the

world       itaf        and          its                       relationship           with      Iluhina      Ru'anari

Ka'atuman,          the          supreme             deity.         This    complex        world-view         will   be

represented             in       a    paradigm below.               This    rich,      complex and obviously

difficult subject is not easy to analyse in ordinary language. It is

even more difficult                        to correlate concepts,                  perceptions         and beliefs

from        one     language                   -     Abu' - to       another - English.                Inevitably,

translations             whether               literal        or    approximate        will       be   inadequate.

Nevertheless,                I       am    making       an    effort       to   summarize and              present   as

faithfully          as       I       can       the    Abu'     world-view        as    given      to   me     by Abu'

experts. I will use the paradigm to describe it in detail.




4.1.0.2 Meaning of the paradigm

       To better understand the complex nature of the Abu' world-view

paradigm,          designed               to       faithfully       represent         that      world-view      in    a

symbolic way             (especially the basic elements of that world-view), we

need    to    clarify what                     the basic           elements     are.       In other        words,    to

understand the whole, we need to take out the parts, examine them and

then put them together to make the whole picture. We must not forget

all the time that in truth, they are intertwined and not separable.

These elements are:                            iluh    'up and beyond'           utaka       'cloud    '     and itaf




   4 The Abu' world-view presented here is based on data obtained mainly
from my Upper Abu' informants in Womsis village and so the views
represented here may not necessarily be representative of the entire
Abu' community. From my general interviews with members of other
Abu'-speaking villagers, there seems to be a general agreement with
what is presented here, though there were slight deviations noted
among the Lower Abu' informants.

November to late January.                   The wet season is followed by the dry

season, and the Abu' divide and name it as follows: Bikati'en

[ <b (Sub,1 M<walub (1 river1) -i (R) -kadi ('to be dry, or low' )-e(EV)-n(NCE) ]

'the month of low-tide' or 'the dry month'.                           Suwayen [<s(SubJM<suus/udis

the dry season and hence have names for the months during which major

agricultural activities are performed.                           These months are: Sisaruen

     It is obvious from our description of the Abu' seasons, that the

names make reference to the prevailing weather conditions characteristic

of the area or to the socio-cultural activities the Abu' engage in within

the span of the 'year' ahulakl, the length of which is determined by the

ten seasons that constitute the Abu' traditional calendar.     Notice that

the names of the seasons contain the nominal concord affix {n-, -n- or-n},

in agreement with the noun terminal {-n} of aun 'moon', suggesting that

these names are lunar nominals; hence, seasons are, in a way, associated

with months.     The Abu' differ in their counting of their months in that

they only have ten and not 13 months in a solar year.     The Abu' could have

erred by not keeping a good mental record of the months, hence missed three

of the months.     There is also the possibility that some of the seasonal

activities such as gardening usually take up two or three months to

complete.   Some of the gardening months such as Sartawen and Natarumes

could well spread over a period of two to three lunar months, thus reducing

the mental count of the months from thirteen to ten.

     The focus of male physical potency is anchored in suluh uhaka, the

'energy source', which, according to my informant Sa'uan, imbues whatever

activities men do.    The major socio-cultural activities originate and radiate

outward from suluh uhaka and are represented by the radii.     That being
                                                                                                         118


the structural description of the Abu'                             world-view paradigm, what we

need to do now is to expound the cosmology behind the paradigm.


4.1.1 Abu1 Cosmology

      I should point out at the outset that the Abu' knowledge of the

universe is, as a rule, restricted to those things that can be sensed.

In   this     respect,          their    knowledge            of     the     three      basic       elements

constituting        the      cosmosphere          (viz.       iluh,        'up    and       beyond',   utaka

'cloud/sky'        and itaf 'earth') are as follows:


4-1.1.1 ɪluh 'Up and beyond'

      Huh     is devoid          of the      presence of             both human and terrestrial

spirits.      It is the abode of the                    'heavenly deity'               Iluhina Ru'anari

Ka*atuman and all            the celestial bodies.                   As it       may be      noticed,    the

nominal     phrase        iluhina       consists        of     iluh        'up   and     beyond',      {-i-j

'epethentie vowel, followed by the male gender affix {-n-}                                        which is

suffixed with an eperʌbeʌ`e vowel -a.                         Thus iluhina                  means

 a^^rox'urvxote^-.              'the man from above'. Ru' anari means 'the big man'

and Ka'atuman is a reference name given to this heavenly male deity.

The name is revered, and thus it \s                     not                 tɜ    `rʌumɑɪʌ beir^s        +o

rʌoioʌe-    tfttveʃs      tɜ.

      Iluh is where all the stars, the sun and the moon are.                                        The Abu'

knowledge     of     astronomy         is,   as    suggested           above,      limited       to    those

celestial bodies that they can see and are important to them.                                          Apart

from the obvious recognition of the sun, aun arifini,and the moon, aun

uwabini,     they      also      recognize        the        galaxy, alehel            or    nukwaf.      In

addition,     they recognize both the Southern Cross, wa' arasuwa ..and                                  the

pointers which they name                nadikilakuh. Nadikilakuh are the only group

of stars      that     the      Abu'    regard     as        male.         The    sun, uwah, literally

sunshine     (sometimes it             is referred           to. as aun arifini for day time

moon), is not spoken of as either a male or a female.                                   It assumes either

h- or n- as the nominal concord affix. The moon aun uwabini is often
                                                                                             119


personified as a male. We will return to the reasons for this general

association     later.      The   stars are    collectively regarded              as females.

Both the morning and the evening stars are recognized and are named

laramo1 an and kwakeres,respectively.


4.1.1.2 Utaka 'sky or cloud'

      ʊtaka is a bisemous concept. It can mean rain clouds or the sky.

The latter is perceived as a celestial wall which circumscribes the

cosmosphere     and    is    said   to   intersect      the   earth    at    the     horizon.

Mythical terrestrial beings, who are neither human beings nor spirits,

live at the horizon. They are said to keep themselves busy by cutting

and eating the growing edges of the sky. This prevents the sky from

growing out of proportion, somewhat analogous to the way stalactites

are formed. It is no wonder that the Abu' dravJ the logical conclusion

that the world ends on all sides at the horizon, a view very similar

to that reported of the Ilahita by Tuzin (1972:35 ftn).                             Hence the

spherical   world-view paradigm presented               is    indicative      of    the     Abu'

cosmic-view.


4.1.1.3 Itaf 'earth'

      Earth (itaf) is much more familiar to the Abu', being their abode

as well as the abode of terrestial spirits (ufu'elim 'male spirits')

and   (ufu'eluwa      'female     spirits').   Unarguably,      it    is    the    centre of

human activity where human beings are, as it were, in an interminable
                                                                                       f'
encounter with the animal,           the plant and the spirit worlds— a view

which has     been    expressed     elsewhere    (see    e.g.   Narakobi          1980:5).    In

gum__ itaf is    a concrete manifestation of              the Abu'     world-view par

excellence. Let me expand on this point further.
                                                                                                 120


4»1.1.4 Ka'atuman 'the creator'

      As        described         in    the     structural        description     of     the    Abu'

world-view, the exponents of Abu' cosmology argue that their world was

put   there          for   them    by    the    male      supreme      deity   Iluhina    Ru'anari

Ka'atuman.            He is the primordial cause, and the world and all that it

contains is the ultimate effect.                    The conception of this             process of

causality            was   expressed         succinctly     in    the     following    linguistic

construct:

       1.        n-e-k-e-s-i-bi'-i
                 3SGM-NPST-FUT-EV-3PLN-EV-put-GEN
                'The one who puts or creates things'.

      by Sa'uan, one of our Womsis informants. Ka'atuman, according to

Sa'uan, is the spirit who not only put or created things, but is also

the one who continues to create things and consequently is claimed to

manipulate as well as control the entire cosmic order. A distinction

needs to be drawn between two causative verbs in Abu', which pertain to

the analysis of cosmotellurian theory. The two verbs are bu'                              'to put'

and   the serialised verb da'                   'to make,      to produce.'     The use of the

latter as in:

           2.        n    -a -da'        asah
                     3SGMA-R -make       rain
                     'He made rain

      usually implies both human and non-human involvement in whatever

the process of making rain. Whereas:

                3.     n    -a-bu'         asah
                       3SGMA-R-put/create rain
                       'He put or created rain'

      implies          the idea of creating or evolving from a spiritual or a

divine source.             In this respect, Ka'atuman is the one who creates as

well as the one who manipulates the entire cosmic order. My skepticism

       the +heoRj            wŋs         a    version     of     the    traditional    Jewish    or

Christian theory of monotheistic creation was dismissed not only by my

informants'           insistence on the Abu'            having had deism long before the
                                                                                             121


advent of the Catholic mission into the area, but is augmented further

by other researchers'            findings (e.g. Aerts,           1984) on the presence of

such beliefs among a number of other Papua New Guinea communities, such

as Buki (Narakobi 1977:9), Baining (Laufer 1946:49) Binandere (jojoga

1981:64) and the Huli of the Southern Highlands (see Glasse 1965:37).

        In   defending the theory of the Abu*                 having had a belief in a

creator      deity    who   is     more     powerful      than    the    other    natural     or

terrestrial spirits,         Sa'uan expressed the following view,                   which was

later     confirmed    by   Naisoh        and   further    supported      by     Sister   Casey

(pers.com.,      Canberra        1983),    an   Australian nun          who      didi       some

investigation into the traditional religious beliefs of the Abu'. The

view was expressed in the rural Tok Pisin variety with Abu' phrases

being     interspersed      to    emphasize      the   most      important     points.      The

underlined items were expressed in Abu'                    and were translated by the

author.      Some modifications had to be made on spelling to agree with

that of standard Tok Pisin.

        A—in spirit himself created these things and all things.
    True-before-they knew qod exists. They say he is spirit that
    is ɪluhina- Iluhina exists. Whenever you do something you call
    upon Iluhina.    You must not offend ɪluhina. ɪluhina will kill
    you- When they quarrel over pigs, or dogs, or whatever they
    aay Iluhina damns you to death.        True they had all these
    things I. knowledge (?!. They knew there is a person up there
    Iluhina— his name is ɪluhina Ka* atuman. ɪluhina Ka1atuman
    that is how they call him.
        When they do all kinds of things— when you hunt wild game
    you call upon Iluhina or whatever you do - or the young women
    (reference to female rite of passage) or when they make
    taɪnbaran 'cult-worship' or when you show all the things
    Ci.e.food being avoided during period of food taboo) you
    tabooed you show them to Iluhina. You must not just eat them
    without showing them first to Iluhina. Masticate and spew them
    into the sky and say:
        'Here I am eating these things now.'
        When they see the sun and the moon change (i.e. eclipses),
    they say,'Hmm, Ru'anari, 'big spirit', is changing places'. They
    blow the triton, they beat the slitaong, they call- they see
    the moon and the sun change (and) if the sun or the moon wants
    to do whatever — they will shout and call Iluhina thus:
        'a-uu ha-waaaa. wa-waaaa uu ha waaaa.'
        That is how they call him. ■

       In the foregoing sketch, we observed a summary of how an Abu'

cosmogonist presented and defended his community's cosmological views.

The Abu' argue that cosmotellurian creation emanates from a heavenly

deity who they address as Iluhina Ru'anari Ka* acuman.                        Ka'atuman is

believed       to   hail   from    somewhere   in    the    distant   sky.      He   is    the

spiritual cause, and the itaf 'earth' is a direct emanation from that

cause.       In this   respect, he      assumes control        over the       entire cosmic

order.       A question arises:         v)hat does control over the cosmic order

mean     ?   This    the   Abu'     cosmogonists answer       by   providing     true     life

experiences         (usually      natural   events   whose     causes    or    control     lie

outside the human or terrestrial spirits’ potency)                      that were or are

done with invocation to the heavenly deity if positive results were or

are desired. The underlying principle they adhere to                     is that anything

that happens and whose cause-cannot be explained by deduction from

earthly or circumstantial evidence,                        they automatically attribute
                                                                                              123


to Iluhina Ru'anari Ka'atuman. In thia respect, the Abu' do not differ

from other communitiea who poaaeaa theiatio beliefa of one type or

another (cf. Aerts

        Extra-terrestrial events auch aa eclipaea are believed to be the

makings of ɪluhina Ru'anari Ka'atuman,a logical asaociation perhapa of

heavenly eventa with the heavenly deity.                     Since he ia detached from

the earth, the Abu', if they want to invoke him to have mercy on them

or    to   aave      them    from   incumbent    wrath,     they either      acclaim        their

meaaagea       or    relay    their measages     by    the uae      of   apeech aurrogates

(e.g.      slitgong and triton,           referred    to in chapter 6 )          to transmit

their voices through invisible and timeless distance to Ka'atuman.

        Ka1atuman      is    also   invoked   during      certain cultural       rites      that

adherents and custodians of Christianity readily condemn as sinful or

as practices of idolatory.                       An obvious and logical conclusion

that could be drawn from this is that the Abu' had always believed in

Ka'atuman long before the advent of Christian missions.                          Sa'uan, one

of my informants, equated Ka’atuman with the introduced concept 'ɑod'.

He argued that although the deity expressions differ, the referent is

one     and    the   same    entity that      Christians     call        'God'   and   we    the

Arapesh call           Iluhina Ru'anari Ka'atuman which by the way is cognate

with the Buki Arapesh ɪruhin (cf.Narakobi 1982:18).

        The mastication and subsequent spewing into the sky of food that

a young woman had foregone during the period of her first menstruation

by the ritual performer during the ceremony called satufa' au'al is a

ceremony       testifying      to   the   Abu'   belief     in   the     existence     of    the

heavenly deity— Ka'atuman.

        Now,   what of Ka'atuman's responses to Abu'                   supplications? Like

the Christian God, Ka'atuman has the prerogative to respond positively

or negatively^ depending on human capacities to placate him. If rituals

are     performed       in    accordance      with    laid—down          divination    norms,
                                                                                                      124


 efficacious results are expected. Should anticipated results he.                                     not

 attained, or if rituals fail to materialize, reasons for failures are

 sought or suggested.           The Abu',        like many world communities,                   do not

 readily     accept    the     view      that    denies or         underrates       the     theory of

 causality.


h.1.1.5      The Abu' monotheistic or polytheistic

       The   Abu'     Arapesh      could        be     regarded     as     either     mono-      or

polytheistic.        They     believe      in        the   existence       of   a   heavenly

deity—Ka'atuman, but they also believe or accept without question the

 existence and influence of numerous natural or terrestrial spirits.

 These    are     referred    to    as    ufu1elim         ^sg.   ufu'al) 'male       spirits'        and

 ufu' eliwa ^sg..      ufu'elu') ' female spirits'. In addition to these, they

 recognize the existence of ghosts., mauras (sg.                         mauran),and the fairly

remote and distant mythical beings referred to earlier (p.U-9) who are

 unimportant and have no direct influence at all over their daily life.

         Nature      spirits       are    believed          to    occupy    various        geographic

 (usually dangerous and inaccessible)                      spots such as        'cliffs'        aselas,

 'waterfalls' walub badasefre', 'river pools' waas, 'caves' waiwa, huge

 rocks or boulders tatakw and huge trees lawas.

         Unlike     Iluhina     Ru'anari         Ka 'atuman        who     is   for       all    people

 everywhere, and thus is not subject to ownership, natural spirits and

ghosts are owned and they are consequently identified with the owners of

 the land they are said to preside over. They, therefore, are supposed

 to be on amicable terms with the owners of the land,but infliction of

 punishment on imprudent intruders or tresspassers is likely if they

 are unduly disturbed.

         Human disturbances         include,          among other        things,      trespassing,

 tree felling or an act of sexual intercourse within the bounds of the

 spirit's territory. In the event of an encroachment of this nature,

 the   culprits usually redress these                      faults by making reconciliatory
                                                                                                    125
                                                                                               •

offerings to appease the offended spirit                        if a        peaceful coexistence

between the disturbed spirit and the offender(s) or the community at

large is to be maintained.

       An interesting aspect of this process is the Abu' attempt to try

and    divert the      curse the     spirit might make upon another person or

enemy community. The offender must cut off a part of a 'cans'                                     waku

(Calamus      sp.;   TPakanda),    circle it            around his head and            body,       then

throw it towards the direction of a hostile village. This gesture is

supposed to redirect the spirit's curse against that village and saves

the    offender or       his/her   village         from    the        incumbent      'catastrophe'

(kaha).       The term kaha is best expressed by the English 'a destructive

storm'.


4.1.1.6 Life after death

       The Abu' Arapesh,       like most societies of the world,                       believe in

life    after death.       However,        they    do    not    have     any    theories     on     the

question       of    predestination.        The     existence          of    "good    place"        and

"bad/evil place" are unknown.                It is probably due to the absence of

the two concepts that the Abu'              lack3 expressions in their language to

infer or suggest concepts that might approximate 'heaven' and 'hell'.

At death,       people's   spirits     go     to    live       with    their previously dead

relatives      in dark pools of water or at                    the cemeteries.         As a rule,

every clan has or possesses a water pool waak which has become the

abode of dead relatives.

       Unlike adherents of Christian belief, the Abu' do not draw or speak

about a dichotomy between the spirit and the human worlds. It is no

wonder that the Abu' regard spirits and ghosts as part and parcel                                    of

the    Abu'    world-community        to    which       humans        belong.        For    Abu',     a

"communion      of saints"    would        include       all    known and                  forgotten

ʌbɑ'__ living and the dead. There                        no good Abu' in heaven and bad

Abu' in hell. They all live together— the living are visible and the
                                                                                               126


    dead are visible, but only in restricted and controlled circumstances.

    This        rationalization is       encapsulated quite clearly in            the language

    structure        where    human     beings   and   spirits   of     all   kinds    are being

    conjugated       under the        same classes     (i.e.     male vs.       female classes
    (cf.        chapter 3, p.65ff) and subject themselves to the same

    morphosyntactic rules.


            Having expressed this view, I next go on to examine the extent

    to which the Abu' word-view might throw light on the noun

    class system and how the Abu’ world-view as a whole might be reflected

    in their verbal mode of expression—the Abu' language.

            An               understanding of the Abu' world-view may be arrived at
/


    through Abu'       folk-taxonomy; that is,how Abu' apportion information so

as         to     highlight     their    world-views       (cognitive    universe)       through
                     ɪʒ
    semantic domains. .



    4.2 Abu' folk-taxonomy

            Given      that     the     Abu'     expound     a   polytheistic         theory   of

cosmotellurian creation, how can this be reconciled with what appears to

be a monotheistic view of a single deity, ɪluhina Ka'atuman. who is the cause

    and effect of all creation ? Perhaps an explanation is to be seen not

    so much in the strict dichotomy between monotheism and polytheism, but



  5A number of previous researchers into pre-literate communities have
warned that it should not suprise the modern botanist or biologist if
the categories of pre-literate communities such as the Abu' categories
of things do not square up with those of the biologists: (e.g. Bulmer,
1966; Adrianne Lang 1975). In pre-literate communities like the Kalam,
the Enga and the Abu' which do not have theories of evolution, the
categories emphasized in their system of folk-taxonomies are generally
different from those of the botanist or biologist and are determined
by either the geophysical features, such as the regions or areas in
which things are found, or are assigned according to particular
features of their life. This does not, as Bulmer (1966) pointed out,
make the pre-literate communities any less scientific than their
Western counterpart. After all, even Western communities, do not use
the 'Linnaean' method in all contexts when they want to talk about
things in the world. In most contexts, they use the common system of
ideas to categorize things.    In this respect the Abu' categories I
will present and discuss should be viewed from the Abu' point of view.
                                                                                             127


in the pervasive nature of spirit.                    In other words, Ka'atuman is the

ultimate pervasive masculine spirit, beyond and above all.                             The other

spirits are subordinate, yet no less powerful in the daily lives of

the Abu        people,      ɪluhina Ka1atuman assumes the core, the primacy of

the tree-branching Abu'            (apex of a pyramid by analogy)               folk taxonomy.

From     the     primacy      of      ɪluhina    Ka'atuman           ensue   three     principal

categories       which,      together     with        all    other    deities    and    entities,

constitute the. Abu' coswwspherc.            The three elements are iluh,              utaka and

itaf.

        The Abu'       know very little about               ɪluh and utaka.       Hence these

domains        are    not   important     to    the    Abu' •    Consequently    these become

terminal lexemes per se and so we cannot discuss them further.                               The

Abu', however, have simple knowledge of celestial bodies. The celestial

bodies important to the Abu' are those that they can see and which are

believed to have some influence over their lives.                            To the Abu' , the

celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and the stars appear to share

in common the feature [+animatel. To the Abu' these objects appear to

be   bodies which are self-mobile                and in         a way behave     like    animate

terrestrial creatures.

        The stars are all collectively seen as female things, even though

a group of them called nadikilakuh 'pointers' are regarded as males.

To the Abu'          stars are smaller but more beautiful to look at than the

moon, who is personified as a show-off male.                          The male image of the

moon is probably influenced by the Abu' folklore which regard the moon

as   some kind        of male      spirit.       In his      relationship with women, he

"kills", which signifies sexual assult or influence on women causing

them to menstruate. The moon is thus a deity whose influence on human

beings and on nature causes visible change. Women lose blood, days and

nights    are     light,      tides    change,    rains come          down and    winds    blow.

Regarding his influence on women to discharge blood, the Abu' use the

euphemistic expression:
                                                                                                          128


          4« aun   n-a-ha-'
             moon 3SGM-R-kill/hurt-3SGFU
            'The moon kills or hurts her'.

        Note that the moon aun is personified as a male who                                       kills or

hurts     (since 'to kill'             ha     expresses a number of English causative

verbs, such as          'hit , kill ,          hurt, injure,             assult) the woman (i.e.

the goal), thus causing her to discharge blood. Broadly speaking, the

moon     is the    actor and           women      are    the      goal    recipients and          by     this

implication are the wives of the moon.

        A question arises: why do Abu' portray the stars as females?                                       Is

it because the stars are normally small,                            sparkling and beautiful to

the naked eye and as such are like Abu' women or in a way reflect the

Abu'     general       image    of     women?           I    am    inclined        to     think    of     the

affirmative        response       to    the    second        question as a              poss'ibUity,      not

necessarily       the     reason.           As noted        in    chapter     3»    stars       uduwa are

assigned under the category 'female'                         (cf. class 2, chapt.3). I think

the Abu' might have been influenced by their general view of stars

being     female, and         hence     this      image      is              encapsulated          in     the

assignation       of    stars with          the    female         lexemes    under       the    same noun

class.

        Whereas iluh 'up and beyond'                    is less familiar to the Abu', itaf

'earth'       is more familiar.             The Abu' knowledge of it is verj                      devɑ'ded.

In     this    respect,     one    cannot         possibly detail            all    the       things     that

constitute it in a small section of a chapter of a thesis.                                          I will

thus be examining the prominent components only.


4.2.0.1 A few opening remarks on componential values

        Before analysing how the Abu'                       segment or categorize 'sublunary

things' itafisi, there are a few preliminary remarks that need to be

made     regarding      the    problems        the      author       faced    in        his    attempt    at

synthesizing the Abu' perceptions of itafɪsi and the complexity with

which they go about categorizing them. One of the problems I faced was
                                                                                             129

the choice of componential values or features when several feasible

alternatives are available.              Connected with this is the problem that

emerged when trying to justify the choices out of a number of equally

possible and acceptable alternatives.

       Consider,       for   example,     the        problem    of    choosing      componential

values        to     capture       the         Abu'         folk-taxonomy's          categories:

'heavenly/arboreal creatures' iluhisi; 'terrestrial creatures' itafisi

and    aquatic creatures'         walubisi.           These can all be represented in

several ways such as: a)            [+-heavenlyl or b) f+- terrestrial ] or c)

[+-aquatic\         The general principle to resolve cases such as these is

to adopt the ov^ta(i.e.                 more transparent features) categories or

features.      Categories or features that are important and intelligible

in    terms   of the      Abu'   system       of    ideas    about    their life and       their

world-view.        Hence, the above categories will merely be represented by

the overt categories thus: f+heavenly], [+terrestrial] and [+aquaticl

representing       the    Abu'   categories:            iluhisi,      itafisi    and   walubisi.,

respectively.            These   will    be        supplemented      with   other    additional

information for clarity where relevant.

       Knowledge of the concrete world itaf is 'often influenced by two

prominent      human      experiences,        namely     life     and   death.       These, two




  θlt has been observed elsewhere        (e.g. Bulmer 1969; Laycock,
1970; Lang 1975; Witkowski and Brown 1978; Chase and von Sturmer 1982
and Sutton 1982) that a number of prominent determinants appear to
form the basic universal constraints for non-scientific analysis of
how 'primitive' (i.e. non-scientific) communities of the world segment
or categorize the world to encapsulate their world-views.    Among the
prominent constraints suggested are: geography, folklore, ritualistic
beliefs (e.g. food taboo) physical attributes (i.e. of things such as
colour, shape, size and length).   These may in themselves constitute
the broader ethno-categories under which 'sublunary things' (itafisi)
are subsumed. This method of classifying itafisi is common not only
among Papua New Guinea communities but also among Australian
Aborigines (see Sutton, 1982 ed.) and other Pacific communities and I
believe among many world-communities that do not have modern theories
of evolution as observed by Bulmer (1969:7). The view presented there
is, in many respects, similar to the Abu' way of segmenting the
'earth' (itaf) and its constituents (itafisi).
                                                                                        130


experiences influence the way the Abu' perceive things.                        Some things

are considered in terms of the category [+animate],while other things

are covertly subsumed under the category [-animate].                        Relating these

dichotomies    to the world of things, the Abu' developed a linguistic

notion afita to reflect their dualistic                     view of human experiences.

Afita    must be    seen as    a cover        term for all those things that are

considered by the Abu' as [+animate] or are in some ways regarded to

have life and can respond when hit, struck, cut or touched. There is

no single word in the language that expresses the opposite feature

[-animate]    or insensate.         This     the Abu’       express by the attributive

clause     sakaka'i    'dead   things'.       The   immediate      Abu'     folk-taxonomic

branching of 'sublunary things' itafisi, is perceived                     in terms of the

feature [+animate1. Subsumed under the category [-animate] are things

like     stones,    soil,   and     water,     which    are     nevertheless     important

elements that the Abu'         rely on for growing food and nurturing growth

of all other things needed to subsist life. Consequently, the Abu' have
                                     V
developed a rich vocabulary to express different varieties of them,

thus indirectly suggesting what the Abu'                regard, in their world-view,

as significant.

       Water abal, for example, is a general term used by the Abu' to

include different types of water.             Thus 'rivers' are designated as

walubis; 'stagnant water' is called baiata; 'river pools' waas; 'rain'

is   referred to as asah which may be further described in terms of

whether it is a drizzle, torrential or slight.                  Drinkable water of all

kinds,    including beverages,          are collectively subsumed under the term

abal, but    with     modifying     (descriptive       or    attributive)     phrases   for

semantic    specificity.          For   example;    abal maduhibeli         'vine water’;

(abal muli<TP 'moli'        orange')       'orange water', abal bia          (<TP 'bia'))

'beer'    and so on. Coconut water is designated by a single lexeme —

numat. Water by the way is a powerful magic or sorcery 'cooler' and is
                                                                                                               131


used in many ways to fulfil the spiritual and secular needs of the

human person.

       Even though the Abu' recognize that water flows and fills space,

and that aquatic life walubisi breeds in it, and that it also becomes

the home       of    the    dead        (cf.4.2.2.21,           the    Abu'    cannot      determine           its

status.        ɪ     am    inclined          to     regard      water     as       non-living.          This

position       is     based       on     the      Abu'    belief        that       objects       like

stones     can       be    taken        as     somehow        animated        if    spirits       enter

them     and       thus    make        them       able   to     affect        activities         of men.

Clearly it can be seen that animation (if any), is an a posteriori

effect of some external (usually spiritual) cause and not an a priori

state of lifeless objects.

       To the Abu', rocks are formed from soils and not vice versa.                                        They

defend    this view by citing* several                        rock types           that they see being

formed. They say that slate stones are formed from clay type soil and

conglomerates are           formed from a mixture of pebbles and sticky soil

type that are. reined ty the hydraulic movement of water, especially tides.

Expanding on this,            John Naisoh expressed that reddish rocks sumaleb

are formed from itaf o'osifi 'reddish soil'; 'rocky soil'                                      (kein) forms

edim     'k.o.rock';          'chipped-rock-soil'                 (karawa)          is    said     to      form

dimis/si'embois            'slate-stone';                soft     bluish           soil    forms        ininuh

'mudstone'          and    finally           soft-sandy         soil    is     said       to   form      si'eh

'sandstone'.

       They also know which soils are rich in nutrients and which are

good for sorcery and magic making. Makuta 'dark soil' is highly valued

for cultivation and is essentially made up of a mixture of rock and

debris, while si'eh is highly prized as an ingredient in various forms

of magic.      Both soil and rock are regarded as lifeless, and thus they

rightly assume the feature [-animate].

       All other sublunary things that experience growth and mobility
                                                                                                      132


are     subsumed         under     the     category     afita.   Afita,        as   we   have       seen,

expresses the feature [+animate].                       It is only logical that the Abu'

                  between things that are fixed to a spot (expressed in Abu'

by the clause:

             5.    s     -a -k   -a -tawa   ate-tikin-i
                   3PIl<A-TRR-NPST-EV-stay  one-spot-LOC
                  'Things that are fixed to a spot1)

        and       things    that     are    self-mobile       sala    sekehi'i, which           I   will

categorize as [+locomotion!. I will now provide detail on things that

fall under this broad category.


4-2.1 Mobile things sala' sekehi'i

        Mobile things sala1              sekehi'i form a broad category that subsumes

such things as             (in this order of importance) human beings, spirits,

animals       and insects.          These categories of mobile                 creatures    seem       to

share the features [ +animate; +locomotion!, and contrast with those

that assume          the features [ +animate;               -locomotion!.           The latter are

realised by the taxa 'plants' lawas i madilih to be treated below.

        Returning           to      the        category      [+animate;        +locomotion!,           a

subcategorization is often observed between human beings and spirits,

on     the    one hand, and         animals      and    insects, on      the    other.     The       two

categories are distinguished by the feature [+ anthropomorphic^. Human

beings and spirits share the feature [+anthropomorphic! and animals

and insects the feature [-anthropomorphic!.                          The Abu', as communities

elsewhere, recognize that human beings are different from spirits, but

these dissimilarities are not often clearcut.                         Belief in spirits and

ghosts often entails the view that even though human beings die, they

are often said to experience virtually the same things as they did

when    they       were     alive.       For    example,      spirits     are       regarded

as     capable      of     eating,       capable       of   possessing     things, and they

are also believed to posses an excellent sense of perception.                                       This

.explains why the Abu' lay food and the deceased's valuables at the

graveside when the deceased is buried.
                                                                                          133


          One thing the Abu'        accept and strive to avoid or prevent from

happening is death. The dead are feared, and the Abu'                       recognize that

spirits belong to the category 'crossed the line people' sakaka'i and

live human beings belong to the category ’physically alive people'

sakafani.         On that basis it might seem logical to suggest that the

feature      [ + animate]     may be     proposed    to    separate human beings and

spirits; unfortunately, that solution is rather naive because it does

not take into account the spirits' ambivalent existence.

          Furthermore, if the feature T+human] is proposed to distinguish

human beings from spirits, we cannot aptly employ its binary feature

[-human]       to categorize spirits because the feature [-human] includes

other      non-human    creatures     and   things    as   well.      To     overcome    this

problem,      we need to add the feature [^-anthropomorphic]                   to separate

humans      and spirits      from creatures       and things, then the         division of

humans      and    spirits   into    [+-human1.      Having    done    that,     a   further

segmentation needs to be drawn to separate male lexemes from female

lexemes. These are realised by their respective terminal lexemes shown

in the appended taxonomic chart. Thus nouns which assume the features

[ + human; +male ] are realized terminally by the lexeme aleman 'man',

as opposed to numata'         'woman'.      Although male and female human lexemes

differ from the spirits'             terminal lexemes      ufu'al     'male    spirit'   and

ufu'elu’      'female spirit'        or female ghost maurenu'          and    'male ghost'

maurenina,        they all assume similar male or female preverbal markers

and subject themselves to similar syntactic rules of both masculine

and feminine genders (chapt.3).


4.2.1.1 [-Anthropomorphic] things

          Subsumed under the category [-anthropomorphic] are things such as

ɪɪɪahis     'animals'   alimikuh' 'birds';         akuh    'fish'     and     mahali'okulih

'insects'.        As a way of grouping these creatures into broad semantic

categories, the Abu' suffixed the three geographic categories namely;
walub 'water!, itaf land' and iluh 'air' or 'tree-top' with                                  Vo a.

plural    suffix      {-s}, to which             the attributive       particle       |-i}       must be

attached.        Thus       the     resultant          attributive     phrases       are      walubisi

'river-dwelling',           itafisi            or      bunohisi ’\and-clwe\\incj' and            iluhisi

'arboreal/air-bound things'.


4.2.1.2 Walubisi 'aquatic things'

       When     the    Abu'       use    the        descriptive     phrase       walubisi     'aquatic

things' , they do not only mean aquatic life. It is a cover term used

to include things that live in, near, or at the river banks or things

that have some association with water and the following three main

genera-------    (a) akuh         'fish';        (b)    dubaub     'crayfish';       (c) wele'esiwa

'river-crabs'         and     those other creatures such as alimikuh walubikuhi

'river        birds' (e.g.          bamin           'k.o.river bird'),           koi'owa walubiweri

'river        frogs' (e.g.          mofo''k.o.            edible    river    frog')        and    uukuh

walubikuhi 'river snakes'                (e.g.       dihihuru' 'k.o.river snake). The Abu'

also divide or distinguish members of the category walubisi by using

more   specific       features          like    sakasahi/sekefenisi          =    ['+-edible']        and

physiological         features, for             example,      didiwehisi/didiweh             aa'asi     =

['+-scales'ɜ.          These       features          are used      in dividing       creatures        and

things of almost all other recognizable taxa in the Abu' folk-taxonomy

usually    at the       lower      (i.e.        secondary or        tertiary)       level    than the

primary geographic features.


4.2.1.3 The taxon akuh 'fish'

       This taxon of aquatic life is segmented into the following major

terminal lexemes:             akuh 'river eels'; bahi'atas                   'perch'; and others

such as elmeten, kobuloh and bubin.                       These are varieties of fish found

in the rivers of the area that flow northward into the Bismarck Sea.

Those Abu'      rivers which flow into the tributaries that feed into the

Sepik River lack eels and crayfish but have other types of fish such
                                                                                                      135

4-2.1.4 dubaub 'crayfish'

      The    taxon       dubaub      'crayfish'        is   elided               into       four     main

varieties.      They are distinguished             from each other by the size and

colour of their scales. The biggest crayfish found in the rivers of

the   area is      called    waulakl.        A   term derived             from    the       verb waul-

 beckon     and the noun lakl 'hand'. Waulakl is thus a crayfish which is

seen to extend i*-        claws Chands' in Abu') in anticipation of grabbing

foodstuff    that    passes       its way.       The    term     waulakl         is    an excellent

example of how the Abu' have gone about coining a name for a creature

after its normal behaviour.


4.2.1.5 wele'esiwa walubiweri 'river crabs’

      The   taxon wele'esiwa          'crabs'     consists        of two         varieties namely

sa'ali'okulih and         wele'esiwa.     The     latter       is      chubby,        lustrous,      and

smoother than the former.             Both are edible.            In taste, the former is

luscious     and    is    therefore      preferable         to      the     latter,          which    is

traditionally regarded as 'female food'J


4.2.1.6 Other aquatic creatures

      Creatures      other    than    fish,      crayfish        and    crabs         are    sometimes

regarded aquatic but at other times are not. For example, dihihiru' is

sometimes seen to live under water, but at other times is seen on dry

aqueous ground and so it is described as a creature that assumes both

[♦-aquatic^ features.




   ^As mentioned earlier, the Abu1 is a partriarchal society and so male
members of the society are given more favourable treatment than women.
When it comes to food, for example, men are given or help themselves
to the better part of the meals, while the female usually takes the
less good. Poor food is not normally eaten by men. However, women who
 frequently do not get enough to eat from the main meals often find
themselves feeding on 'scrap' food.         This unfortunate practice
probably influences the Abu' to associate the eating of poor food as
being womanish.
   An opinion was expressed that some of the food taboos the Abu
observe were formed, and their continuity was encouraged, by selfish
male members of the society who do not want to share- certain
delicacies with their wives and children.
                                                                                       136


      The statue of things like mosquito larvae asakuh hakara abali,

and   'tadpoles'        barakasinab, literally., 'heads',      are   rather dubious.

Although the Abu'          recognise them as creatures that have their heads

sticking out of water, many Abu' are yet to learn or be convinced by

biologists or entomologists that larval forms                of these     creatures and

their respective adults are the same, differeing only in form at different

stages of growth. This lack of knowledge of the metamorphoses of these

creatures not only makes it hard for the Abu'                 to classify     them, but

also leods the Abu' to see both the larval forms and their respective

adults as unrelated.


4.2.2 bunohɪsi ’land dwelling creatures'

      The possessive clause bunohisi is used by the Abu'                     to broadly

subsume all the creatures that customarily dwell on dry ground or in

the   trees.      These    are   further    subcategorized    by another quantifier

itafisi 'non-arboreal' and non-aquatic' to further reduce the semantic

ambiguity.        Semantic       domains such as those derived from geographic

regions     are   not     always   easy    to determine.      Creatures     regarded   as

belonging to the category 'land-dwelling' may also subsume some of the

low flying birds. Although, the Abu' know quite well that some of the

low flying birds like sebiten 'k.o.bird' and sefila'uta 'k.o.bird' are

airbound,      because they usually fly at an altitude               of no    more than

about 15 metres (i.e. about the height of secondary growth of shrubs

or undergrowth),          they are regarded as       T-arboreall creatures.        This

difficulty of specifying the semantic domain illustrates the semantic

overlap present in many of the Abu' folk-taxonomy ethno-categories.

      The following taxa constitute what the Abu' see as belonging to

the category 'land-dwelling'              itafisi; (a) mahis 'game';8 (b) alimikuh

'birds';    (c) uukuh 'snakes';           (d) wahikes 'lizards’; and the following




■ 8The term mahis is broadly used to mean animal                 bird, fish, lizard,
snake, etc. flesh as food.
                                                                                             I
                                                                                                   137

(g)     asi'afuwa          'spiders';         (h)     uribikabif        'dragon        flies';     (i)

ihiaburilih         'butterflies';          (j)    kelmu'is 'grasshoppers';             (k) titiakas

akiakas       'ants';      (o)    mahali*okulih,         'small     flying insects',        such    as

sunflies, fireflies, gnats and so on), and finally asakuh 'tree grubs'

(including all kinds of hylophagous grubs)                          and 'maggots'. Some tree

grubs are edible and are classified as edible mahis 'meat'.                                The same

applies to alhu'abis 'eggs'.

        The   category of itafisi                 'land-dwelling creatures'            listed above

is segmented further down to families at the sub-order level and these are

realized      by whatever           respective       terminal      lexemes the     Abu'    speakers

have traditionally known them by.                     The adoption of physical attributes

(e.g.     sex,      colour,      shape,     lustre     and   texture)     to    provide semantic

contrasts among the taxa of insect                       and animal       life is       also fairly

common.       However,      it   was fairly problematic              trying to ascertain the

Abu'    entomological         and    zoological        knowledge.       Consequently,      detailed

information is unavailable for further analysis.


4.2.2.1 ɪluhisi 'arboreal or airbound creatures'

        Creatures         that    the     Abu'      categorize     as   iluhisi     'arboreal       or

air-bound'          are    represented        by     certain members       of    the     species    of

animals       and    avifauna       which     have     already been       presented       under    the

category       itafisi      'land-dwelling'.             These     include      mahis    'animals';

alimikuh 'birds'; uukuh 'snakes' and wahikes 'lizards'.                                 The Abu'    do

not see snakes and lizards as belonging to                           the same category.           They

have no term in the language that approximates the biologist's term

'reptiles'.
                                                                                       138


4«2.2.2 mahia iluhiai 'arboreal animals'

     The     category      mahia    iluhiai   'arboreal    animala*        comprises   the

following species:          (i) ehinab 'tree-kangaroo';        (ii) iluhis 'cuacua';

and (iii) ihawanab 'k.o.edible arboreal rats'.


4•2.2.3 alimikuh iluhikuhi 'arboreal avifauna'

         Birdlife of the area is so plentiful that adequate scientific

 knowledge is far from satisfactory, and so I will only be concerned

 with the illustration of the major species and how the Abu' attempt to

 classify them.

         The Abu' distinguish members of individual avifaunal species by

 the use of classificatory labels such as sowohuni and numa'ini, 'male'

versus    'female', and     their use of physical features such as colour,

feathers, beaks, or the size, shape and length of tails to specify and

distinguish      birds.          Furthermore, the   way Abu'      see    individual bird

species    may    also      be     influenced by    folklore   or       cultural   motifs.

Hornbills are regarded as males, husbands of the cassowary. According

to a myth, the cassowary was once an arboreal bird. One day it fell of a

tree and broke its          wings. Because of this incident it swapped places

with its husband,         the hornbill, which was terrestrial. Since that time

the cassowary has become a land-dwelling creature and the hornbill an

arboreal creature. Hornbills are also an effigy                of the kwal(< Abelam

ngwal 'ancestral spirit’’. Probably for this reason, it is regarded a

taboo food. Many Abu' people,             especially children and women            (and in

particular,      women of child bearing age) would weaken themselves if

this bird food was eaten.

     Birds of paradise are regarded as female and, in this respect,

beautiful women are          figuratively referred        to as     amulawa 'birds-of-

paradise'.

     The harpy eagle amun is edible, but many Abu' people do not eat it

because they fear that it might debilitate them or make them sick.
                                                                           159

Certain parts (claws,      feathers etc.)   of the eagle are used by some

Abu   men in rituals and it is qTFHe ^possible that because of its use

in rituals, some Abu' people avoid eating it.


4.2.2.4 uukuh iluhikuhi 'arboreal snakes'

      Two arboreal pythons are found in the area and are edible.           The

brown and green          a«e named dibiah and abunal^respectively.


4.2.2.5 wahikes iluhikesi 'arboreal lizards'

      Arboreal lizards are realized by terminal lexemes.      There are

a great variety of them.      The three prominent species of arboreal

lizards are usakina 'k.o. monitor lizard'; wahiko1 'striped gecko';

and amekaren 'small green lizard'.      These are all important to the Abu'

because they are edible.      There have been reports of periodic

observations of a green poisonous monitor(?) lizard.       It is said to

live up an umbrella-shaped tree called beritef, from which the lizard

gets its name.

      We have observed in the preceding pages how the Abu'       talk about

and categorize mobile creatures found in the area. The creatures are

subsumed under afita, a concept that approximates the English notion

of    [+living[.    It    encompasses   two   taxonomic   domains,   namely,

[+locomotion] which we have looked at and [-locomotion] to which we

shall now turn.


4.2.3 Sakatawa atatekeni 'things lacking locomotion'

      The ethno-category [-locomotion] is adopted to refer particularly

to the vegetation lawas i madilih of the area. The vegetation belongs
                                    ɑ
to the tropical rainforest zone.




  θwith virtually no      background training in botany, let alone
ethnobotonical procedure     for data collection and collation, my
presentations will be based on general layman's knowledge from the
Abu' standpoint. Consequently,it was considered futile to try to draw
any comparative remarks between the Abu' and the botanist's systems of
knowledge on ethnobotany.
                                                                                                          140


        Before I examine the elements of the category [-locomotion],                                        I

wish    to       acknowledge        that    in    a    recently published article                   titled:

"Anthropology         and     Botany:Turning Over               a     New     Leaf";      Chase    and   von

Sturmer          (1982)     re-echoed       the       value    that     research          and   subsequent

knowledge on "pre-scientific and/or pre-literate" communities of the

world     may                        contribute         towards        the        field    of     cognitive

anthropology. A well informed knowledge of "ethno-categories", the two

authors observed, might help an outsider who studies another culture

gain some, insights into the cognitive sʌrueʌores                             of the culture he/she

is studying. We are not dealing with                                cognitive                     here.,but

we      nonetheless,..         are         fairly       interested            in     these        authors1

systematization of the ethno-categories of the Aboriginal communities

of Cape York Peninsula for the insights these offer in our analysis of

Abu'     ethno-botanic             categories.           The     two    authors           concluded      that

botanical knowledge of the Aborigines is characterized mainly by:                                         (1)

environmental             zonation;    (2)       cross-domain         terminology where            a given

lexical entry can be used to classify different things that speech
           r
community see as sharing      common certain attributes; and (3)

'mate-relationship'. The Abu'                    categorize flora of the .-area according

to a number of "ethno-categories" that are virtually similar to those

the- Aborigines use. The Abu' categorize the flora of the area into a

number       of    overt     categories.            These      are:         (1)    land    zonation;      (2)

male-female relationship; .(3) mate-relationship and                                   (4) numerational

relationship.              These    Abu'     categories will now be examined                       in more

detail.      .


4 .’2.3 • V 'Land Zonation

        The Abu'      recognize three-land zones according to which trees or

plants may be classified.                   These are          (a) wabulisi            domicile plants ɪ,

(b) ana’atakwisi 'plants of the zone adjoining the domicile zone’., and

(e) ar'atakwisi 'forest plants'.
                                                                                 141


        a. wabulisi 'village plants’

        The . domain of village plants wabulisi includes both
        cultivated and non-cultivated plants which normally grow
        near the region within the village area, or near the region
        of human settlement. These plants are either useful or not
        useful to humans. Edible fruit-bearing trees such as
        coconuts, betel-palms (Areca palms) and breadfruit trees
        helukih are examples of what the Abu’ regard as members of
        the domain wabulisi.

           ana'atakwisi 'plants of the zone adjoining the village
        zone'

        Ana'atakwisi is approximated to the English — 'plants of
        fallow land'. The word ana'atakw denotes 'fallow land' on
        which grow soft wooded trees such as eribikes 'fern-trees',
        wild-bananas uritok, umbrella-shaped trees beritef, and so
        on.

        c. ar'atakwisi 'non-gardening forest plants'

        Uncultivated plants are described as belonging to the region
        of 'uncultivated land' ar'atakw. The Abu' use the derived
        possessive clause:

               ar'atakw           -i -s   -i
               hard-forast-land   -EV-3PLN-GEN
              'hard-forest-land things'

        to categorize trees, vines, and undergrowth that typically
        grow in the ara'atakw 'forest-land'.  This area of land is
        usually not cultivated to allow less interference with the
        animal life. In this land zone the Abu' hunt wild game
        and obtain their herbal medicine.


        2. Male-female relationship 'sowohini e numa'ini'

        Plants may also be classified or identified in terms of being 'a

male'    sowohini or     'a female'    nuɪɪia'ini. These terms are used only in

reference to animals and plants.             The basis for dividing animals and

plants are determined by sex            (in the case of animals)      and physical

appearance in the case of plants.            Plants (or parts of plants, e.g.

leaves,     stalks,   trunks,     barks, etc.)   exhibiting male characteristics

(e.g.     slenderness,    tall,    fuzzy )   are   subsumed   under   the   category

sowohuni and those exhibiting the opposite features (i.e.thick, short,

smooth) are subsumed under numa'ini, but they do not necessarily take

on male or female class marking.

        ʒ. Mate-relationship 'esis etis’
                                                                                                     142


        The Abu' also talk about plants in terms of one being a mate to

another and this is expressed by the phrase;

                esis et-i-s
                3PL one-GEN-3PL0bj
               'They are one-and-the same things'

        a     general     declarative       statement       that       suggests the          idea     of

belonging to the same species or order.

        4. Enumerational relationship

        The Abu' have in recent times                  become accustomed to the use of

Tok     Pisin     sequential        enumeration        to   express          phylic     or    generic

relationship of things. On numerous occasions, the Abu' used the Tok

Pisin derived enumerational categories as nambawan kwila                                'number one

hard-wood       tree'     [Afzela bijuga], nabatu kwila                'number        two hard-wood

tree', and namba tri kwila 'number-three hard-wood tree'.                                An obvious

explanation that can be give^fas to why this method is used has to do with

the fact that Tok Pisin is lexically deficient in this regard whereas

the Abu' naming is better. Hence Abu'                   is equipped lexically to provide

with precise terms things found in the world, especially within the

Abu'    language frontier.          Consequently the three species of hard-wood

trees are realized in Abu1                 by   independent terminal               lexemes, namely,

wamuta, nubulaf and nɪaluh.

        Incidentally,       this    recent      adoption     of    naming          things    into    an

enumerational           relationship       is   also    used      by    the     Abu'     when       they

categorize animals into species at the secondary or tertiary level and

one     might     conjecture        that    this      technique        is     probably       used    by

communities       whose     languages       lack   overt    terms       to    designate       obvious

phylic, generic, or order relationship of animals and plants.

        The    above being     the salient         (in Chase       & von Sturmer's terms)

"ethno-categories", the Abu', when pressed to provide specific details

of member lexemes of plants, resort to what Sutton (1982:303) referred

to     as   "attributional         classes"     for    drawing     out       and    distinguishing
                                                                                                  143


minute details about plants* The attributional classes synthesized by

Sutton       (             )   in his study of Cape York Aboriginal communities'

linguistic aspects of ethnobotany are (1) stages of growth ;                                (2) plant

part                 and       (ʒ)     attributes        (i.e.          descriptive/adjectival

descriptions).             Some of these are similar to those used by the Abu'

community.

       The following salient attributional classes are used by the Abu'

for the purpose of plant                   assortment at the generic or family levels:-

(1)    use       ;   (2) attributional components and                  (3)   edibility vis-a-vis

inedibility. Let me discuss and illustrate these in detail.


4«2.3»2 The use of plants sueisi sakada'asi

       Plants (in particular,uncultivated ones), are usually categorized

in terms of the fairly covert category of use and this the Abu' express

by the use of the clause:

       s-a-k-da'a-s    uma
       3PLA-R-NPST-to make-3PL0bj for
       'they use them for...(job X)'.

       Reference is made to this manner of identifying things, if the

inquirer wishes to be informed on what a specific thing is used for.


4.2.3.3 Attributional components

       Attributional             components       or    values   are     a   series    of    nominal

descriptive          phrases         the   Abu'   use   for   the   purpose     of    apportioning

natural phenomena.              The main attributes the Abu’                 use to classify or

categorize plants are (a) colour, (b) dimensional components, such

as height, length, size, shape, and (c) other minor attributional

class distinctions, such as fuzzy, brittle, rough, smooth and so on.
                                                                                                144


4«2.3«4 Colour

        Colour is a prominent lexical domain used by the Abu'                               for the

purpose of distinguishing one thing from another, especially if those

things talked about have common                                        attributes.        Among the

colour lexical domains               the colours frequently used are ou'es which

means a range of colours ranging from 'red, tan,                          (light)     'brown' and

asu'    'green, dark brown'. Broadly speaking, the world to the Abu'                             is

dichotomized into red and green,which perhaps reflects the environment

the Abu' encounter everyday.               Use of other colour categories is less

frequent because they are less prominent in the Abu' world.


4.2.ʒ.5 Edibility sakasahi

        Plants   are    broadly       divided        into     those    whose    leaves,     stocks,

roots,    or tubers are edible            (f+ediblel) sakasahi and those that are

inedible ([-edible]) sekefenisi. Detailed ethnobotanical knowledge on

the plants belonging to the latter category was difficult to get from

informants,who provided some knowledge mainly about edible plants.

        Edible   plants       belong      to     two     subcategories,         cultivated      and

uncultivated, and           indications        are     that    both categories        are    evenly

distributed.        Cultivated plants comprise fruit-bearing trees, such as

ahawa    'coconuts'         (Cocos   nuciferus)         and    edible     gorcievx          plants.

The uncultivated plants include numerous trees or vines with edible

leaves and/or fruit, such as akuf 'k.o.tree'                          (with edible leaves and

fruit)     and ber'esinaleh 'k.o. vine'                 (with edible leaves) .             The main

division of cultivated plants are the food crops we'isi. which will be

described in the following pages.

        Knowledge      of    we'isi     'foodstuff'           among     the    Abu'   is     fairly

extensive and is very important for its obvious beneficiary effect of

sustaining life as well as                for its socio-economic               importance.      The

emphasis on the socio-economic value of foodstuffs probably induced

the Abu’ to develop a fairly elaborate way of talking about them and

remembering them.                                                                                     I
                                                                                                     145


        Yams,      for    example,     form      the major          component of Abu'           cultural

exchanges         and subsequent           redistribution among members of                     the feast

partners referred to in Abu' as the buanim.                               The only way to win in

this    kind       of     competition       is   to    outscore          the   rival    feast    partner

through       a    display     of many good           yams,       pigs     and      other   traditional

wealth. During such events both partners become heavily involved in an

excercise of keeping a mental record of the quality and quantity of

yams,    other food-crops,            pigs       and other forms of traditional wealth

(e.g.     nabalukuhuwa 'rings’. and kahies 'shells') displayed by the rival

feast partner. This is to enable the recipients to try and give better

food and wealth in subsequent food exchanges(cf. chapt.5).

        The       high    demand      on     Abu'     men    to     keep       an   accurate

record        of yams      probably         explains    why        the     Abu'     have

developed          such    a   rich        knowledge        of    this     garden      crop.    In

what follows, I will list and describe the main types of crops the

Abu' grow in their gardens. The order in which they are listed broadly

reflects          their     sociocultural           significance.              This    order    is   not

necessarily maintained in the folk-taxonomy appendix.


4.2.5.6 Wa'wis 'yams’              (Dioscorea sppʃ)



        Sa'uan      and     Nekitel        (my   father)         cited    as   many as      seventy-two

varieties of yams. Many of them constitute terminal taxa (cf. Appendi^

  whereas in English, they are collectively referred to by the generic

term 'yams'. The terminal taxa of yams are named or categorized by:­


   - a) physical attributes (e.g. long versus short yams, red
     versus white    and yellow yams; round versus flat yams,
     straight versus spiral yams.)

   - b) naming them after the shape of things. For example, a
     spiral yam which looks like a snake is called uul 'snake
     yam*.

   - c) naming or identifying yams after the places from which
     the Abu' got them.
                                                                                   146


       These ways of identifying or classifying yams are. also used when

the Abu' talk about other foodstuffs.


4.2.3.7 Nikef (TP taro) (Colocasia esculenta spp.)

       Taro nikef comprise two types: nikef kenekesif 'native taro' and

nikef koukou        (Colocasia esculenta),   the variety which is named from

the    Tok Pisin word kongkong      'Chinese'    (<Hong Kong). The        Abu'    also

distinguish different varieties of taro by the colour of the leaves or

tubers.


4.2.3«8 Ufas 'bananas'       (Musa spp.)

       Bananas are classified      in the same way as yams and taro.               The

Abu' have identified about 32 varieties of bananas. About half a dozen

of them were reported to have been introduced -to ʌhe                           sodʌ far

away places as Kavieng,' Manus and Lemieng village near Aitape.


4.2.3.9 Buhunab 'sugarcane'       (Saccharum spp, especially Saccharum

          officinarum)

       There are 17 main varieties of sugarcane which the Abu' identify

and distinguish virtually on the bases of physiological attributes or

are    named   after natural    phenomena    because   of their    resemblance to

sugarcane.      For example, abelin is derived from abal 'water' because

of its high juice content and lawakin is derived from lawak 'tree' to

indicate its hard skin when chewed.


4.2.3.10 Wesif (TP pitpit, Saccharum spp.)                                  `

       There are as many as 14 varieties of wesif (Saccharum spp.), a

kind of plant with edible top (cf. Mihalic, 1971 :156). The method the

Abu'    use    in     differentiating   wesif   is     same   as   that    used     in

differentiating bananas or yams.
                                                                                           147


4.2.3.11 Fufayahes (TP popo) (Carica papaya)

        There are two varieties of pawpaws,            long ones and short ones.

Long ones are seen as masculine sowohusiwhile the shorter or rounder

ones     are   regarded    as   feminine    and     hence   are   termed'    numa1isi.

Sometimes long pawpaws are seen as mates of water melons because they

look like red water melons when cut open.


4.2.3.12 Sul'if 'Zea mays'

        Maize consists of five varieties, namely, udukuh, midilib,

utakabul, dakua, and sosaiti kon.            The name dakua is derived from

Dagua, the village from which the Abu' got this corn variety.


4.2.3.13 Mahas i mehiawa 'Cucurbit vines'

        There are five varieties of cucurbit          vines. Indigenous ones are

named     mahas    'k.o.   cucumbers'      and    include   the   following      species

wautas,    maris     and efefin. The pumpkin weuhana and cucumbers mehiawa

were introduced after contact.


4.2.3^14 A'wal 'edible greens'

        Sa'uan classified a'wal into five varieties.              Four of them are

realized by terminal taxa.         These are       unakw 'pumpkin leaves', a'wal

'native spinach'       (Aramanthus gangeticus) and wahuwa 'native cabbage'.

The fifth one is made up of a variety of nalibowa (TP abika) 'Hibiscus

manihot' , a tree with edible leaves and top.               Nalibowa is made up of

eight varieties and these are distinguished from one another virtually

by physical attributes.         Pumpkins and many of the Hibiscus manihot are

introduced into the area.

        Although the folk-taxonomic analysis of the ethno-categories used

by the Abu'       are by no means comprehensive, what has been presented

seems to underscore the way in which the Abu' categorize information

about the plant life of the area.                 This undoubtedly     reflects how

their world-view is shaped by the environment with which the Abu' are

familiar, and the language categorizes information it finds significant

from the perspective of the native speaker-hearer.                      ............ ............
                                                                                             148


        In relating Abu'        ethno-categories to those of the other PNG or

Aboriginal       communities,      the        general   pattern   that emerges        from the

description of the Abu'                system of ideas regarding categorization of

things is            s'(wutar                 to previous findings (cf.          e.g.,    Bulmer

1969; Laycock 1970; Lang 1975; Farb 1974; Chase and von Sturmer 1982

and Sutton 1982 ed.). It seems possible that some generalisations can

be posited in terms of an areal typology of ethno-categories typically

shared by communities in this region of the world.



4«5 The interrelationship, if any, of the Abu' world-view and noun

       class system

        Up to now, I have described the Abu' world-view and outlined the

community's       folk-taxonomy                          to provide     the basis        for the

remarks that I will make about the underlying -fɑeʌoes                        assumed to play

a role in the determination of the noun classes. The position that has

hitherto      been    adopted      is     that     phonology      is   the    major      feature

determining the classification of nouns in the various noun classes

(       e.g. Nekitel 1977). What we are not too sure of is whether or not

some of these classes are determined by semantics,

the    Abu’   world-view as portrayed              in the   community's folk-taxonomy.

Therefore,       the rest     of the      chapter will       re-examine the       noun class

system    (cf.    chapt.3, p. 65) and will              try especially to find out if

there are semantic principles underlying the Abu'                        categorization of

things into the different noun classes the language has.

       Although it is not possible to specify all the factors that might

have    influenced      the     Abu'     to    categorize    nouns     into    classes,     some

general remarks can be made. These are discussed below. The numbering

of the noun classes are arbitrarily made up to facilitate reference.

Classes 1 and 2 will be discussed together. The rest of the classes

will be discussed individually.
                                                                                                   149


4.3.0.1 Classes 1 and 2

        Class one subsumes both loanwords (e.g.                     TP pater 'priest', dokta

 doctor , tisa (<TP tisa) 'male ' teacher','ɑod', Yesus 'Jesus', Spiritu

Santu     'Holy   Spirit',        Angelo        'Angel')     and    indigenous      words       (e.g.

Nailiah, Nekitel, So'osin (all male human names), Ka'atuman 'creative

deity' from above, Ufu'al ɪmara 'spirit lmara', mauran 'ghost') humans

and   spirits     that    are     or    thought       of as    belonging       to   the     category

r+male].      Member     lexemes       of     this    category,     although they differ in

their endings, are ɜroopwl together by the fact that they assume the

same singular and plural cross reference markers, namely, {n}                                  and {m},

which function as preverbal markers in verb phrases (VPs) and nominal

(male)     concord affixes         in noun phrases (NPs)              and in        the objective

slots in clauses. .

        The   same     can   be        said     of     all    the   loan   (e.g.          TP     sista

'sister/nun',        tisa 'female teacher', dokta 'female doctor', TP Santu

Maria     'Saint Mary', Santu Katarina 'Saint Catherine') and indigenous

(e.g.      Awo'an,     Kundiwata,           (all female      personal names)        and ufu'elu'

Bafiteis      '(female spirit)           Bafita',       maurenu'     'female    ghost')         female

human and spirit nouns.            Although they differ phonologically, they

are classified together by the cross referencing female gender

affix — {kW-}.           It might be queried why nouns imply masculine

and feminine genders in their meanings subsume the categories [+male]

and [+female] and are subsequently subject to the rules of grammar that

govern both genders.            An obvious and probably the most plausible reason

is that both classes are marked.                     Consequently,     a   noun      that

implies a masculine or a feminine gender in its meaning assumes

whichever the appropriate morphological elements (NCE) that signal

its membership to one or the other of the classes (irrespective of

their phonological shape).                  Furthermore, since the Abu' world-view draws
                                                                                        150


no sharp dichotomy between the human and the spirit worlds, and that

the   human    and   the    spirit    belong,    as    it    were,     to   the    category

['•♦•anthropomorphic"' , it is highly likely that this view is encapsulated

in the Abu' language structure.

      The assignment of nouns such as                 the 'cassowary' unaru' to the

female class is'rather precarious as regards underlying motive(s). Its

inclusion under the         female class       and its      adoption of     the feminine

gender   cross     reference      marker might have         been motivated        either by

phonology,    or by reasons derived from the Abu' folklore that regard

the cassowary as belonging to the category femalejɑ

      Let us not overlook the fact that some of the nouns assigned to

class two that do not seem to reflect any clearly defined semantic

domain are probably determined by phonology. The                     'puli' of the noun

terminal     ɛ']   must    have    been   in   operation.     Consider      the    examples

presented in the following table.

   I^The cassowary, according to a myth, is a female which lives under
the guise of cassowary 'feathers' ahuwalub. A myth has it that one day
a bachelor went hunting and, coming to a river pool, heard some noises
coming from the opposite direction. He immediately climbed a tree and
hid himself, and lo and behold, there was a group of cassowaries making
their way to the pool.      On arriving they sloughed their skins and
turned into beautiful women and started swimming. The man had a good
look at them and chose the most beautiful among them and told an ant
to go and fetch her skin and take it up to him. As soon as he got the
skin from the ant, he hid it.
   Having done that, he distracted them by throwing a couple of fruits
from that tree into the centre of the pool. When the cassowary women
sensed that there was a person around, they got out of the pool,
adorned their cassowary skins and made for the forest leaving behind
the most beautiful one. Realising that her cassowary skin was missing,
the abandoned cassowary woman started crying. In the meantime the real
man ascended from the tree and took her home to be his wife. After
some time she with the aid of the eldest child found her skin, wore it
and turned back into a cassowary and fled to join her own kind in the
forest. Since then cassowaries are always seen as females.      Similar
versions were also recorded of the Muhiang by Laycock 1975, and Buki
by Narakobi 1979, and Kalam (Bulmer, 1965) and also the latɪnul and
Abelam.

4.3.1 Noun Class 3-10

       Regarding the rest of the noun classes                (viz. 3-10),       these are

determined    principally      by    phonology    and   I    noticed    only    a   slight

semantic pattern developing in some of them. Their assignm«v<t                           to

their respective noun classes might, therefore, be attributed to both

phonology and semantics, thus reflecting, as it were, the influence of

the Abu' world-view on the community's language.

       I will first describe the class that contain nouns that seem to

me to associate themselves with alahuta 'home'                or 'village' and whose

grouping I thought might have been influenced by such a view.


4.3-1.1 Class 3

       Nouns assuming the singular affix _t and the plural marker kw- are

grouped under this class.           There is evidence to suggest that many of

the   nouns may well      be   represented       taxonomically under        the feature

r+domicile^ and thus suggest a direct or indirect semantic connection

of    referents   with   the   "sememe”    (Crystal,        1980:317)    |_t]   which   is

derived from the semantic domain alahuta 'home, 'village', 'homestead'

or 'camp'. Consider for example:


29-   nubat >nubakw    'dog'
50.   awata >awatakw 'hen, 'rooster' or 'chicken'
51.   abita >abitokw 'rat', 'mouse'
52.   sibu'ata >sibu'atakw) 'k.o.brownish bird' (usually domicile)
55.   kwafita>kwasitokw 'spoon'
34.   selita > selitokw 'masher'
35-   berita > beritokw 'bed', 'scaffold'
36.   wamuta > wamutokw 'slitgong; 'hard-wood tree' (Afzela biɔuga)
                         (from which slit-gong is made)
                                                                                         152


37. biri'ita> biri'itokw 'wedge'
38. al'ata >al'atakw    'piece of burnt wood'
39« dal ata>dal'atokw 'end part of food items' (e.g. yams, sugarcane)

40.     uta>utokw 'door'
41 .    kul'uta >kul'utokw 'male bag' (made out of dark-palm sheat)
42.     bata > batakw 'bamboo'
43.     akata> akatokw 'backbone', 'midrib' (of coconut leaf/tobacco )
                        or 'sago frond'
44.     du'it>disukw 'small hili'(where village sites are a commonplace)
45.     barata>baratakw 'corpse'
46.     walbata          'name of a village'
47.     abalukinamatn    'name of a Womsis hamlet'
48.     ihata>ihatokw    'sago swamp' (homesteads are usually made there
                           for easy access to sago making)
49-     ihat>ihatokw     'taste' (of food which is usually eaten at home)

         In addition to        these, ihece aret<w«. noons which assume        ft)    as the

preverbal marker but do not appear to have any semantic connection

with 'home'. For example;

        50. kwal'iata>kwal'iatakw 'black cockatoo',
        51 • baiata>baitokw       'stagnant water'
        52. urita>uritokw         'wild banana'


4.3.1.2 Class 4

         Subsumed under this class are nouns whose sin^ɪlar form terminate

in j-m^ and plural in I -1 i and these NCEs seem to bind together many

of the nouns that seem to share the attributional class !"+round\                        The

concept      'round'    means a number of shapes to              the Abu'.    It may,    for

example,      mean     'oval   shape,       round,   spherical   or   round   edge.      The

following list provides evidence of this class.

        There are aome nouns which are            assigned      the claaa but which

do      not   seem   to   have    any     overt   semantic   association   with   the

dimensional attribute [♦round"’. For example,


 72.        natam>natakuh               'digging stick' (could well be grouped
                                          under above if it is considered as a
                                          tool used in digging round yam holes)

4.3.1.3 Class 5

        Nouns whose singular form end in lɔbut which assume the nominal

concord element _b (being the "hard" consonant)              for both singular and

plural marker are grouped           together under this class.       The plural of

this class is        formed    by a metathesis of the final syllable         of the

singular,as the following examples show:


 76.    nubul > nulub    ’belly, intestine’
 77.    afurubul>afurulub'mouth droplets'
 78.    dokubul>dokulub  'pimple'
 79.    numabul>numalub  'thin twisted string for making netbags'

 81 .   nahabul>nahalnb  'fibrous root' (from a certain kind of plant,
                          which when dried has a strong smell and can
                          be used in magic or for curing diseases)
 82. nahubul>nahulub     'yam fibre’
 83. akabul>akalub       'coconut frond'
 84. atabul>atalub       'girder'
 85. dabul>dalub         'fence' (c. 140cm high, usually built

                          wrapping food)
 88. nukesibul>nukesilub 'twisted Rastafarian hair style'
 89. ar'ubul > ar'ulub   'midrib of sago-palm leaf'
 90. ahurabul>ahuralub   'peeled banana skin' (slang for ’penis')

        It appears that the above set of nouns are dɑssifiutogether or seem
                                                                                                         154


to share in common the feature 'length or slimness'                                   and,      in a way,

suggest the Abu'                physical view of these things.                     Whether the actual

grouping of nouns under the class wɑs determined on that basis alone

is a question that we cannot very well answer. I think, the feature

the nouns seem to reflect must have probably played a role. What we

might    suggest           is    that    the         Abu'    could   have    been guided         by    their

               empirical          observations when             categorizing         nouns,     as     those

listed.above by deriving their words by way of semantic associations

with    the     features,          such as,            r+slimness/length\           that   capture       the

physically observable shape of things they encountered in the world.

That being established, other nouns which do not appear to have any

semantic connections with the feature T+slimness, lengthɔ are included

under the class virtually determined by the phonological "pull" of the

last "hard" consonant {bj• For example:


 91•    wabul > walub              'village, country, nation'
 92.    asubul>asulub              'folk-dance'
 95«    dokubil>dokulib            'black-head pimple'
 94-    ar'ubul>ar'ulub            'k.o. hard sedimentary rock'


        The above classes seem to be ijɪie only classes that I think have

something of a semantic basis.                          The following noun classes, however,

are not. They can, therefore, be described as a mixed bag.                                       As such,

they are made up of member lexemes which do not appear to share much

in the way of semantic                   features and,           therefore,        serve as excellent

cases in which their assignment is basically determined by phonology.

Let us consider some examples of the remaining noun classes.


4.3.I.4 Class 6

        Nouns whose singular noun terminal is                                and         plural form is

js)}    which     in        turn    become            the     preverbal      subject       markers      and

,eoreferential suffixes in NPs and VPs, are grouped under this class.
                       ,                        -k


Subsumed under this class also afe nouns that imply plurality.                                         Such

nouns    are     signalled          by    the         noun   terminal       {s}, which     is   a     fairly
                                                                                  155


consistent     plural     morpheme.    Some     examples   are   listed   below   for

illustrative purposes:

 120.     rais [<TP raisl     'rice'
 121 .    kris [<TP grisɔ     'fat, oil’



4.3.1.5 Class 7

         Nouns which assume the singular verbal prefix i_k} and the plural

|s| are grouped under this class. Although some member lexemes appear

to suggest that they have something to do with 'eating', there is so

much variance      that    the   pattern   is   not   sustainable.    Consider    the

following set of examples:

  122.      ahaka>ahakas        'tongue'
  123.      amaka>amakas        'face'
  124.      baraka>barakas      'head'

  126.      afinika>afinikas    'saliva' (formed in anticipation

  132.      kal'anaka>kal’anakas 'sand'
  133•      uhaka>uhakas          'stump, root of one's origin'
  134.      waak>waas             'river pool'
                                                                            156


  135«     numuneka>numunekas       'shame, embarrassment'


4.3.1.6 Class 8

        Nouns whose singular form end in {1J       and the plural form in

and which subsequently occur in the cross reference marker slot in a

clause    or a   nominal modifier     phrase are grouped under      this class.

There are no signs of these nouns being assigned to the class on the

basis of semantics. They are all determined by phonology. Examples of

nouns of this class include such nouns as:

  136.     abal>abakuh          'shadow, soul'
  137.     aful >afukuh         'vulva'
  138.     aul >akuh            'fish', mosquito
  139-     usibel               'blood'
  140.     alimil>alimikuh      'bird' (generic)
  141.     bul    >burkuh       'pig'
  142.     abunal>abunakuh      'green python'
  143.     uul>uukuh            'snake'
  144      ihial>ihiakuh        'flying fox'


4.3.1.7 Class 9

        Nouns assigned under this class assume the preverbal marker {h|

for both singular and plural. Some examples.

 145.     uluh>ululih           'fig tree'
 146.     bur'ah>bur'aleh       'leg, foot, footprint'
 147.     laah>laaleh           'k.0.daggers' (made from cassowary's

 148.     ihiaburuh>ihiaburulih 'butterfly'
 149.     nubah>nubaleh         'root' (of a tree)
 150.     aluh>alulih           'triton, conchshell'
 151.     ulah>ulalih        *  'post'
 152.     su(h)>sulih r<TP suɜ 'shoe'


4.3.1.8 Class 10

        This class is made up of nouns which terminate their singular in

{11}    and their   plural in    -(kw)v(e,i,u)h,   As   can be   seen from the

 examples below, they do not seem to have any semantic commonality.

 They are grouped according to the "pull" of the last hard consonant

 and, therefore, are determined by phonology.           Some examples:




   153. iah>iakwih           'road, footpath'
   154. dumah>dumakwih       'monitor lizard'
  155.   lahuh>lahulih              ’sago palm'
  156.   haleh>halekwih             'breadfruit tree' (Artocarpus communis)
  157.   waluh>walukuih             'fog,mist'
  158.   lufah>lufokwih             'calico'
  159.   uwah>uwakwih               'sunshine'
  160.   asah>asakwih               'rain'
  161.   karukuh>karukuh            'comb'
  162.   aluh>alukwih               'triton'


4.5»1«9 Class 11

       This, as noted briefly in chapter 5, is an unmarked class; hence

     sobsʊɪwes noons (both indigenous and loan words) that form exceptions

to the proposed noun classification rules. Although the nouns assume

the preverbal singular marker {n| for all syntactic functions,as does

the singular verb marker of class one nouns, the nouns assigned under

this class do not appear to imply masculine gender                            (except perhaps

those nouns such           as dubaren 'horrtb`llɪ aM. aun           'moon'    which might be

regarded       F+male} on the basis of folklore)              in their meanings nor do

they reflect any other sV\arecA            semantic categories.



4.4 Final Remarks

        There is a distinction between the Abu'                    'world-view' as set out

in     the     taxonomic     listing      earlier     and     the     semantic       basis    for

categorization of classes in Abu' .                 Yet it has been demonstrated               to

some     extent    that     they    can   be   related.     Phonology,        even    though    a

pervasive feature in the sytematization of the noun classes in Abu' ,

the Abu' world-view as portrayed in the Abu' 'folk-taxonomy' does play

a role in the determination of some of the noun classes.                             Therefore,

the     Abu'    world-view         is   reflected    to     some     extent    in     the    Abu'

class-system.

                           ABU1 SOCIAL GROUPS' SPEECH STYLES



5.1 Introduction

     In recent years,            linguistics as a discipline has thrived.                       In

pursuit of elegant answers to theoretical problems the exponents of,

or adherents       to,   linguistic theories of one type or another,                         have,

ironically,       tended    to   lose    touch with       the   fundamental      reality of

language     —     its     "function    in   establishing and           maintaining      social

relationships       and the      role language         plays in conveying information

about the speaker" (Trudgill 1974:14).

     To a large extent, the above remark reflects the past nature of

studies on New Guinea languages. The tendency has been for linguists

to go there with linguistic models in mind and to use the enormous

linguistic data available to test, expand or refute existing models or

to build new models to justify their positions. In so doing, they have

tended to lose sight of the fundamental role of language as known by

Papua New Guinean communities. How Papua New Guinea communities use

language     or    varieties      of    their    languages      in   their     societies        to

influence behaviour has been largely neglected.1                        The way Papua New

Guinea     communities       differentiate       and    contrast     the     speech    styles,

                              varieties used in their respective languages has

been much neglected and will probably remain so for a long time. It is

hoped that this gap will be somewhat reduced by the material that will




  1 Except   for    a    few studies      (cf.    Franklin      1977;    Laycock      1977    and
1979).
                                                                              171


be analysed in this chapter, which aims to examine speech styles—in

particular, the styles            or registers used by particular Abu*     social

groups, in Abu          society. The focus is on speech events, participants,

the setting, and the function and form of the styles.               All of these

sociolinguistic aspects are examined as an integrated whole for each

of the individual social styles identified.


5.1.0.1 Techniques used in the sociolinguistic analysis of styles

        In studying and describing speech styles of a community one is

faced        with the   problem of identifying the variables that correlate

with language differences in the. spseck ɑnə with the problem of deciding

what measure or standard to compare one Variable, against the. other.        For

present purposes I take 'standard' Abu' as that used in mixed company or

non-formal occasions or on other occasions when no special group or

topic is involved.          I also used informants'      comments about standard

versus non-standard as a guide.

        Ervin-Tripp      (1967)    outlined four general types of methods that

can be used in sociolinguistics. In brief,these are:

        1 .    Studies of the speech of social groups. This method assumes

some prior knowledge of the existence of social groups and the task

the fieldworker has is to ascertain, compare and present the form and

function of the styles of speech used by those special groups.

        2.     Ethnographic studies      (Hymes 1962).   This is the traditional

method where the fieldworker conducts empirical studies by observing

what kind of language is used on different occasions and interviewing

the participants about the styles identified.

        5.     Experimental studies.     This method involves the setting up of

hypothetical cases or situations to test specific linguistic trends.

        k. Survey studies. This method involves the distributing of forms and

questionnaires to speakers. This is more restricted in use in terms of the type

of target population. Although ideal for literate communities, this method

presents problems for many Papua New Guinea communities as these are illiterate

        In my attempt at                  the Abu' speech styles, I have been

principally guided by the notion of 'ethnography of speaking'           (Hymes

1962),    that is, method number 2        (although number 1   was undoubtedly

important) because I know the society.



5.2 The types of Abu' social speech styles

        The Abu' social speech styles are of two main types:        those that

are characterized by special linguistic forms (mainly different sets

of vocabulary)     and those that are not.        The latter consists of two

sub-categories: those characteristic of speakers who exhibit speech defects,

such as the speech of stammerers, and those that are differentiated from ordinary
                                  2
speech by "contextualization cues" , such as aural and visual signals. These

contextualization signals are readily evident during a "speech act"

defined as the " actual verbalization of a speaker's thoughts" (Searle

1965)• Each of these categories and subcategories will be discussed in

turn beginning with category 1: Vocabulary Differentiated Styles.



5.3 Speech Category I:Vocabulary Differentiated Styles

        There are four types of these:


   1. Pika betoisikeri 'baby talk/language'

   2. Waluhu'     'non-spoken linguistic code'

   3. Suluh 'secret-talk'

   4. Wa'awa'arasikeri (TP=tok haphap) 'innuendo'


5.3.1 Pika betoisikeri 'baby talk or language'

        Pika betoisikeri    'baby talk'   may be defined as the variety of

Abu'    that mothers and baby-sitters use when talking to children or

vice versa, or which children use among themselves. It differs from

other    social   groups'   styles   in   its special seʌ o?
                                                                                                       173


comparison with standard Abu'. Broadly speaking, it is in its overall

structural complexity a reduced form of adult speech.

        Linguistic features are not the only things that differentiate

this     style.       Pika    betoisikeri      is       also     determined         by   the       social

dimension     in       which     baby-talk         is    used.       The     role      and     type     of

participants,         the    nature     of   topics      dealt with          in this         style     are

salient determining variables,                just as are the linguistic features.

Before     presenting          these    linguistic        features          of   the     Abu'        child

language, it is worth pointing out a few preliminary remarks about the

general process of language acquisition by Abu' children.

        I have observed, not only during fieldwork but also in the past,

that during the first sixteen months of Abu' children's lives, Abu'

mothers tend to become over-enthusiastic about getting their children

talking.      Consequently,            they engage        themselves         in a high          rate    of

verbal     speech output,         much of which does                 not,    from the onlooker's

point of view,          seem to mean anything to the children spoken to. At

this age children, like children throughout the world, merely babble

away.

        From about the 20th month onwards, normal Abu' children begin to

produce                          meaningful        utterances         which mothers           or     child

minders    pick up and           decode.      They then          respond by doing whatever

actions    they think are required                 by children          to appease           them.    This

language inter-play marks the beginning of a dialogue - usually of a

rudimentary       -    nature     between     mothers          and    children.          Perhaps        an

anecdotal experience might help illustrate this generalization.

        One evening, my sister's 19 months old son while crying was heard

uttering    the word         tutu, which      is    an Abu           child    language        term     for

breast. My sister,               having been told of her son's crying, ran home

and asked her ten-year-old daughter why my nephew cried.                                      My niece

responded in Abu'            with the following adult speech form: nada'as uma
                                                                                                 174


nuɪnab     he-cried for breast'. My sister then breastfed the child and

                       lfʌls        erʃwvʒ.      This experience clearly demonstrates

an act of verbal behaviour characteristic of child-adult discourse

that involves two different sets of stylistic varieties of Abu'.

         Broadly   speaking,         language    inter-play of        this    nature goes         on

until about the 56th month, when children gradually build up a steady

command     of the adult language               form.    Consequently,       dika betoisikeri

'baby/child language' is normally discouraged by the adult population.

In this respect, a mother would be laughed to scorn, if she addressed

her, say? four-year-old child                 to have     her/his    food    using    the   child

language     form:      kou'        taita     'eat   food!'     when she       should,      or    is

expected to,use the adult form: wa' we'isi ine'i.

         Subject-matter        of    Abu'     dika   betoisikeri      'child     language'        is

mainly concerned with immediate needs and wants that are important to

the child. Consequently, it is limited with regards to the range of

topics it relates. Terms for food, referential terms for agnates are

overt features that characterize child language.

         Linguistically, dika betoisikeri 'child language' is marked by a

number of linguistic features, such as frequent repetition of certain

referential terms (e.g.               names of food ); frequent use of diminutives

for kinship terms         (e.g.        eben)     for the      adult form dabanari           'elder

brother' .     Indicative also of Abu'                  dika betoisikeri       are 4‘wAitMivies

that the Abu' use to refer especially to body parts of children.                                 For

example,     bur'ah   'leg'         in adult     speech    becomes    bur'ahikin in         child

language;     butum 'penis'           in adult speech becomes butumikin                in child

language.3.        Other than that, diminutivization is a fairly productive

 process,            thus an integral part of the standard Abu'                      speech. Its

use is evident when speakers make reference to... substandard growth of

things or creatures.


  5The use of dimunitives in child language have also been reported of
other Papua New Guinea communities, e.g. Laycock (.1977:133-4^.
                                                                                                175


        In the following table, I have provided examples of the most

common Abu' child language vocabulary items which are universally

used by the community.

        A few child language forms are onomatopoeic, that is, words

which imitate or echo the sounds created by their referents.

For example:

   27. plane/car        mbr        krahu' [imitates the rumbling sound                         of
                                          thunder, a plane or a carl

   28. to wash          mbr        sera'uh [imitates the sound of river as it
                                           pounds on the • cksl.

   29                   ehr      bul        [imitates the grunt of a Pig).
          pig

        There does not seem to be any underlying regularity of Abu' child

language    except that /s/ becomes /t/.                  Abu'   mothers when addressing

their    children,    regularly substitute ɪ for _s                in the        adult speech.

Examplps    of these     can be seen in numbers 1,                4,   6,   9,    14,    15,    20.

However,    as   no   detailed     study      of   this     has been    made,       it   is not
                                                                                          176


possible to say if this reflects the order of acquisition of these two
                    *
phonemes by Abu' children. Personal observations of our 19 months old

son (at the time this chapter was drafted) would seem to support such

a hypothesis but this needs checking. That is, John Nekitel was first

heard uttering words such as taa', taita, tutu, but he did not utter words

containing the voiceless alveolar fricative until much later.                           There

is   nothing    comparable       with    the    practice       of    Kalam   mothers,    who

substitute     voiced     for    unvoiced      phonemes       when   addressing   children

(Laycock     1977:134).


5-3«2 Waluhu1       'non-spoken linguistic code'

     The     Abu'    term   waluhu1      refers    to     a    process   which    involves

communication of messages through bokotoh ' whistling', suhafur lakuh

'blowing into folded hands'             (as described below), marekl, literally,

'mouth call1, and wind instruments sada' aluh 'triton'.                  Whistled-speech

is used in close-up communication,while mouth and triton calls are, in

principle, used to communicate important messages over distance. Given

fine weather conditions, messages encoded through the aluh 'triton' and

its local predecessor           (wandihil) can be picked up at about 8 to 10

kilometres away if blown on a high point.

      Mouth and triton calls are thus regarded as 'formal styles', while

whistled-speech is 'informal' and used for casual non-formal communication.

Although the methods of encoding messages through waluhu' differ, the

functions and the linguistic forms (according to auditory impressions)

are consistent and fairly similar.

      The code waluhu' was said to have originated in Warn (whose people

call it wanglehel).         It then spread among contiguous language

communities which share social, familial and cultural ties with them.

In this respect, the knowledge of this code among the Abu' is restricted

only to the Upper Abu'. Lower Abu' speakers generally, do not know it, and

those few who do know it learnt the code from their Warn or Upper Abu'
                                                                                                            177


friends or relatives. At the present most younger-generation of Upper

Abu      speakers   only      know      how     to       communicate          and    interpret           simple

messages, such as          'you       come'     or       'who    is    there',           through waluhu'.

Detailed messages, such as announcing of a man or woman's death                                              or

calling people together to perform a particular task,are usually the

preserve of waluhu'           specialists, who learnt the code from the elders.

Many of the waluhu' specialists have died.                                 Therefore the continuity

of the knowledge of the code in the future among the Upper Abu'                                              is

doubtful.

      How    or why     the    code was         developed,            we are not            sure.         Older

informants conjectured that the code developed to meet one main need.

The mountainous terrain makes travel difficult or slows it down such

that villages that live on adjacent ridges may be able to see each

other,    but may not hear each other in normal speech.                                     Consequently,

face to face communication cannot take place and in order for such to

take place requires one to travel down and up mountains which may take

hours.    To economize human energy                      and to enable prompt delivery of

messages,    the Upper Abu' probably adopted the code from the Warn. In

his    patrol    from      Aitape        to     Arasili          (a    Warn        village)        in     1921,

G.W.L.Townsend        made        a     note        of     one        of     the         waluhu'        namely,

whistled-speech (Townsend 1968:67-8). He remarked that                                       "people were

actually     conversing       with       one    another          by    means        of    whistle".          He

continues:

         "From a direction of a nearby hut came a 'wi wa wi wo'
      answered by the boy with 'we wu'. The person in the hut
      repeated its signal in the most decisive manner and the boy
      got up of his haunches and went to the hut .

      What was communicated in this whistled-speech is that the person

in the hut was asking the boy as to whether or not he was going and

the boy simply responded that he was.

      Townsend      also      admired         the    practical             value    of      the    code     and
                                                                                      178


mentioned       that during          the Second   World War,   some Arasili men were

recruited       and    used    the    code   to   relay messages           radios       AUe
messages they sent were not intercepted by outsiders. He reports:

           They acted as scouts for the Australian Army and were
       armed with voice radio sets. With these the Arasili men
       shadowed. Japanese coastal barge traffic, and through the air,
       in fluting tones, in the one Army code which was never
       changed, and never intercepted and never broken, they sent the
       information that the bombers awaited" (p.39).


        Accoustically, waluhu'           is typically marked by a series of abrupt

short     or    prolonged      syllabic      utterances   which    are   'trimmed   down’

approximants          of the   syllabic nuclei        of their corresponding spoken

forms.    All redundant grammatical features are omitted.                   Needless to

say,    only the barest minimum sufficient to communicate messages need

be sent. As can be seen in the texts provided below,                     the linguistic

forms of waluhu', speaking in terms of broad phonetic transcription,

are marked by vocalic sequences segmented by a glottal stop. The basic

vocalic       segments are      the high back round tense vowel [ul,            the low

vowel [a] and the mid-back rounded vowel [0], which is sometimes heard

as an open [ɔ] and at other times as a full rounded [o].

        In addition, the semi-vowels [hɔ and [w] can also be heard.                   The

function of the glottal stop intrusion is not too well understood.

There is some indication that it seems to function as a substitute for

many of the omitted consonants that would be there if the same call

MJere.           translated morpheme by morpheme into spoken speech as the

texts provided below will illustrate.


5.3.2.1 How messages are encoded through Waluhu'

       Encoding of messages via waluhu' may be done in four ways:-

        (a) by bokotoh         'whistling'. This is used when the addressed is

within hearing distance.                This is done by lowering the tongue to an

almost    resting position behind the               lower teeth-ridge.      This is to

ensure    a    free    flow of air which is modified by the                rounding and
                                                                                            179


unrounding of the lipa to obtain appropriate syllabic                            nuclei    that

appear to approximate their respective spoken forma.

       (b)    by sada'      marekl 'calling*.        Thia involves a movement of the

main         articulators         (raising/lowering          of     the          tongue     and

rounding/unrounding of the lips)                to an appropriate position for the

production of relevant nuclei                 to convey messages. This can be heard

at a relatively                  distance than       (a)

       (c) by blowing into            tightly folded hands. This and (d) are the

most strenuous and hence are known only by a few men among the waluhu'

specialists. This is done as follows. First, hands are folded tightly,

the forefingers are released to create a narrow cavity between the

forefingers and the thumbs for blowing into.                      When the caller blows

into it, he simultaneously allows the air to escape via a vent that

results at the inner section of the wrists and

       (d) by the use of wind instruments, namely, aɪuh 'triton* and its

local predecessor wandihil 'bamboo trumpet* (figs: 1 & 2).

       The following waluhu' texts were recorded at Womsis from two Abu*

Womenika (Upper Abu') speakers.                The first sample is a whistled-speech

text   by     Andreas       Wehitesim,    a   descendant     of   the     Uwa'    clan    which

migrated      to Womsis        eight generations ago from Womsak No.2                 (Nekitel

1975:8).       The    second     sample   comes      from Ignatius      Nararama*,        whose

father migrated to Womsis from Wandegei (a Warn village, map 1) and vdVose

mother               a Lower Abu'    speaker.        In the texts the broad phonetic

transcription         of whistled-speech        is   given    first with corresponding

standard      Abu'    and     accompanying English         translation underneath.          The

abbreviations         (wsp)    is used for "whistled-speech"            and (nig)     for the

corresponding normal or standard Abu                 which is given.        Double slashes

mark pauses during the utterance of whistled-speech.                        A fairly broad

indication of waluhu'            pitch contour is represented by high and low
                                                                                  180


lines.


5.3.2.2 Sample 1

     In this sample, Andreas Wehitesim is calling some of the Womsis

boys to go with him to do some work at the Womsis Community School

located   along the    bank of    the Atob and Mindil          junctions   (map   2).

Before he    begins,   however,    he    explains    briefly   in Tok Pisin what

whistled-speech is. In his view:


        "Nau mi laik wokim wanpela wisil. Wisil em olseɪn planti man
    i save i gat wisil, tasol ol i save wisil nating. Na mipela
    hia long Womsis i go inap long Warn — Urat, mipela i gat main
    bilong toktok insait long wisil. Yu narapela man harim yu ting
    olsem em i wisil nating. Tasol mi yet harim, mi gat tok insait
    long dispela wisil. Olsem na nambawan tok bilong mi,mi
    singautiɪn ol boi bai mipela i go long wanpela skul long hap
    bilong Atob bai mipela i go mekim wok. Nau mi laik singautim
    ol lain boi nau".



        I now wish to make a whistle.  Regarding whistle, though a
    lot    of people   do whistle,    their whistles    are often
    meaningless. However, here in Womsis right across to Warn—
    Urat, we send messages through whistling and so whistles to us
    are meaningful and important.When outsiders hear us whistle,
    they think our whistles are meaningless, but when we ourselves
    hear them, we can tell what messages are sent through
    whistling. And so the first message I want to send through
    whistled speech is a message to some young men to come with me
    to go and work at the school at Atob. I am calling the young
    men now.

5.3-3 Suluh 'secret-talk'

        Suluh 'secret-talk' has two meanings. Its primary one refers to

taboo      activities          that     members        of    traditional exclusive                  male      clubs

engage in, such as male rites of passage, adult male cult rites and

worship suluh (TP tambaran, black magic ehu'                                (TP sanguma), incantation

nukuh and naburawa                 (TP marila) and witchcraft auluh (TP poisen). It

may,     however,        be    extended         to    include        female secret            activities and

knowledge,          such      as     female       rites       of     passage,         and     other       related

activities pertaining to physical growth and health and the traditional

method of family planning.                      Thus the Abu’             speak of suluh numatawari

'female        secret         talk'       and      suluh       alemami         'male      secret        talk         or

knowledge'.

        Its     secondary          meaning       refers        to    secret        verbal       instructions,

narrative         accounts         of    the    history        and     development          of sorcery and

magic, words used in cult worship or mere verbal exchange of plans to

do with a          forthcoming tambaran                  cult activity.             In what        follows the

emphasis will be on male secret talk,as no examples of female secret

talk were obtained.
                                                                                                      183


       Suluh alemami        male secret talk' embraces a broad range of oral

knowledge op the sociocultural and political life of the Abu'.                                       This

knowledge      is   important         not     only    to    men, but    because what            men do

directly or indirectly affects all sections of the Abu'                              community, it

is   important      to    all Abu'.          Male    secrets    suluh alemami            include      (i)

verbal     instruction          on    rites o? pɑssouʒe.               (ii)       ehu'     'sorcery' ,

 witchcraft'         auluh,           'incantation'            nukuh        and      'enchantment'

naburawa'asi.

        Theoretically, suluh           'male secret knowledge/talk'                 of any of the

categories      listed     above may be             shared     with                        friends or

relatives      of   the    neighbouring         speech       communities       if    they      want    to

acquire skills in a particular suluh,so long as they meet the language

skills and payment requirements.                     Payment is made for the right to

acquire possession of the knowledge of suluh,whatever that might be.

Language skilly are important in that, until quite recently, when Tok

Pisin    had   proven      to    be    as     efficacious as          the   vernacular,         it    was

believed that suluh when expressed in another language would not work

or would yield inferior results. Warn ehu'                       'sorcery' spread initially

to   those villages         who       know    and    speak     Miye,    mainly       those     sharing

ethnolinguistic boundaries with them.                       It is presently known to have

been taught to other communities as well, such as the Kwanga and Urim.

Tok Pisin is increasingly becoming an effective medium through which

suluh of all kind may be passed on.

       When suluh 'secret-knowledge'                  is being discussed, men who have

knowledge ensure that no part of suluh is divulged to the public.                                      It

must be kept             secret at all times and at all costs.                       Any man found

leaking     suluh    to    non-members         of     the    cult-club        runs       the   risk of

getting himself killed by ohu'umi 'sorcerers^ who are the custodians

of the whole gamut of suluh.                   The fear of falling victims to sorcery

 led       the Abu'       to find ways to express subject-matter of suluh in
                                                                                              184


public without running the risks of divulging its secrecy. There are

two ways to do this.                                                 .

      One    is     to    disclose      secret    knowledge     within     the    precincts   of

forbidden adult male camps in the forest referred to as suluh hakara

lawasuma,     a metaphoric term which literally means                       'the place where

cultists     hang in trees'            and is used to conceal the camps from the

public.     Alternatively, erebihes          'ceremonial cult houses'              are used to

talk about suluh 'secret-knowledge'.

      The other is to devise a secret code that can be used to talk

about suluh in public without giving too much away.                          This supposedly

led to the development of a secret-talk vocabulary which is used to

express subject-matter of suluh.

      Some     of        these   are     given    in      the   table     below    by   way   of

illustration.            A longer list was difficult to obtain because of the

diiffi'ctjlties associated with           recording them.        All     forms    are given in

standard Abu'.           Those on the left are secret-language forms.

              edible greens.                           sorcerers fed on special diet
                                                       to prepare their bodies before
                                                       they go out to kill target
                                                       victims].

      Another important use of secret talk is in yam chants or nukuh

wa'usikuhi.         These are used when yams are harvested during the month
                                                                                                   185


of       Natarumes      (cf.    Abu'world-view paradigm,            chapt.4)*         The   chanter

intends the chant to win the good will of the yam deity called kimidi

kamada, to bring together all the best yams from other men's gardens

to the chanter's yam house(s). A text in this language style is given

below.         This text was recorded by Bubata from Balup village. In his

view,       the      chant     always    yielded       optimum   results      and hence       he

kept it a secret.              Realizing that he was aging and that he would

sooner or later die (which he did in mid-1985), he wanted to have it

recorded        in    order that        it   can be     preserved      and   passed    on   to the

younger generation of Abu' men.

          He began chanting with an open address to kimidi kamada the deity

of harvest and simultaneously he tapped a uduf 'black palm sheath' he sat

on in his remote hut as he went through the chant nukuh wa'usukuhi.                                 The

chant consists of three verses characterized by a few key words and

seemingly endless repetition of two focal verbs, flal and rir

'to increase'           and to     'multiply'.         The    chant,    being poetic        in

form and content,              lacks many of          the essential grammatical features

such      as   tense,     locatives,         moods,    etc.   that normally form part              of

standard Abu'. This lack is typical of most Abu'                         songs and chants and

is necessary if the chant or song is to have a sense of rhythmn that

fulfils aesthetic demands.

          The entries are flanked by numbers                  for reference       purposes and

where there is uncertainty about the meaning of an item, it is marked

by a question mark.

all, my chant for harvestirig yams]

        A part by       part analysis       of this          chant according       to syntactic

formula indicates that all lines are structurally similar.                               They all

have sentential subjects which are marked by [l.                            kimidi kamada 'a

spirit'; 3-         natarumes 'harvesting month and spirit'; 5- iye'                       '1'; 6.

enin 'it'; 9» anen 'he'; 12. ina'               'you singular'; 16.           fifikl 'bone'].

Of some consistency also is the recurrence of the imperative forms of

the   multiplicative verbs,          flal       'to    multiply'     (no.    4)    and     rir   'to

increase'      (no.    19)»   Other than that, the chant lines differ in most

other respects.         For example,     items        (no.      2 and 13)    are meaningless

syllables but fairly common               features in chants and songs.                   They are

utterance final residuals purported to emphasize the invocative nature

of the chant.          Those referenced by (nos.:               7, 8, 10,     14,    17,    18 and

20)   are items whose meanings are no longer known by the chanter nor

known by other Abu' men.           They are. probably archaic items                 or borrowed

words       whose   corresponding       terms     in    standard     Abu'     are    no     longer

recoverable.

        A   main difference        between      the    language     style     of    chants       and

standard Abu'         is that the latter         foAovO        staMard roies of grammar,

while the former may have a different grammar.                       In this respect, thɪ^

person      who     engages   in   an    ordinary        speech     act     conforms       to    the
                                                                                                                187


prescriptive and sociolinguistic rules of Abu' in order for him to be

properly       understood          by      the    addressed         or    if he      were       to      have   any

influence at all on the opinion of those he addresses.                                               The chant

narrator during chanting does not abide by the rules of grammar.                                               He,

being a specialist in mediating with members of the spirit world, has,

if you wish, poetic licence to bend the rules of the language any way

he    thinks       fit    to    win     the      good      will   of      the    spirit       he     addresses.

Consequently,             choice      of    words          is   most      crucial.         Redundant           and

peripheral          linguistic        elements          are     omitted, allowing             only       for    the

selection          and    use   of most           important core            words.       This      means       that

translation is difficult and in order to turn a poetic or chant line

into     an    acceptable          sentence           in    standard       Abu',        extra      grammatical

features need to be added.                       For example,          (50) although an acceptable

line in chants,             it is a nonsensical statement in standard Abu*. In

order, for example, for (50) to make sense in standard or normal Abu' style,

it must be dressed with all the necessary grammatical features as has

been done below, example (51).

50.    Iye’ anen rir-rir-rir- uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
       I he increase-increase-increase-uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.

51. Iye' i anen wada'as uma rirakaras.
    1sgS connective 3sgmS 2pl-excl.-real-do-things(OBJ.)
    resultative trans.-increase-IRR-FUT-things OBJ
    I and he (we)-did-things so that these things would
    increase or grow in large numbers.


       Another prominent feature that differentiates standard Abu' and

chants        is    the    recurrence            of     certain     core        words    in     utter antes..

Repetition,          although discouraged                   in dika       ka'is kekehi'i                'standard

ʌbu'1, is quite acceptable in songs and chants. Its presence in chants

probably reflects the psychological disposition of the chanter when

attempting          to     placate      a     deity        before        entreating       it       to    respond

favourably to             whatever      the      supplicant asks            for.         In view          of   the

inconceivable physical distance and the uncertainty surrounding the
                                                                                              188


chanter's mind on whether or not the deity being invoked would listen

and respond positively,the chanter sees the need to engage in unceasing

intercession marked linguistically by repetition of core words and/or

phrases.    Repetition in chants is a verbal device and is employed to

persuade the deity being addressed to bestow something upon those in

need of spiritual, mental and physical assistance.



        A further variety of male secret-talk/knowledge                      is the style of

a    'mobile oratory'.           Originally       this was only used in male secret

camps      the'ʌ was gradually allowed to be practised or used in

erebihes     'male      ceremonial     houses'      and     later in      the village       plaza

between    buanim         'ceremonial      feast    partners'       .     This    special     and

seemingly unique style of delivering speech by walking                           back and VoriVi

along a straight line is called kwianif. The informants described it

in Tok Pisin as: tok i go kam 'talk                    back and torʌts'. There are two

forms,    a spoken        form   and   a   sung    form.    The    spoken    form    is   called

kwianif and       the     sung form    is called bi' ilihi              'sung oratory'.      The

characteristics or differences between these two will be returned to

after some further details have been given about mobile oratory in

general.


5.3.3.2 Sesade' kwianif 'oratorical speech'

        Sesade'    kwianif 'oratorical            speech'    is   used for       formal speech

making- Orators not only walk back and forth along a straight line, but they

also stamp the ground as they walk along delivering their speeches.                          This

stamping on the ground with the right foot may have developed as a

result     of     angry    orators     restraining          themselves      from    physically

assulting their rival orators by indirectly pouring out their anger by

stamping hard on the ground.               Sociologically speaking, Sesade' kwianif

is   entirely rule-governed verbal behaviour.                      The rules emanate from

suluh     'male    secret-knowledge'        and must be           adhered    to by all Abu

people.
                                                                                                189


        Speech participants in sesade' kwianif must be graduates from the

    third    moulomu    and    'fourth'      kwal grades of suɪuh            (TP tambaran ).

This regulation means that if there are persons who have anything to

say,    they have to pass it on to eligible members to deliver on their

behalf. Senior members of clans who are eligible but cannot stand are

allowed to sit and deliver their speeches,but then they must tap their

lime gourds as a substitution for the stamping on the ground.

        Furthermore,     while sesade'         kwianif is in progress, a number of

    cuWurcA            restrictions are or should be observed, including, (a)

no swallowing of afenika 'saliva';                (b) abstaining from food and drink;

(c)    no standing on the part of anyone except the orators                             to avoid

unnecessary distraction;               (d)   silence must be         observed and         (e)   the

orator      must    cleanse    his mouth         with water       soon after       he   finishes

delivering        his speech before he            is allowed      to eat,     drink and chew

betelnut (Areca catechu). These taboos were laid down by custodians of

tambaran       kwal.       Infringement          of     these     restrictions        place     the

non-conformist at the mercy of suluhumi ' tambaran men', `ʌʌ`ɪo way piwvsV\

with ill-health or death. It was reported that some men who did not

observe these restrictions have been murdered by ohu'umi 'sorcerers'.

        Sesade'     kwianif was        dying out       in   the   1960s.      In    the    1950s,

sesade' kwianif was common during                             feasts where food and goods

were exchanged between ceremonial non-affinal clans.                            The     feast is

called waa', a name derived from the verb stem wa'                         '^0 eat'.      Waa* is

a     social   occasion       during     which    ceremonial       feast     rivals       (buanim)

compete against each other in both the display of food                             (especially

yams and pigs) and traditional wealth (e.g. beads, shells, plumes of

various birdsɔeteɔ, as well as in eating food meant to be consumed in

public. The first partner to finish his big saucepan of yam soup or

other       foods   prepared    for him by            the   rival buanim scores a point

against his feast rival.
                                                                                                    190

        When members of both feast-exchange parties are content with what

is being displayed, sesade1 kwianif does not occur. However, if one of

the parties         feels    that he has been humiliated by his rival                         in his

ostentatious display of fool and wealth and overall hospitality, then

   Vi-e.                      be prompted by their dismal performance                       to stage

sesade1      kwianif after the distribution and eating of the exchanged

food.        The    spokesman     expresses      on   behalf         of    his    clansmen        their

appreciation         for    the   outstanding      achievement            by    their    buanim and

admits their defeat and expresses a hope to do better in                                    the next

feast.

        If the clansmen being addressed pick up any challenging remarks

during an oration from an opposing side, a spokesman from the clan

being       addressed      disputes    the   remarks.          He    does       this    by adopting

similar oratorical speech style., but then he begins at the opposite

direction of the oratory line.

        In 1955, I saw a sesade' kwianif for the last time taking place

between my clan Nubat, and the Uwa' clan, our principal feast rival in

Womsis village. It was instigated by a general discontent among the

Nubat clansmen that the Uwa1 clansmen were failing to fulfil certain

expectations.         Nailiah,    one of my paternal uncles and a graduate of

suluh      moulomu',       initiated    a sesade1     kwianif.        He       commenced    with     an

abrupt      jerk    from     where he    was     sitting       and   simultaneously          sprayed

spittle towards the general direction where                          the Uwa'          clansmen were

assembling, started pounding his right foot on the ground and walked

briskly to and fro along an imaginary line. He gave a powerful speech

in a loud voice and appeared perturbed.

        His speech was responded to by Nelade'as, a kwal graduate from the

Uwa’       clan who     rebuked    Nailiah     for his         outburst        over     trivia.     His

remarks only infuriated Nailiah, who became more volatile.                                 Thus this

oratorical         speech session       turned    into     a    verbal         duel     involving
                                                                                      191

lashing ouʌ: ɑʌ eack cAWs past and present defeats. The rival mood of

this sesade       kwianif only attracted more eligible supporters on both

sides to take part,thus extending the session until early hours of the

following day.


5.3.3.3 Linguistic Features of Sesade1 kwianif

       Topics     discussed    during      sesade1    kwianif   determine    stylistic

differences between sesade1 kwianif and standard Abu'.                   In discussing

ordinary non-tambaran subject-matter,                standard Abu'    is used.    If the

subject-matter is to do with men's secrets, then speakers use hidden

speech, including       idiomatic and allusive words and/or phrases as some

did on the day referred to above.               If, however, participants find it

difficult to freely express themselves in public owing to the secret

nature of a given topic, it is postponed until arrangements are made

to have the topic discussed in detail in the secluded male tambaran

camps or in the male ceremonial houses to which women, children and

men who are not members of tambaran rites are forbidden entry. Within

the precincts of these exclusive clubs, plain standard Abu' is used to

present and discuss the subject-matter of suluh.


5.5.3.4 Bi'ilihi 'sung oratory'

       Sung   oratory   is    the   kind    of oratory used     during     the    special

social event called urih 'a folk dance'.                 This name of the dance is

derived from urih 'hand-drums', the basic percussion instruments used

in the dance.       It was              reported to have been given the Mulokoh

clansmen of Womsis by a terrestrial spirit called hwaulita.                       In this

dance,   dancers     line up     in a dance      formation as        diagrammed    below.

Female dancers are represented by a minus                 (-) symbol and male by a

plus   (+). The number of dancers may range from two to fifty men and

women usually in pairs.
       When an urih dance is about to be put on, participants trm into

four lines wAVs              dancers forming the inner flanks in pairs facing
                                                                                       192


                           Figure 5-1s     Urih Dance Formation




each other while their female dance partners form the outer flanks

facing    male dancers'        backs.    The    way this dance is performed      is as

follows. As soon as a man starts a song,all men immediately squat down

and start tapping their urih 'hand-drums' and join the song starter in

singing the song       and simultaneously ik-ty nnoue +keir bɪips up,                  tn

unison     with the    rhythm of the dance in readiness for a robust                 jerk

and undulating movement the moment the song increases in tempo. At this

time     male     participants     move        vivaciously   in   oscillation   in    an

outwards-inwards dance pattern indicated by the doubled prong arrow.

Female participants move in pace with male participants as the dance

increases       in tempo           res^a a?Y«r ɑ.       SOng line   is sung by male

participants.The dance participants move clockwise indicated by single

pronged    arrow      > until     a full        circle is completed.     The pattern

continues all through the night.

       When a bi'ihi 'oratorical song' is sung, women withdraw from the
                                                                                                 193

dance.     Men merely stand upright and stroll back and                          forth and       the

chorus     (consisting of male               participants     in     the dance)       chant    their

parts after the cantor nekebi1                  bi1ilihiri finishes chanting a line.

Women withdraw because a bi1ihi, like sesade1 kwianif, is ths preserve

of the male members of the tambnran cult. As a matter of principle,

mɑnj of the        restrictions on            how to behave when sesade1              kwianif is

being put on must be observed. Thus                   the cantor, viho'ɪs ɑ specialist in

bi'ilihi 'oratorical songs' composition and singing,must be a graduate

of the senior grades of the tambaran moulomu' and kwal.

        Tapping and drum beating is not done until towards the end of a

bi'ihi from which the punch line is sung. At that moment the drums are

beaten in rapid succession for about a minute and then the beating of

the drums are slowed down,leading eventually to a soft successive beat

coda.

        Bi' ilihi are chanted and not sung as ordinary Songs, and -tbe`ʃ are Aone

usually     during    lulls       in    an    urih   dance.      The   eligible       person    who

performs       the role     of a       cantor chants       the lines        of a bi' ihi       'sung

oratory'       in solo and the rest of the male participants, who form the

chorus     during     the    performance, repeat            after      the    cantor     finishes

chanting the last part of a line. The male chorus repeats the line in

reverse.       Tnat is,     they sing the last part first and                   the   first part

last, summarized in the broad formula whereby the cantor sings a line

from     X---- >    Y and    the male chorus repeats by singing the line in

reverse from        y ---- > X as illustrated in the bi'ilihi texts below.

        What    is described       above is       not done       when ordinary urih aaleh

'songs'    are sung.         ɪn     these,     men   sing in       unison    after a     song    is

introduced by anyone of the male participants, and women join in the

ordinary songs              respond m                    ɑfler ʌ-`ae. mo.

        Before     presenting          examples,      it      must     be     mentioned        that

subject-matter        of     most       urih     songs     and     most      other     songs    are
                                                                                           194


anthropocentric.      People are the main characters about whom songs are

composed    and sung.       Events in which human beings play an important

part predominate in the songs'            subject-matter and content. Allusions

to natural phenomena or natural events are made, but these are almost

always in connection with events that affect the human person.

       Historically     speaking, most         songs mirror     the past.         When sung,

chanted or recited, they conjure up historic events. Through songs the

Abu'   people redramatize, recreate, reiterate and, as it were, relive

their past history.          In this respect,          songs,   apart from their main

entertainment function, are oral records through which and by means of

which the Abu' oral history is preserved and passed on.

       The following two sets of examples show the differences between

ordinary songs and oratorical songs and between the language used in

ordinary songs and in ordinary speaking.

Ordinary urih songs


       (a) Aah O'olimi 'song about θ'oliɪn'.

       This song was composed in the 1930s to cajole O'olim, a Lulual(the.
Tok    Pisin term    for   'government     appointed      village      ehief^),    who    took


advantage    of his     vested    authority      to    become   too    authoritarian        in

conduct.    He was reported to have caned people who disobeyed orders,

even those who disturbed him when he was asleep at his home in Naras?

where the haus kiap (Tok Pisin word for a village rest house for the

government personnel) was located at that time.

       The song was a satire,          composed       to poke fun at the flamboyant

character    whose    behaviour    was    comparable       to   that    of many      of    the

colonial    kiaps who      patrolled     the   area during      those early years of

colonial administration.

      He is asleep, is asleep at his home in Naras.

        (b) Aah Sahu'ani Wehibeli 'Song about Sahu'an and Wehibel.)

        The     second song         is about    a secret      love affair between a             man

called     Wehibel,         a   chief   assistant      to    O'olim, and       a   woman     called

Sahu'an.         After       the    affair    both   got     married.    According      to    norms

covering kin relationship, sexual re\a\io<\5 and marriage between persons

who     share        a   numa'ita     'potential      father-in-law'         and   a   nekau*      'a

potential       daugther-in-law' <are not             allowed     because      a   nekau'     is    a

potential or marriage partner to one's son.                       Wehibel and Sahu'an,who

shared a numa'ita and nekau'                 relationship,breached the norm when they

got married. The song is another satire and its moral is of the same

kind as that of song (a).

      You call me as an in-law in-law
      Sahu'an, Wehibel, Bafita.

        (e) Nidiwakl Nadiroh 'song about Nidiwakl Nadiroh'

       This song is another historical narrative intended to                            relate a

habitual behaviour of Nidiwakl Nadiroh (the author's mother's father),

who    was accustomed           to banging a giant tree trunk near his home at

Asafuma.         This he did         to notify       people in advance of his arrival

whenever        he       returned    home    from     long    trips     to    other    villages.

Consequently he was nicknamed: N-a-dir-o-h 'He past-beat-trunk’.

  7ye is a meaningless syllable. It functions merely as a hesitative.

        Example 2

        In the following two examples of bi'ilihi 'oratorical songs', all

lines     have       been   numbered      and    question    marks    are     used     to     show

uncertainty about the meaning of items.

        (a) Nadi* amula' kuwaulu' e 'about a bird-of-paradise'

        This song is sung by Sawai Siduwakuhan who is referred to as the

cantor.        Note that the song is metaphoric in style and consequently

much of the subject-content is not known to many of my informants.                              In

my attempt at extracting the meaning of the first bi'ihi, I was unable

to piece together a meaningful discourse. ' This lack of understanding

is     attributed       largely     to    many    of   >ts   words, whose- meaning             are

unrecoverable from the synchronic lexis of standard Abu1.                            The words

flanked       by     question marks appear to`o^arehaie        or    rare     poetic        forms.

Compounding this characteristic is the virtual exclusion of many of

the important grammatical forms in bi'ilihi that are needed to produce

acceptable language. Forms that must be included in standard Abu' are

left    out    in bi'ilihi.        This makes      a morpheme by morpheme             analysis

difficult          and hence     makes comparative       remarks between bi-' ilihi and

other styles 'nmpossitʌe.

        Some insights are made possible by lines marked 64-67. In these

lines the cantor expressed his cynicism about the conflict between two

systems       of    ideas   or   two     sets of experiences,        the    traditional and

modern. He was concerned that certain aspects of traditional life were
                                  /
fast    disappearing and he had,                as a matter of fact,         reintroduced a

number of these such as folk-dances and chewing of betelnut.                                These

cultural things were banned for about 15 years at the beginning of a

millenarian movement that began in the late 1950s                      (ef.     footnote 5»

chapter 6'.).
                                                                                        197


        Sawai satirized these modern socio-politiccd changes by suffixing

terms for introduced sociopolitical institutions with the scatological

attributive {-iba}, a derived form of uba 'excreta' to deprecate these

modern political changes that were, in his view, taking up time that

could    have    been       well    spent    reviving   dwindling      aspects    of   Abu'

traditional life.            Thus sukul/skul (a loan word from TP) in standard

Abu     becomes sukuliba 'shitty school1 in bi'ilihi; kaunsol 'council’>

kaunsoliba      'shitty council';           komiti   'committee'   >   komitiba    'shitty

committee'; mitin ’meeting' > mitiniba 'shitty meeting'.

        (b) Amula' 1bird-of-paradise *

        This song was performed as a special favour for me by Ignatius

Nararama'      of Womsis, who is referred to as the cantor.                  It was done

outside the context of the urih dance.

        The song is about a woman who was having postnatal complications.

Her husband, a Subak clansman,was mildly scolded by the singer for not

taking the initiative in finding enough men to carry his wife to Suain,

where    she   was   to    be     picked   up   by   an   ambulance   from   the   Aitape

hospital.         The     woman      was    depicted      in   the    song    as   amula'

' bird-of-paradise', which is expressed in line 90 and was repeated in

line 105«       Line 90 is the punch line of this bi'ihi. The rest of the

lines emphasize or elaborate the theme focused upon in this line.

5.3«3.5 Linguistic characteristics of songs

        As already indicated     the styles of       sung   oratory and      ordinary

songs    differ   considerably   in    terms   of    linguistic    features.         The

latter, although they exhibit some degree of being poetic in form, are

not as heavy as poetic language of oratorical songs bi'ilihi.                       This

explains why it     is possible       to provide     a detailed    account     of    the

content of urih aaleh but not for bi' ilihi. Part of the reason is to

do with the bi'ilihi being the preserve of a small number of orators,

most of whom were dead before this study was done, and the other is to

do with words. Many of the words used               in example    2 text     (a),    for

instance, are not known to the orators nor are they known to those

interviewed. Consequently, the meaning of the following list of words

are unrecoverable from the synchronic lexis of Abu';                                       i
                                                                                        200

           usi' alum, unɪila' um' , seker' ifen and nadi' ioli.

        The above items could be borrowed from other related or unrelated

languages, or else are archaic words that belong to a special bi1ilihi

'sung oratory' vocabulary. In view of the fact that most other speech

styles have special sets of vocabulary of their own, I am inclined to

the view that the items listed above are part of the special bi'ilihi

vocabulary          which must   belong   to   the male       secret   speech.    In   this

respect,       it does    relate bi'ilihi. 'sung oratory'          to sesade'     kwianif

'oratorical         speech'   which   is part and parcel of the           tambaran cult

ethos.    The degree of comprehensibility between the language style of

ordinary Abu'         songs and that of poetry, including bi'ilihi, might be

broadly summarized as follows. Given standard Abu', the speech styles

indicative of bi'ilihi 'sung oratory, are marked off by lectal lines

that are determined virtually by special sets of vocabluaries. Broadly

speaking,      an understanding       of standard     Abu'    does not automatically

guarantee       a    fuller   understanding    of   language     of music     or poetry.

General    indications are        that    the degree     of    incomprehensibility, as

shown     in    the     sample   texts,   tends to     increase    as    we   move     from

sakatahakari          'ordinary language'      or dika    ka'is kekehi'i         'standard

Abu" to the more heavily poetic and/or metaphoric style of bi'ilihi

'sung oratory' and nukuh 'chants'.
                                                                                         201


5«3»4 Wa awa'arasikeri (TP=tok haphap) 'innuendo'

       Wa awa'arasikeri 'innuendo/ambiguous speech' is a way of speaking

where the speaker consciously makes a sly and oblique reference to

someone or something intended to be understood by the listener or a

participant    in a      conversation.       There    are    different varieties          of

innuendos. One uses vocabulary that suits one's needs.The other uses a

special set of vocabulary. The first is not very important and is done

in all languages of the world.            The other is restricted              to certain

domains    in some     languages89.     In Abu'      it is    in hunting.The Abu'

believe that animals,         especially the larger creatures such as pigs,

cassowaries and tree-kangaroos, have a dual state of life. They are not

mere animals, but rather they are humans or spirits who live under the

guise of animal skins. Pigs, for example, are believed to be ghosts of

dead relatives. As such,their senses are like those of human beings.

Use    of direct     speech would mean giving         the hunter's       chances away.

Animals would hear and hide.To confuse hunted animals like pigs and

thus increase the chances of a hunter, the Abu' reason that ambiguous

speech is a good way of talking about such activity when reference is

made to the hunter and animal life.

       Broadly speaking, hunting is not talked about.                  If someone asks

about the whereabouts of a man and if the man being asked about went

hunting,    the     addressed    if   s/he   knows     simply       responds    with     the

sentence:      n-a-la'     'he-past-went',     implicitly to         an unnamed        place

instead of using the more direct or explicit speech:                     nala nuwaduma

mahis 'he-went looking for wild game'. This ambiguous speech requires

that   a   hunter’s name      immediately becomes           taboo   during     the   entire




  8cf.            Laycock (l 979) and Franklin (l 977).

  9Laycock (,1979) reported that the Buin of the North Solomons Province
have developed and use hunting vocabulary when people go hunting
because animals themselves understand human speech and are likely to
run away and hide if ordinary language is used.
                                                                                             202


period of his absence. Pseudonyms are used instead. Thus a hunter is

referred      to   as     nakala'i   'the     wander about        man';    'pigs'    burguh in

oidinary      speech       becomes       weerihes     [^mahis       'animals]    'destructive

creatures         in hunting vocabulary.            Unaruwa 'cassowaries'           in ordinary

speech      is called      alimil    'bird'       in hunting language.          A shotgun is

referred     to as bata 'bamboo'            instead of the regular borrowed term—

masket/raipol. Wild game as a whole are referred to in hunting speech

as au'al sueili           'good edible greens'         instead of the usual standard

Abu'   form mahis and if             there is      no presence of current            or fairly

recent      animal      footprints    or    signs     in    the    hunting   area, then      the

sentence ouruf hotouf 'forest is dry'                      instead of the more explicit

form: mahis uwe'etin 'there are no wild game'Jθ



5»4 Speech Category II:The Speech of the handicapped and other styles

       Up    to    this    point,    I     have    examined       speech   styles     that   are

characterized by special sets of vocabulary that differentiate them

from dika ka'is kekehi'i 'standard Abu''. The rest of the chapter will

examine those speech styles used by people who have certain speech

defects      such as       stuttering      and     those    speech    categories      that   are

suggested     by colloquial          expressions or contextualization cues.                  The

Abu'   terms for the former are derived from the pathological defects.

The Abu' attribute speech defects to spirits and not to malfunctioning

of neurological commands that cause untimed or delayed speech output.




   1OA11 in all, the basic reason for coining of hunting vocabulary is
embedded in the dependency principle where things or activities
difficult to attain or achieve depend entirely on how a human person
is able to placate and establish peaceful coexistence not only with
the animal kingdom, but with the entire forest life.   Implicit speech
■is in the Abu' view, a very effective way to cajole the spirit world
to comply with human requests.
                                                                                                      203


5-4.1 Speech Category II (A)


5-4-1-1 Selehefikeri 'speech of stammerers'.

        Selehefikeri is the speech of stammerers.                              People       who exhibit

varying       degrees of       this speech         defect are    fairly common               among the

Abu'.    In Womsis,          for example,        about 30 percent              of    the    320   people

exhibit       this    defect    in varying         degrees    (some more             pronounced than

others)•

        The problem the Abu'               in general      seem to    have is           inability to

articulate s in consonant clusters.                      The voiceless alveolar fricative

does not occur next to consonants in Abu',                       and gives difficulty to

many     Abu'        speakers        and    many      speakers       of        Papuan        languages.

Consequently, the Abu' when borrowing Tok Pisin words that have an s+C

sequence,       a    vowel     is    inserted    between      them   to make           it    easier   to

pronounce. This explains why words like spika 'speaker', stia 'steer',

skul    'school'      are pronounced by Abu'               speakers as sipika,               sitia and

sukul respectively. The problem becomes more serious for those Abu'

who have speech defects who                  (depending on how bad they are) usually

omit the _s altogether or overstressed it. The problem with pronouncing

the    s+C    sound     sequence usually           leads    to overstressing of adjacent

sound    segments       and    inappropriate pauses which                 occur       at unexpected

syllabic boundaries causing a Tok Pisin phrase like em _i stret for

that     is     right     or        correct,     to    come    out        in        selehefikeri      as

e-e-e-e-eɪnmmm-ssssssss —tret.

        The most classic example among the Abu'                      was recorded at Balup.

The person who finds it difficult to pronounce the st- of the pidgin

simple sentence:             i stret       'it’s correct' prolongs the copula {il to

the extent that there is no                    time to     produce the          fricative segment,

which gets faded out completely. The resultant phrase again in broad

phonetic transcription is:                 iiiiiii--teret 'affirmative'.                    This person

since childhood- has been nicknamed Tutuhurait, d pseudonym adopted by
                                                                                           204


the Abu        to label this person after his apparently unusual "s-less"

utterance not only of the pidgin phrase referred to but in such Abu'

words    as:    i1 iis itaf       'lie/sleep     on   the   ground'     to    come   out   as:

ɪɪɪiɪ—taf 'ground'. This speech defect does alter meaning of words if

important sounds        (i.e.    phonemes)    are omitted      or replaced       in speech

utterances.

        In addition to the above,          there are also Abu' speakers who are

known     to    replace   _r     by   ɪ   such    that      given     words     like   ouruf

' forest/jungle' in normal speaker's speech becomes ouluf in stammerers

speech.       Similarly krahu> klahu 'plane' in selehefikeri. Since the two

phonemes [ /1/ and /r/ ] do not contrast in those specific linguistic

environments, the semantic content of the words remain unchanged.

        Normal speakers often find such speech defects hilarious but tend

to be polite enough not to show it in the presence of such persons,

unless they are on joking terms with the person. A village comedian,

however,       often finds delight in imitating the speech of his or her

stammerer acquaintance in informal joking sessions.


5.4-2 Category II (B)

        Under this category are speech styles that the Abu' recognize by

contextual       cues such as facial         expressions and        the tone     of voice.

These do not exhibit any marked linguistic differences from standard

Abu'    and    are   therefore    recognized     virtually by the            functions they

serve as well as the mood they are expressed in.^                     The most important

ones in Abu' are listed and described below.11




  11 Franklin (J977) had cited some of these speech categories in Kewa
of the Southern Highlands and Laycock (.1977) also made some remarks
about the same in his description of special languages of New Guinea.

5*4.2.1 Uirhin 'scolding'

        Urihin is a special way of talking to young people to shock them

into    listening and     behaving as    desired.         This    way of     talking is

characterized by offensive words and outright abuse.                   However, this

offensive and abusive language is not to be taken literally but rather

in   a spirit     of   educational    scolding".        That is    to mean     that the

scolded must not respond nor challenge the urihin given by his elder.

This can be seen in the following text where Numatira, a well respected

and well known traditional big-man who,                being alarmed at his son's

appaling conduct rebuked him with this style of language.

           " A! nafa ma bur'aleh numatawari atum, na'i bala nekewa ana
       wa'uis nekara'am nikamah a nikemine'am a nikaha ana mahis
       nikesibi' uma 'a'u' i betois a. Uwe' etin. Nafan na'is uma uba
       atuɪn.   Na'i bala nesahal nekarutu ana na'i bala nekada enes
       sesi asihisi ma alifes sekada krieinaɪnas a. Uwe'etin"!.



       Ho! so you merely hang around and fiddle around with legs of
       women and think you will grow yams and eat them to savour
       their taste. Or you reckon you will kill wild game and provide
       meat to your wife and children to eat. Not by any chance. You
       loaf around and are good for nothing but shit. You think you
       will get up and do something worthwhile to deserve favourable
       comments or praise from the community. None whatsoever!

        The    apparent   provocative    mood     of     urihin    appears     counter­

productive from the Western education physchological standpoint, but

it   is not so from the Abu'         standpoint.       To the Abu' ,   such negative

criticism given in the form of urihin by one's respectable seniors is

a most telling verbal challenge.          Any young person who is concerned

about acquring social recognition in the community must take serious

note    of such negative mood        of urihin.    It functions as a measuring

θɑɛɪθ         which young people s potential is tested.           If the speaker can

persuade the young through this kind of eloquence and go on to do what

they are expected to do to the satisfaction of their clans and the

community,      all parties   concerned would      be happy.       Broadly speaking,

such persons would gradually win social                recognition and would find
                                                                                  206


  little difficulty vying for "big-men" status in society. Those who do

  not would find it difficult to win status recognition in the community

  and may thus be branded betois numehelis ( literally 'bad children',

  but used derogativJj to mean "social misfits").


  5.4»2.2 Iho'ikeri 'banter'

        ɪho'ikeri   'banter'    is the name used for a speech variety that

  includes conscious teasing or mockery, usually between joking mates or

  potential marriage partners. It can,however, be.o$«djust for making fun.

  Thus, for example, Sahabu' of Womsis (died 1956) a well known comedian

  iho' ineri, used to banter the moment he arrived at the communal camp

  from his hamlet of Ulihikama.         His jokes were always aimed at poking

  fun at or teasing his awuw 'potential marriage partners'.

        Linguistically this language is characterized by the use of witty

  remarks and offensive        (idiomatic)2 phrases but the use of which is

  sanctioned by society.        For example, Sahabu'        could use phrases such

  as:

                bahal lawak iye'-i
                hold ! tree 1SG-GEN
                Hold my tree

        where 'tree' is being used idiomatically to mean 'penis' or kecould

mɑ,ke. scatological remarks such as:

          n -i      -bilele' o'osuf iye'-i
          2SG-N0NPST-lick    bottom 1SG -GEN
         'Lick my bottom/arse'.

        These   days   the   use   of   such    offensive   language   in   iho'ikeri

  'banter' is discouraged because it is regarded as sinful by many Abu'

  Christians.

  styles in Abu', their functions and contexts and type of participants

  have also been briefly indicated.

          5.6 Summary.

          '’’hus far the styles of those social groups' that the Abu' isolate

and justify as different from standard Abu' on the basis of salient

linguistic             and          sociological      features       have     been      presented        and

discussed. These, although fairly important, are not the only styles

available.             The Abu' also recognize other categories of speech. These

have       names       but     do       not   have   easily discernible          sets    of    linguistic

features.             They are recognized mainly by the tone of voice used or the

contexts             and the        circumstantial cues         characterising them.              Similar

styles are found in many other languages of the New Guinea area. y In

Abu'       the following categories have                     been     identified        to    contrast    in

function and context, but not necessarily in their linguistic forms.

                                                                                                    210


5«4.2.3 Dikebeseh ru'esi 'big or formal talk'

        Dikebeseh       ru'esi     is    the     name    used    for      'important      or    formal

speech .       Formal    speech     is     usually       convened      and     conducted       in   the

inter-clan       'camps'     to    discuss       sociopolitical           or    economic       issues.

Arbitration       over     land    disputes,        sorcery      accusations,           feasts,     and

matters      relating       to      the     much        more    recent         socio-economic        or

politico-educational aspects of Abu' life are excellent demonstrations

of the range of topics talked about during formal speech sessions.

        Although the speech participants are usually restricted to men,

women            participate        more so now than in                the past when certain

public issues and political decisions such as children's school fees,

the     local    women’s     club,        the    co-operative          and     public    works      are

discussed.

        Rules of social conduct and decency are expected or demanded from

participants. Verbal jokes or offensive remarks are disallowed but the

, respons-e.       form;, uwohu'        / oo' an affirmative interjection,is often

uttered by the audience to acknowledge, but not necessarily consent

to, what is being said.

        There are no special linguistic forms that mark off formal speech

from standard Abu'.              As a matter of fact, topics talked about during

formal speech sessions determine the nature of the style that is going

to be used.       If, for example, an inquiry is held into the death of a

good     hunter,     the     hunter       is     referred       to   in      idiomatic       language

expression as:

           keina naruma sikauis afa'i a s-a-he'
           bow   and    arrows 1 PL-GEN yPLN-R-go
          'Our good bow and arrows have gone'.

        This is to avoid mentioning the subject of death, which people

fear.      A    man's      death    may     be    referred      to     indirectly       as     n-a-he'

'he-past-go' instead of n-a-ka'                  'he-past-die        (cf. Nekitel 1979)»

        A point relevant to this speech category                       is that it provides the
                                                                                                 211


occasion    for young           Abu’   men    to vie       for influential         and articulate

speaker s     status.           If the       young men        can discuss       and    speak    with

remarkable        confidence, deueʌope ■VV~>air              orgomeAt                            and

offer solutions or suggestions to resolve pressing issues affecting

the society, they will be admired and will be gradually recognized as

spokespersons           for     the    community      in    inter-clan        or     inter-village

politics.


5»4.2.4 Asihikeri [TP=Tok Bilas^ 'verbal challenge'

      Asihikeri is a milder form of 'verbal challenge' discussed above.

It has little           in the way of offensive                phrases     typical     of urihin.

Whereas urihin is usually given to the young by elders in society,

asihikeri can be issued by Abu' people of any age, gender and social

position. It can be made at any place and in any speech situation. Its

primary function is              to    attest   an     individual's mental            or physical

ability     and     usually       motivates     the     individual       to   optimize her/his

talents to achieve goals of whatever one sets out to do.

5.4.2.5 Lekas waris [TP=tru-giaman tokɜ 'deceptive remarks'

      Deceptive remarks or statements are collectively referred to in

Abu' as lekas waris.              It is made up of the words lekas a derived form

o?    'left hand’, which the Abu' often associate with sinister thoughts

or doings,and waris 'falsehood'. When the two forms are combined, they

approximate the idea of 'half true* and 'half-lie' speech. It is not

marked by any special linguistic features. The truth and falsehood of

lekas waris might not be known at the time of conversation until what

has been said is being cross-checked.

      Those       who    constantly       spread      false    statements       or    rumours   are

ɪɪioknamed lekas—waris 'deceptive or unreliable reporters • Deliberate

lie   and   calumny           are also    designated        under   this      category    but   are

referred h>                       as warisikeri. Here the degree of offense is

determined    by        the malicious        intent    of     the individual speaker,           the
                                                                                212


speech   context in which such           statements are made    and   at whom the

statements     are    aimed.     Those   charged with defamatory remarks were

severely punished by           the village   court magistrate who     handed   down

verdicts suggested by the village court act.


5»4.2.6 Edilikeri 'true/factual talk'

      This category is a direct opposite of lekas-waris. It is factual

report or statements.          If a listener is doubtful about the authentieʤ

of what the speaker says, then the speaker may confirm what is said by

uttering the affirmative adl/edilisi in utterance final position.^


5.4.2.7 Numehelikeri 'abuse'

      Numehelikeri is abusive language such as that made by those who

are   angry.        Typical of   this speech catgeory      are insults such as:

maurisino', a phrase that approximates the English 'devil curses you'.

If a person is furious, then he might raise the volume of his verbal

output and thus may change the mood to wadahukari              'fighting/warring

language'. The term wadahukari is derived from wadah 'fight or war'.

The   range    of    words   constituting    offensive   vocabulary   is   limited.

Others of the same vein as the above are:           iluhino'ukl [lluhina + ukl]

*Iluhina damns'        the   addressed and mindanakl.The     last word     is used

frequently, but no one seems to know what it means.              Probably it has

to do with the physical appearance of a person who looks sickly and

not capable to resist          a physical blow if being challenged by another




       note of warning:    the Abu' , like many other Melanesians, have
been nicknamed "yes men/women". These are people who say "yes" when
they mean "they do not know", thinking that the best way to get rid of
a visitor is by saying yes to ■ whatever question is being asked.
Traditionally, the Abu' regard it as socially inappropriate to ask
strangers too many questions and by the same token, the visitor should
not overindulge in asking the Abu' too many questions. Until the Abu1
get to know more about the visitor, they tend to maintain their social
distance - a situation very much like the Athabascans of Alaska Tcf.
Scollɑn and Scollon, 19781. Broadly speaking, the Abu’, like most other
Melanesians, say "yes" when they might mean "no" or they may
acknowledge what is said to please the visitor or to cut conversations
short.
person. Use of scatological expressions such as                      nabilala1aba 'to lick

faeces' are commonly used when people become involved in a fight.                            A

loud-mouthed person is called nikinihari or kwukunuhari 'male/female

loud mouth'     and     speech indicative          of this        category of persons is

beberehika 'rowdy speech'.


5.4.2.8 Marekl-kvJakwhakikeri 'nagging talk'

     This      speech    category         is     typified     by    constant    nagging     or

complaints     about    trivia      and    which     tend    to    gain prominence within

domestic settings. For example, a constantly nagging wife is referred

to as marekl-whakwhakwu'i                             husband       marekl- whakwhakineri.


5.4«2.9 Miriairi* 'murmuring talk1 and si' isi'af 'whispering speech'.

     These     two    speech     types     are     derived    from the      onomatopoeic    or

imitative words that refer to the tone or quality of voice audible to

a third party listener when interlocutors are engaged in an ongoing

speech discourse.        The former is distinguished from the latter in that

in an act of mirimiri*, the volume of speech is relatively low and is

usually   identified with deep low volume of speech by men and                             the

latter    is   identified      by    a    low     moderately       soft   t£te-a-tfete   type.

Lovers'   talk or conversations were suggested as examples.

                                ABU' SPEECH SURROGATES



6.1 Introduction

        Chapters 3 and 5 described two aspects of verbal communication in

Abu', the grammar of the language and different speech styles used by

the Abu'. Language, although the primary medium of communication, is

not the only available medium. The Abu', for geographic and cultural

reasons use, as other communities in Melanesia                      and other parts of the

world        do, natural objects or modified forms of them to represent or

relay messages in conventionalized ways.                   These speech surrogates are

referred to in Abu’ as dikebeseh•hekeilesi, which means things that

bear messages.           It includes both (a) visual dikebeseh hekeilesi and

(b)     acoustic       sekedeserama         dikebesehasi        modes.   The   communicative

process per se is referred to in Abu' as sadeserema dikebeseh, which

implies an interchange of message, information, discussion and news.

        It    is   the   purpose      of    this    chapter to      analyse how    the Abu'

communicate by using these speech surrogates. Before doing that,                          it

must be noted that some of these speech surrogates have either been

abandoned or are being replaced by other                    communicative means such as

letter writing. Some are unique to the Abu' while others are the same

as     or    similar     to   those        used    by   other     Melanesian   communities,

especially those of the lowlanders of New Guinea^5. In this chapter,

 sekedeserama      dikebesehasi modes.          Gestures, which         constitute another

 form of non-verbal communication,were not studied in this study and

 are thus excluded from the description.



 6.2 Visual Speech Surrogates

       Two kinds of message-bearing devices, dikebeseh and hekeilesi,

are used.     These are plants and ochre.


 6.2.1 The General Use of Plants

         Lawas i madilih,       the Abu'      vernacular term for certain kinds of

 plant forms, are treated in descending order of social or cultural

 significance from the Abu' standpoint.


 6.2.1.1 Plants as Markers of Taboo cwxd

         The Abu', like others, use plants of various kinds as substitutes

 for messages that could well be expressed verbally or graphically.                        In

 other words, plants continue to express their message when no one is

 about. Their use in this way becomes, as it were, a form of permanent

 recording of a message. For example, a person may put a taboo on his

 garden hut by placing at the hut's entrance ɑ

 kunai      a type of ɪmperata cylindriea^with a knot tied in it or                       he

 may tie a croton onʌo          a coconut or a betelnut palm (Areca catechu) to

 warn off pilferers from picking the fruit.

         When such taboo signs are noticed,                the Abu'    warn each other to

 keep away from them by use of such phrases as : numehelisi 'bad things

 or danger'; nikebahalas kwe'isi'              'do not touch'; nikous kwe'isi'            'do

 not enter' or 'no entry '. The use of plants as such is a non-verbal

 communicative mode       that        seems   to be       common among    many illiterate

 communities      who   adopt        the   system    to    declare eorseerʌionoʌ rights   to

 property or                     •                                      Closely associated

 with the use       of plants as markers is the planting of crotons and
varieties of cordyline plants (uris, TP tanget) to mark off rights to

land. They can be seen at land boundary points along footpaths. These

land property markers are, as a rule, zealously guarded against damage

as they act as substitutes for codified and registered title descriptions.

When people damage these markers, it generally results in inter-or

intra-village feuds in the Womsis area, and probably throughout Papua

New Guinea.

     The   use   of plants         to    show direction appears         to   be    a    common
practice also among Melanesians^ and many non-literate communities around

the world. Among the Abu', directions are shown to a following party

by having the bottom of the plant pointing towards the journey's end

to suggest the Abu' general view that the top of anything is like the

beginning of a task, and the bottom the end of the task or activity.

     The Abu' have also used a certain kind of fern called usekesita,

(Nephrolepis     sp.)        to   keep    a   tally    of   fruit    (such   as   coconuts,

breadfruit and mangoes),           if the number picked is too many to record

mentally, or is so many that the Abu' counting system is too long and

cumbersome to use.        What happens is for the person on the ground who

'waits for the climber to pick off fruit, to simply break off leaves of

the fern and to leave the bottom of the leaf standing on the branch to

match each of the fruits taken from the tree.                  In principle, a return

home occurs only after the fruit picked match in number the partly

broken off usekesita leaves.

6.2.1.2 Plants as Totemic Symbols (usasɔ

     Certain     plants      are    declared      totems     usas    'totems'     and    have

deep-seated cultural and religious connections between a clan and its

totem. Of the Womsis clans, some are named after varieties of lianas,

bamboos,   species      of    cordyline       plants   or   trees.      Other     clans are

                                                                                               217

identified with speoiee of animals, insects, or reptiles. An important

practice     among   the   Abu'    is    presentation           to    the    dying     of    their

particular usas to take along to the place of the dead.                           Without the

u.aas ? ɪʤ was ®xplained,       the soul abelif of the deceased may not be

recognized     and   welcomed     by    ci\reoclj         dead       relatives.      When,     for

instance,     my uncle Benedictus Sa'uan died, we were faced with the

problem of finding a nubat 'dog'            type usas, dog being our totem, to

present him with his identification pass, so I was told, for him to

enter the city of the dead.^ It was finally agreed that a piece of a

liana     called   nubatiuh would       suffice     and    so    it    was    placed        on his

corpse.




   ^ln the 1960s, there was a form of millenarian movement among the
Abu' and the Suain. The movement was phrased in Tok Pisin as 'Taim
biɪong bilip' 'time of faith'. The first thing reported was that a
number of men and women reported having experienced deep comas that
lasted several hours. When these people regained consciousness, they
claimed that they had gone to see their dead ancestors, and a few
claimed to have gone to Heaven and met God, Jesus, St.   Mary and all
the angels and saints. An important message they brought back with
them, so one of them told me, was for the entire Abu' community to
undergo a spiritual reformation.      This reformation entailed an
abandonment of many of the traditional ritualistic values; sorcery,
witchcraft and all evil practices were preached against, and men who
had knowledge of sorcery or other evil doings were revealed to the
public and their magic and other evils were revealed and subsequently
destroyed.
  Certain aspects of culture were forbidden.     For example, betelnut
chewing, eating of red pandanus, and red clothes were forbidden
because they were said to reflect Christ's blood. Mourning over the
deceased was disallowed because it was regarded as offensive    t0 the
dead.   Folk dances and their regalia were disallowed for a period of
about 15 years, which became a real turning point in Abu' history.
While the motivation was to attain an Utopian life here on earth, the
adverse effect of this movement led to an abandonment of a lot of
useful and interesting traditional customs, many of which are now
unrecoverable. This long description should assist the reader +o see vAy
the Abu' have used the anglicised term siti to refer to the place of
the dead.
                                                                                           218


6.2.2 More Specific Use of Plants

      Plants of certain kinds are used by the Abu' for more specific

communicative functions as demonstrated belowθ.


6.2.2.1 Cordyline spp. (uris, TP tanget)

      JJris plants are species of cordyline.                 There are many different

types.      Wild varieties are not as important as domesticated ones. The

latter are grown around village edges, in gardens                     or along byways,

not      ly    for   decoration    but     more    importantly     for     their     use   in

sociocultural activities such as message sending.

      The     Abu'   regularly     use     uris    leaves    for   sending     particular

messages.      They do this by tying knots kulsuk in them and thus the

term saket was adopted probably from the Tok Pisin tanget to refer to

this message-sending device.             The process of sending saket is referred

to in Abu' as sada'         saket to be interpreted literally as '              they make

tanget'^.

      This     specific     use   of     saket    is   not   unique   to     Abu'.      Other
                                                                        8
Melanesian     communities also          use it    for   similar purposes.         In    this

respect, the data available on Abu' tanget system might not be new as

it had been cited elsewhereθ. The use of tanget for sending messages

was and maybe        still is     practised by many lowland Papua New Guinea



   θlt should pointed out that the kinds of plants used by different
speech communities to represent taboos may or may not be the same. The
use of plants by the Abu' as signs of taboo are restricted to about a
half a dozen or less. Conventional ones being: uris (Cordyline spp.);
erihis   'wild sugarcane leaves';    warel    'sword grass'   (lmperata
cylindrica; TP, kunai); and okositok 'moss fern'         (cf. Krempin,
1983:133).    Of these Cordyline plants., uris and moss ferns okositok
(sg.okosita) are feared most because of their association with
tambaran Spiritual cult worship' and magic spells nukuh.          Nukuh
'magic spells' are said over taboo signs, whose effects may cause
trespassers    to experience all sorts of physical ailments, such as
boils, swollen testicles and swollen limbs.
  ^Tanget is a Tok Pisin word. The concept of sending messages via the
tanget is difficult to express in one word in English, so the pidgin
term has been used.

communities.      Unfortunately,     the         finer details associated with

sending    messages via    this    speech    surrogate, such      as     what   message

content    may   be   represented     by    individual   knots,        what   social   or

cultural overtones the practice of saket sending has,                  who may send a

saket have not been previously discussed in literature, and so it is

important that the Abu' version of this system is dealt with to meet

this lack.

     Among     the Abu',   when a man wants        to send     a saket message to

someone else, he begins by breaking off a leaf from the variety of

cordyline that symbolizes the tambaran moulomu1, the third grade of

the tambaran cult (Cordyline terminalis 'inseripta' (ef. Krempin

(1983:109)).     Then he singes it over a fire to soften it and finally

he ties knots, kulsuk, in it.         The knots represent the message-blocks

the sender wants to send.         These are illustrated below (fig.21-1).

The knots are flanked by numbers for reference.

                       Figure 6-1:         Saket (TP=tanget)




     All   knots kulsuk     tied    in a     saket are   alike.         They function

             as mnemonic entities which represent blocks of messages that

sender of a tanget sends and whose message contents must be translated

to the receiver by the deliverer of the tanget. This the deliverer

does by holding out the tanget in front of the person addressed and
                                                                                              220


goes through each of the tanget and reiterates the block of message

each     knot   purports      to    represent.          Nararama',   one    of    my    Womsis

informants, demonstrated how to send a tanget accompanied with an oral

message as follows:


          "lye' Nararama' ada' saket ata tahe' uma ina' Otto. Numunah
       aha, nikihira' saket ene ma, nifan. Uwe'e safu' aha hekeki'i
       uba' numunah aha nida' dida'. Numunah aha nisahal nihi'i niti
       iye'."


          I, Nararama', send to you Otto this tanget.This day,(i.e.
       the day on which the addressed receives the tanget you stay,
       and so for the next day but should get ready on the day
       represented by knot 5 (i.e. the third day after the reception
       of the tanget. On the day represented by knot 6 you (the
       addressed) must come and see me.

        This message-sending by means of saket is called sada' saket.                          In

this context the saket functions as:                (1) a mnemonic device and (2) a

symbol of authority. As a mnemonic device, the tanget and the knots

tied in it help the messenger recall dates,                   the purpose of the visit

and so on. As a symbol of authority, if cofAmanJis ɑ certain respect and

guarantees      the    messenger      safe   conduct.     However,   if    it    is    lost   or

damaged, the carrier responsible for the loss or damage is placed in a'

position where he has to account for the damage or loss.                               In this

respect, the authoritative significance of the tanget not only demands

that the carrier of the tanget looks after it until he delivers it to

the    intended receiver,          but also    prevents     the   likelihood      of making

forged    tangets.         Once it     is received, the receiver must respond by

either sending an oral message or by using the aɑme. speech surrogate.


6.2.2.2 Eribika 'tree fern'

       Eribika        (pl.eribikes)    is    a variety of     tree   fern,       whose young

leaves are used as a vegetable to garnish cooked pig. Thus when a pig

is cooked in a mumu (the TP word for cooking done over heated stones)

is uncovered, the pig's entrails nulub and its stomach uluhu uta,as

well as any of the insignificant bits and pieces,are mixed with cooked
eribikes.
                                                                                            221


Even though some may receive only a handful, it is a gesture to ensure

that every woman is thought of, and thus prevents complaints that may

arise from families who might not have been given a share. From this

cultural dietary habit             is derived the use of eribika to symbolize a

pig.    When a hunter returns home with a young tree fern branch the

message represented is: naha bul 'he has killed a pig'. Men from the

village must then get ready to go and carry the pig home, while women

go to the bush to collect eribikes to cook with the pig, get stones,

collect firewood, leaves and heat stones to cook the pig in a mumu (earth

oven). All of these things may be done without a word being said if all those

present can read the message signified by the speech surrogate concerned.


6.2.2.3 Okosita 'moss fern'

        Moss     fern    okosita      (pl.okositok)   grows     as    undergrowth    in     the

jungle or in old gardens. It is used to represent several messages. It

is   used by hunters in a similar way to that of eribika. save that

okosita refers to a cassowary rather than a pig. Thus if a hunter is

seen returning home with an okosita branch stuck in his hair, those

familiar       with     that   non-verbal      communicative    act     conclude     that     a

cassowary unaru' has been killed. The plant okosita is used for this

purpose        because    to    the    Abu',    its   light     green    fronds     resemble

cassowary's feathers ahuwalub.

        Okosita may also be used to indirectly suggest a man's knowledge

of     another    person's      witchcraft      auluh10.       The    accuser   shows     this

knowledge by pulling up okosita and strewing it sporadically along the

path he is following.              If the victim-to-be is a mother with a child,

then the practice is to display okosita with a young okosita attached



  10Auluh refers to a neatly tied bundle of witchcraft matter, whose
constituents may comprise food crumbs, human hair, fingernails, chewed
betelnut husks, remains of partly smoked cheroot, cigarette butts and
human exuviae which      mUeJ'vs wrtb pulverized herbs, vines, stones,
ginger and other matter believed to catalyze the efficacy of auluh
when it is heated over a fire to end the life of the bewitched.
                                                                                               222


to   it   to   symbolize      that   person.       The    child       may or may not          be a

potential victim.



6.3 The use of body-paint, white ochre, and charcoal

        The principal        types of body paint are plant dyes,                     clay paints

(ochre of various colours),               and charcoal.         The use of body paint is

observed       during        traditional       folk-dances            asulub         (sg.asubul).

Participants in a dance apply dye to their bodies as part of their

dance     decor and     as    beautification.        Different         dances may also          be

identified and differentiated from each other not only by their varied

               rhythm beats of hand-drums                urih    (sg.uruh)     and     slit-gong

wamuta     (pl. wamutok), but also by the type and pattern of dye dancers

adorn themselves with.           A dance called mowanfor example, is marked

specifically by the application of white ochre to dancers'                             bodies in

the form of disjointed circles and parallel lines all over the body.

The urih dance, on the other hand,                 is typified usually by red plant

dye, which      dancers      apply   to    their    bodies       in    any   manner      to   suit

individual taste.

        White ochre is used not only in the ɪnowan dance. It is outside

the context of asulub that white ochre becomes more important as a

speech surrogate.

        When mourners apply white ochre to their bodies during funerals,

it symbolizes grief for deceased relatives. It was customary in the

1950s     to see distant kin         from other villages decorated with white

ochre     conducting a        mock attack      called, uih against             the    deceased's

village. It is characterized by throwing harmless projectiles at the

mourners, s^eɑrinʒ              walls of houses           and axing down of areca and

coconut palms,     Gnetum trees(du'unas) and other plants grown in the




  11 This folk-dance was bougth off the Matapau in 1952. It was claimed
to have been given them by a mauran 'ghost'
                                                                                        225


village.         The mock attack is made for two main reasons:                 first,    to

demonstrate anger at their relatives for letting their relative die,

and second,       to chase away the ghosts believed to be present in the

village.    When     the    uih abates,       the   attackers   retreat   to   where    the

corpse is laid and begin their wailing which usually last a day or

two.    The mock attack has also been reported by Tuzin (1976: 258-60)

for the Ilahita Arapesh,who were observed using white ochre to express

their grief.        This mock attack is also practised by the Warn, but it does

not seem to be practised outside the abovementioned language groups.

       Abu1 men also apply charcoal to their bodies                        particular,

their faces       when going out to attack enemies.             Its application served

initially as a camouflage, and oner time it has come to be associated

with anger.        At other times in the past, men have been seen painting

their faces in red paint or wearing red hibiscus when in a challenging

mood. However, red hue is associated more so with tambaran decoration

than with anger, and as such,its use is restricted to tambaran cult

initiates. Any non-meɪnber found wearing red flowers, paint or feathers

would be challenged for an unauthorized emulation of the traditional

decoration of the tambaran and consequently be subjected to verbal or

other rebuke from the custodians of the tambaran cult.

       If   we    compare    the     Abu'   association    of   colours   with    certain

emotive     states with       that    of    the West, we   notice marked       contrasts.

Whereas white signifies an emotive state of grief to the Abu', the

same is associated with joy by Western communities who associate dark

with grief        ( demonstrated by their wearing of dark garments during

funerals).       The Abu'    in contrast associate dark colours with anger,

while Western communities associate red with blood, anger and danger.

Red is a highly respectable colour to the Abu                     for its association

with the highest form of spiritual belief manifested in the tambaran

cult   activities.          Other colours      such as     (ati'al   'yellow',    keredu'
                                                                                   224


'blue',     asu’   'green',    bebeyo1      'purple'     and    a'a'a'ah    'dun   or

greyish-brown', though used, are mainly decorative, rather than speech

surrogates as such.

      Why the Abu' associate white with grief is a question that cannot

be satisfactorily answered.          One plausible explanation is to do with

the Abu     popularized image of ghosts. Individuals who claimed to have

seen apparitions often say that the ghosts they saw were covered in

white ashes. White is also known to be a near-universal feature that

many Melanesian communities tend to associate              with death.


6.3»1 Art and Tattoos

      Carvings and paintings are virtually non-existent among the Abu'.

Tattoos,    on the other hand,       are evident and the pattern of tattoos

observed on Abu' people's bodies are characterized usually by simple

dots or circles around the eyes.           Sporadic semi-circles and parallel

disjointed lines are tattooed elsewhere on the body. Tattoos were once

done purely for decoration, but          since people have learned to read and

write, personal names, names of spouses-to-be and the like are often

tattooed on exposed parts of the body. Sometimes the names of secret

lovers are also tattooed on the body, usually on the less public parts

such as the upper part of the thighs or immediately below the navel.

These serve primarily as remembrance of romances before (and sometimes

after)     marriage.    Unfortunately, Taltoos    tnoj    become       a   cause   of

frequent jealousy or friction among spouses.



6.4 Acoustic Speech Surrogates Sakadeserema dikebesehasi

      Representing spoken language through sound-producing instruments

is   not unique    to   the Abu' ,    nor it   is unique       to Melanesia.   It is

worldwide (cf.e.g. Farb 1957 :297). Acoustic instruments are used by

the Abu' to declare important messages such as arrival of important

visitors or to declare war on enemies, announcing deaths and important
                                                                                             225


social and cultural              festivities are described below.              The domain in

which acoustic instruments are used as speech surrogates by the Abu'

is    that involving           the transmission        of simple messages.          Instruments

used are of two types: (1) percussion and (2) wind instruments.


6.4.1 Percussion Instruments

        Percussion instruments number three: slit-gong wamuta; kokoiin (a

naturally       hollow         tree)    and    hand-drum        uruh,    as    described     and

illustrated below.             Though the primary function of wamuta and urih is

to provide rhythm accompaniment to folk-dances,                         these are also used

together with the kokoiin to beat out simple message-bearing signals.


6.4.1.1 Wamuta 'slit gong'

        One of our Womsis informants expressed, with an air of nostalgia,

that     the   knowledge        of wamuta     'slit-gong'       beats to      signal messages

among the Abu'       of today is not as elaborate or as varied as that of

the     Abu'    of   his        father's      generation.       The     following    quotation
                           ♦
illustrates      this    informant's view.          It    is    written in        standard Tok

Pisin.

          "..., em garamut ol i save paitim tasol. 01 i save long ol
       bikpela tok.    I no long liklik toktok nabaut-nabaut. Olsem
       mipela manki bilong nau i no kisim gud we bilong paitim
       garamut. Bipo paitim garamut long singautim nem bilong man na
       meri, bikpela man i gat. Tasol nau mipela nogat. Paitim tasol
       singautim ol manmeri long kam bun^."

          ...,the slit-gong is oiʌlɜ     beaten to declare important
       messages.        Not any and every bit of news or talk, ^t's
       like this— we kids of today do not or have not learned how to
       beat out messages through the slit-gong. In the old days there
       were slit-gong signals to call out names of men, women, and
       names of important men. Today we no longer possess them. We
       only know how to beat the slit-gong to call people together.

        The    slit-gong       signal    (which   is     also    known    among     the   Abelam

 Laycock (.1974:141)) was demonstrated by Nararama' with the following

beats, which were beaten out on a slit-gong with a hard slit-gong stick

referred       to as natakl. He began by spitting into the air                                 \

pounded on the slit-gong thus:
                                                                                    226

        Kul is an onomatopoeic noun, referring particularly to the sound

emitted    when    a   slit-gong wamuta     or kokoiin is struck with a hard

object. There were brief pauses heard after kul-k. The beats are close

together and. are strong at the beginning and. after each of the pauses,

they then gradually decrease in strength to fairly soft beats at the

end.

       The kul-kul drum signal is beaten out on the wamuta to call and

hurry people together at the reception of important persons,such as a

'government official1 TP kiap or the reception of important messages

intended for all people.The other drum signals alluded to by Nararama'

cannot be demonstrated as no one knows how to make them. All that is

available is oral claims of their existence in the past.

       My paternal uncles Joseph Ubaim (a long-time catechist at Bongos

and     other    Kwanga-speaking      villages)   and    his   brother    Sopik    (the

councillor of Womsis-Welihika at the time the fieldwork for this study

was undertaken) informed us that the ʌbu' slit-gong signal system is

not as elaborate as that of the Kwanga.                 In their unequivocal view

(expressed in Tok Pisin):

         "garamut em i maus bilong ol Kwanga".             'Slit-gong is their
       (Kwangs's) mouthpiece'.

       Anything simple      or complex     they claimed        could be   relayed by

slit-gong signals.        Indeed   it would be interesting to ascertain how

elaborate the Kwanga slit-gong signal system is as reported by the

author’s uncles who lived and worked among the Kwanga for a period

totalling       some   20 years.The    author's   childhood     impressions   of   the

Kwanga drum signal system heard during 1956-7 when he spent some time

with hiθ uncle Joseph Ubaim at Bongos is hazy after a period of 20

some years.       From the general description provided by Sopik and Ubaim,
                                                                                                       227


it `ɔeenʌs liKelj ■VVxat     Kviourxty* sM-goivjSignals are similar to their southern

neighbour Kwoma’s drum signals (Zemp and Kaufmann,                                 1969).      The Urat

whose linguistic boundary is to the north of the Kwanga (map 4), can

also send and receive messages through slit-gong signal system^.

        The Abu1 slit-gong signal system is simple and straighforward and

is characterized by a basic, invariable monosignal.                                   This the author

believes is also true for oYV>er                       communities, such as the Kwoma and

Kwanga and the so-called 'talking drum' of the Kele of Congo and other

tone     language        communities           of     western     and         central    Africa       (cf.
Carrington θ971 s90-94^.                                            The Abu'       slit-gong signal

system bears no close connection to spoken language as do the sound

signals      of    the   bamboo         trumpet       wandihil      and triton               aluh.      As

mentioned         earlier,    the       Abu'    onomatopoeic        kul       refers    to   the     sound

emitted when slit-gongs are struck and not to the linguistic content of

the message the drum signal is purported to represent.                                   If the kul-k

system were to be given verbal interpretation, the approximate meaning

would be:

       alemam i numatawa datarumari   akana ehiehi
       men   and women   come-together here quickly
       'Ladies and gentlemen come here quickly'.

        It   does     not    at     all    correspond        with       the    drum     signal     kul-k.

Similar       views         have        been        expressed      by     Farb        (1957:297)      and

Laycock(1974:141-2)               and     the       latter      author's        view     agrees      with

observations by Zemp and Kaufmann (1969) on this phenomenon.                                     Thus the

view here contrasts drastically with the view held by those who claim

that there is a close connection between the drum signals analysed by

                        13
them and spoken language '.

6»4«1«2 kokoiin 'natural tree-hole'

        Holes in trees or kokolib (sg.kokoiin) may be heard used usually

by passers-by to relay advance signals to the host-to-be of a village

to be visited. As illustrated on the next page, a kokoiin approximates

a slit-gong.      It is a natural hole in trees whose resonating chamber

may be cleaned out so as to allow for effectiveness when beaten with a

hard    object.   When     kokoiin   signals      are    received, the host-to-be         is

informed      in advance    of    the visitor's         arrival, and V>e can         4ke u^oo.\

preparations such as making a fire out in a public rest house, laying

out    udis   (sheaths   from dark palms)         for     sitting and   get     betelnuts

(Areca catechu) and tobacco so'eh ready to welcome and entertain the

guests when they arrive.

        Unlike the slit-gong and hand-drum, whose. use is restricted only

to tambaran cult initiates suluhumi,               the kokoiin is not governed by

any social or cultural rules. Thus it can be beaten at any time during

the day by anyone. Being accessible to the public at large,the kokoiin

signals beaten out are fairly irregular and because of the smaller

resonating chamber of the kokoiin,             the sound it emits does not travel

long distances like that of the wamuta 'slit-gong'.


6.4.1.3 ʊruh 'hand-drum'

        The hand-drums urih        (sg.uruh)is used mostly for the purpose of

providing rhythm accompaniment to folk-dances asulub. When beaten in

tambaran cult houses erebihes,it is metaphorically alluded to as: usak

suluhi kara 'cult spirit's netbag is rattling', which is a secretive

phraseology used and popularized by the custodians of tambaran cult

ethos    to   conceal    and     mystify   what    suluhumi     initiates      do   in   the

erebihes.
                                                                                      229

6.5 Wind Instruments

        Wind instruments used as speech surrogates by the Abu'                   are (i)

wandihil        'bamboo    trumpet'      and     (ii)    aluh      'triton/conchshell'.

Transverse flutes are also used but their function is primarily to do

with    tambaran cult      dances     (viz.    buas, meikahu', moulomu'       and kwal.

These are kept secret in erebihes 'cult houses'. The transverse flutes

are pitched a tone apart         to create the two pitches characterized by a

simple    melody alternating          between    the    players.      The   pitches   are

regarded as voices of suluh,which is feared by women,                       children and

non-initiated men. Transverse flutes are also known and used by the

Warn,   Urat,    Aruek,    Kwanga ɑnl other Sepik       communities, as weU as other

Melanesian communities (cf. Fischer (l 984)).              Thus they are not unique

to the Abu'.

        Message sending by blowing through the bamboo trumpet wandihil

and     the     triton    aluh   (fig.          6-2)    involves     communication    of

meaning-bearing sounds signals which can be roughly represented by a
                                                                                                   230


    morpheme-by-morpheme         analysis      in spoken        speech similar to whistled

    speech described in the preceding chapter. It is thus regarded by the

    Abu'   as    closer    to    spoken      language    than     that   represented        by drum

    signals.

           The process of encoding messages via aluh and wandihil is similar

    to that of whistled speech and thus need                 not be reiterated in detail.

    Briefly,      the   process       of    sending     messages     through        the   two     wind

    instruments is done by directing sound energy through the hollowed out

    resonating chambers of these instruments' by blowing in or across the

    orifice marked        (a)    in   the    diagram below and           to   emerge      at b.    The

    opening at which the exhaled sound energy emerges is regulated with

    the right hand to enable the production of meaning-bearing signals of

    varied      intentsity and        amplitude,      somewhat     like       the   blowing       of   a

    trumpet.

described for percussion instruments, in that women and children are

not     allowed   to    use    them.         They    are      male-only    instruments.

Unfortunately, opportunities are not readily available these days for

young Abu      men to receive regular practical experience on their use.

They have been virtually phased out in all West Sepik Abu' villages.

Wandihil,for example, was phased out in the 1940s or thereabouts,while

the triton was used for the last time by the late Sawai Siduwakuhen, a

well recognized village leader at Uhunabul (see map 5) in 1978. The

same instrument, however, is still used on a much more regular basis

among    the   Womsak   and   Amom,    as   well    as Warn    villages.   A shift    in

residence from ridgetop to inter-clan communal camps along the banks

of the Danmap,     Atob and Mindil rivers in the 1950s was given as the

main reason for the dwindling use of the triton among the West Sepik

Abu'-speaking villages.        Sound waves produced by the triton from low

geographic points do not carry,             being blocked by the mountain walls

that are a common feature in the Abu' area. The establishment of these

camps along river banks in the 1950s,               encouraged a lot of people to

eventually abandon their clan-based villages situated on the top of

mountain ridges. Permanent residence in communal camps along the river

banks meant that most people are living together, and so messages can

be passed on by word of mouth.              However,   in Womsak, Amom,       and VJam,

where people still reside in their traditional homes situated along

the Torricelli Range ridges,the use of aluh to relay messages is still

continued. When I was there for fieldwork in 1931, four triton calls

were heard.

        The first of these calls was made by Aaron Siyawe at Wandegei

across    to Hambini    (both are Warn villages,           see map 1), informing my

mother-in-law that I had arrived from Maprik and that I would spend

that night with the Delehes at Erinigeme, a hamlet of Hambini 2. It

also asked that my mother-in-law send Gertrude Deimbule, my wife, who
                                                                                              232


was on a two months visit from Womsis to sθθ her folks, and Francis

Mahite (her brother) to meet me in the morning and take me to Hambini

1   (my in-laws village) the next day. The message relayed through the

triton was perfectly understood by my in-laws living on the opposite

ridge.     In the morning my wife and my brother-in-law,as well as a few

of their relatives, arrived at Erinigeme to take me and my baggage to

Hambini where we spent the first few weeks of my fieldwork.

        The other three triton calls were heard at Womsak.                          One was a

call     heard       halfway      between    Hambini and         Amom on   the day     we were

travelling to Womsis. This call was made at Walbata (a few kilometres

south of Amom) to Umama village (map 1). It was noticeably different

from the one heard at Wandegei. It was marked by rapid calls which

were     later interpreted           to     the    fieldworker by those         familiar with

triton calls as a declaration of anger at Sangiele of Umama who was

alleged to have attempted to commit adultery with a niece of the man

who made the call. Soon after our arrival at Amom, the caller arrived

with his        clansmen            so also did ike accused       with his      clansmen.    Both

parties    started lasting oɔt o,ʌ eacVs           oʌvʌer   with abusive language           and a

fight was about to occur when luckily both the village councillor and

the village court magistrate arrived and managed to calm them down.

After a        lengthy hearing         of    the   case,    an amicable solution        to the

conflict was reached.              The other triton call was made by Pranis at

Womsak     2    to    Francis Aunu'         (a cousin       to   the   fieldworker)    at    Amom,

signalling him to leave the next morning with a party of carriers for

Supari to meet his brother, Alphonse Salipen,who was on his way to take

up his new posting as the headmaster of Womsis Community School1 in

1982.

        The last triton call was made again by Pranis to men at Amom to

intercept and beat up               two Albinama men who were              on    their way     to

Matapau        for   the   1981     Christmas Christian Fellowship Reunion.                   The
                                                                                      233


reason for the attack was given that it was in retaliation for an

attack Albinama gangs had made on a Suparik vehicle. The attack left

Francis Aunu' with a deep cut on his left eyebrow. Though the three

Albinama    men   were   innocent,    being   from     the   same   village     as    the

culprits, they were nonetheless regarded as suitable substitutes for

those who actually made the attack. The three Albinama men were able

to interpret the message conveyed through the triton and consequently

they detoured around        om by another route and thus avoided what could

have been a nasty encounter. This incident stresses the importance of

being able to interpret messages sent by speech surrogates.

       Unfortunately, none of the triton calls referred to above were

recorded because I was not ready for them and, besides, they occurred

without notice.     However, the triton calls are accoustically fairly

much like whistled speech (cf. chapt.5), so that the examples

demonstrating whistled speech can be taken as an indication.                  The

signals are impressionistically fairly similar.



6.6 Participants’ Role in Communication by Speech Surrogates

       There are social and cultural norms that determine who among the

Abu’ may or may not use the speech surrogates described above to

communicate with, even though these norms are not often talked about. Women

and children may, for instance, use simple taboo signs                  (i.e.       signs

that   do   not   have   tambaran    overtones)   to    declare     their   rights     to

property. They do not send tanget to other members of the community,

however.     This practice is restricted to alemam ubahimi                  'big men',

who,   by definition,      are men    who have       been through     the different

tambaran grades referred to in chapter 5« Women and children avoid the

use of those speech surrogates that are likely to upset the inner group

members of the tambaran cult.

       It should be pointed out, by way of conclusion, that Abu* speech

surrogates although technologically not very advanced compared with
                                                                         234


modern   telecommunication   and   graphic    devices,   did    have   clear

communicative   functions    similar   to    their   modern    counterparts.

Therefore, their value has to be measured in those terms.
                                                                                            235




                                            CHAPTER 7


                               LANGUAGE ATTITUDES AND USE



 7.0.0.1 Purpose

        In   chapter   5>     ɪ   dealt    with   the    Abu1    speech     repertoire,     the

 variety of social groups' styles (registers) available for use by the

 Abu'   in different         sociocultural and        sociopolitical contexts.             This

 chapter     focusses on       two interconnected        themes.    These     are:    1.   Abu'

 attitudes     to    language(s)      and    2.   the    practical     use    of     languages

 available     to    them.        Before    turning     our     attention    to    these    two

 sub-themes, it is important to review briefly previous sociolinguistic

 studies of Papua New Guinea languages, especially those focussing on

 multilingualism.


 7.0.0.2 Background

        Linguistic     studies that have been done in Papua New Guinea to

 date ha\ie. Concentrated onttxe descriptive and comparative aspects of the

 vernacular     languages/         These      types     of    linguistic      studies      have

 contributed greatly to knowledge of the genetic relationships of Papua

 New Guinea languages.

        However,    sociolinguistic studies that have been carried out on




    1 Writings on genetic relationship of languages in Papua New Guinea
 are many and so we cannot acknowledge all the authors who have
 contributed towards it here. There are some major works that need to
 be cited, however, such as Wurm ed. (1975, 1976); Capell(l969, 197j);
 Chowning (197CJ; Dutton ɑ 96^; (19711; Healey (1964); Hooley and McElhanon
(1970); Laycock (196^; Wurm (1960, 1971a); Wurm and Laycock (1961); Z'graggen
QI 971); and McKaughan (19753) • A lot of this knowledge is shown in the
 Language Atlas of the Pacific Area (Wurm, S.A. and Shiro Hattori,eds.,
 Part I, 1981.
                                                                                            236


 these     languages amount           to no    more than a handful:           e.g.    Salisbury

(1962) Laycock (1966, 1979\ Sankoff Q968, 1969, 1976 a™) 1977'; Wurm (1966,

 1967?,    and Wurm et.al, (l979\             Lincoln< 19691;    and   Bradshaw Q978\     As a

 result,        little is known about the             kinds of attitudes and knowledge

Papua New Guinea communities have about the social role of language

 and languages. Against this background we can see that there is a need

 for greater in-depth studies on different sociolinguistic aspects such

as people's views about language, their use of language, what it means

 to be multilingual and so on. Results ascertained from sociolinguistic

 studies done on hitherto undescribed communities in different parts of

 Papua      New    Guinea      will    undoubtedly       enrich    the   meagre      knowledge

 presently available on this relatively less researched area, as Wurm

 (1979) and other authors have conceded. Such knowledge may also serve

 useful purposes in the area of social and educational planning and

 thus the development of Papua New Guinea.

          In the Sepik region, sociolinguistic issues have not been studied

 in    depth       in    any    speech        community.     General     observations     have

 nonetheless been made, mainly by Laycock (l966,                       1969 and 1979? This

 study on Abu'          language attitudes and use is prompted mainly by the

 concern expressed above.

          The data for the following remarks about Abu' language attitudes

 and      use    were    obtained      during     1980-84.      They   are    extracted    from

 observations and interviews made mainly at Womsis. The Womsis data are

 supplemented           by     observations        and     interviews        made    at   other

 Abu'-speaking villages.               In add ition, a few Suain, Muhiang, Miye and

 Aruek speakers were interviewed to ascertain their                            or,the different

 issues alluded to in the chapter
                                                                                               237


7.0.1 Attitudes to language(s)



        In     order     to   enable      our    analysis     of     Abu1   attitudes      towards

language and languages and the implications for the Abu' practical use

of languages to fall into place, we should note at the outset the Abu'

metalinguistic views about language and languages. This                                 of Papua

New Guinea linguistics has been overlooked for far too long. A Similar

view     was        expressed      by    MiihlhSusler       (1983:102)      where    he,    after

discussing other points, concludes that:

       "Linguists   are only    too   prepared    to impose  their
    metalinguistic   system  on   languages    they  do  not know
    sufficiently, thereby depriving themselves from finding out
    about some of the most intriguing aspects of human language".

                                                        [Muhlhausler 1983:2031

        Metalinguistic          views    of     Papua    New Guinea     language communities

have indeed been given little attention. In the following paragraphs

we will address this issue, but will restrict our discussion only to

the Abu' viewpoints. As a point of departure, we present how the Abu'

theorize about the origin of their language.                          Following that, we will

describe how the Abu' name or characterize foreign languages.


7.0.1.1 Mythological view of the origin of language and languages

        The Abu' share a view that their language was a gift from the

gpirit Dedeifina.             Dedeifina is a personification of the echo. Thus

Dedeifina          is   the   male      spirit    who     imitates    people   when     talking,

shouting,          singing and whistling and is claimed                 to be heard when one

approaches cliffs or holes in rocks and mountains. It is interesting

to note here too that the Miye and Aruek share similar mythologies

about        the    origin    of     their    languages.        The     Miye   say   Silehi,    a

culture-hero,           gave them       language and culture while the Aruek claim

that their language was a gift from a male deity called Elipinik, who

is the spirit of language,                   fire and earthquake. He is also said to
                                                                                            238


have given them the gift of tongues                                        oʌker \aAOjuo.<y$y



7-1 How the Abu         characterize foreign languages

        The Abu'   characterize or name languages other than their own in

one of several ways:            1) by using descriptive phrases; 2) by using the

words    for   'no'    or     'not'     in other languages;          3) by using toponyms

and/or ethnic names; 4) by naming languages after artefacts and 5) by

associating language or dialect with topographic features.                            Each of

these ways of naming is described in more detail below.


7.1.0.1 Language Naming by the use of descriptive phrases

        A common way the Abu' distinguish their language from others is

by using the possessive pronouns 'ours'                      and 'theirs'       in combination

with    language such as bulan afa’i "our speech or language" versus

bulan esisi "their speech or language".                       Alternatively the Abu'        use

phrases    such as:         bulan/dika etin         "one     talk   or one      language"   for

referring to their own as distinct from dika or dikas dei'akas "other

language(s)".         Foreign      languages       as   a     collective     phenomenon     are

designated as         dikebeseh sesisesi, which means all other distant and

inconsequential languages .


7.1.0.2 Language Naming by the use of negatives

        At least two languages in the Abu'                   area are named by using the

words for 'no'        or 'not'        in them;                      one of these is Aruek,

the other is Weri'. The Aruek language name is ' aruek', derived from

aruek                  'no'   or      'not'   in that       language.    Similarly, Weri*    is

derived    from    the      negative      weri'.    This      practice    is,    however,   not

restricted to the Abu'. Laycock (1973) commented on this practice, and




   ^The Miye myth was told to the writer by Mahite Butehe at the Warn
village of Hambini in August,1991, while the Aruek myth was collected
from Kelmendu of Aruk village epth in any speech community. General
observations were    roadie i`rv Womsis in January 1982.
                                                                                              259


extended it to languages that perhaps already did not do so. Thus the

Nuku and the Wape communities located further to the southwest and

northwest respectively of the Abu' have been given language names that

are   derived       from these          languages'      words    for   the negative    "no”    or

 not .        The Nuku and Wati communities'                 (both are located near Nuku

town) name their language Mehek, which is derived from the negative

mehek,while the Wape community's language is Olo, a word derived from

the   negative olo.             Apparently this                           method   of deriving

names for languages from terms for negatives in the given languages is

common.       One possible reason for this is to do with the question of

ethnolinguistic identity. People generally want to regard themselves

as different from others.                  One way of emphasizing differences is to

choose a linguistic               tag that will bring out the given community's

ethnolinguistic           uniqueness.       The     use     of   the    terms   for   negatives

provides       a   seʌ     of convenient          and     distinct     labels which    in many

instances match the linguists'                   demonstration of        the languages       of a
          ʒ
region.


7.1.0.5 Language Naming by the use of toponyms or ethnic names

      The Abu', like other speech communities, use toponyms and/or an

ethnic    name     to     refer    to    other    languages      in    their area.    Thus    the

Ulau-Suain language (see map 1)                    is referred to as Ulehes or Suenes.

The   suffix       {-s|    is    a nominal        concord    morpheme     denoting "people".

Individual village names are also used to refer to different speech

communities within those languages.                     Linguistically,     this is done as

follows: N + Toponym + Possessive morpheme where N is the word for

language or speech followed by the name of the village (or Toponym),

which is suffixed with the nominal concord inflective |-n-}                            and the

possessive morpheme !-i#| in word final position. Por example:




  ^For discussion on how linguists give names to languages or name
languages, see Laycock (1973).
                                                                                        240

          talk Yakamul -EV-NCE-GEN
         ’Yakamul

          bulan Ali -n -i
          talk Ali -NCE-GEN
         'Ali speech or language'                     At>o’ bokɑh = U^>per Akw'

     In this connection, Tok Pisin, until very recently, was regarded

as   the     whiteman's      language.         The     Abu'   phrase     dika     duasimiri

'whitemqn's language' was probably coined in the 1930s to designate

this language which the Abu' heard spoken by white colonial government

or mission personnel          and    those    Abu1     (such as   catechists)      who had

contacts with white people outside the Abu' area.                      Nowadays, however,

this view of Tok Pisin is no longer held as the Abu'                       have come to

realize that Tok Pisin is no longer a whiteman's language. It is a

language they now use more readily and is, in point of fact,                          their

alternative language for communication.                 English, by the way,        is now

regarded as dika duasimiri 'whiteman's language'.                  German kɪɪɔs always,

been        known   to the    Abu'    as     Siaman    (<TP Siaman).     Malay,

spoken by Malay birds-of-paradise hunters and traders, is called dika

Malai or dika Parani.           The term pa rani is unfamiliar to young Abu’

people. It seems plausible that parani was derived most probably from

the Malay word for "chopper".


7.1.0.4 Language Naming by associating language with artefacts

     Tok Pisin is not only called dika duasimiri, as discussed,                      above,

but is also known as alibalika, a remodified form of alibal 'knife'.

When asked why the Abu' refer to Tok Pisin as a "knife-language'^ no

Abu' seemed to know why. One explanation may be that it was associated

with the introduction of knives (and other western implements) in the

1920s.     At that time, metal implements such as the knife and the axe

were introduced and possessed by whitemen and their native servants




  4-cf. chapter 2. Further information on the spread of Malay in what
was then German New Guinea can be found in Seiler (1982 and 1983).
and later by Abu' who had some form of contact with white men. Both

groups not only had the metal implements but also shared knowledge of

Tok Pisin,and it was quite possible and appeared logical for the Abu'

to easily associate Tok Pisin as a language of those who had the knife

alibal and other metal implements.                      Consequently, the language could

have     been    initially         named      alibal     dika       'knife   language',      which

subsequently dropped the jd-] in dika 'language', thus resulting in the

present form alibalika.


7.1.0.5 Language Naming by associating language or dialect with

          topographic features

       The final method of naming                is by use of topographic features to

designate languages or dialects. Indeed the Abu' use this to refer to

dialects of their own language.                    These are,         as noted     earlier    (see

chapter 2), Abu' Womenika 'Upper Abu''                    (which is literally translated

as Abu' ©V tine ridɪðesɔ ɑnd Abu'          Ounibisima       'Lower Abu'         of Abu'   of the

lowlands.       TVni-s   latter     Variety      is the dialect spoken by those who

dwell in villages situated along the low banks of the Mabam (Danmap )

River.

       Apparently        this     method   is    also     used      elsewhere    in   Papua New

Guinea.     Thus,        for example,      the    Koiari of         the central Province of

Papua New Guinea use terms in their language to distinguish between

Koiari spoken by mountain-dwellers and that spoken by lowlanders.



7.2 Language Use

       Having dealt with the Abu'               attitudes to language and languages, I

next go on to consider the question of Abu'                          linguistic repertoire,

"the range of languages...available for use" (Crystal 1980:304) by the

Abu'     community.         Gumperz ɑr`d               ɪsdsɑ 971)     have   accentuated      the




  ^l)utton,pers. com.,Canberra, 1984«
                                                                                            242


collective    sense      of     'repertoire'      to   mean     the     range   of   language

varieties    within      a    speech     community     that     enable    members    of    that

community    to perform         specific social        roles.    This    broader sense       of

linguistic repertoire of the Abu' has been dealt with in chapter 5» In

this    chapter,    I    will    be    considering     only     the   range     of languages

available for use by the Abu' .                I will consider who among the Abu'

speak what other languages, how well and how widely these languages

are    spoken and       how   these     are   acquired.   Later I will          consider the

social    variables that determine why,                when and       to whom    foreign and

related languages are spoken. Before turning to                       the question of the

Abu' practical use of their linguistic repertoire, some understanding

of the influential social units on the use of language and languages

is necessary.


7.2.0.1 Social Parameters

        Influential      social       units   which    serve     as    parameters    for     an

analysis of the use of many languages (multilingualism) and language

mixing between Abu' and foreign languages are the nuclear family, the

clan,    the dialect group, and the village.                  Of secondary influence on

the nature of language use among the Abu' are members of groups which

represent the local, provincial and national government, the Catholic

Mission and other Christian groups operating in the Abu' area.                            There

is also an increasing number of English-speaking Abu'. This group of

English-speaking Abu' constitutes a total of 63 people (approximately

1.123) out of the total Abu' population of 5,700 (cf. chapt.1, p.1).

Of the 63 English-ɜpeaking Abu'^ 40 are grade six school-leavers and

this number was increased at the end of the 1984 school year when the

Womsis primary school produced its first                   grade six       school leavers.

Twenty-three of the English-speaking Abu’ have completed various stages

of secondary education and have attended career training institutions,

and they include four university graduates. This sector of the Abu ’ are being
                                                                                              243


absorbed in the work force of the Papua New Guinea population and are

serving in numerous capacities throughout the country.

        A typical Abu' clan consists of members varying from a minimum of

six males to a maximum of ten. These men represent the heads of the

given     clan.    The     clans    are distinguished          from    each other by        their

allegiance to their totems which are represented by natural phenomena

drawn     from     the     animal,       insect     and     plant    kingdom.    The   clan    is

patrilineal and is an exogamous social unit which serves as the basis

for   inter-/intra-village sociopolitical                    activities which foster the

Abu' use of foreign languages.


7.2.1 Social Reasons for Foreign. Language Use


7.2.1.1        Why the Abu' use foreign languages

        Abu'    people     speak or use           foreign    languages    for a variety of

reasons.          In     the    final    analysis,        however,    social,    cultural     and

political contacts are the main factors which induce the Abu'                             to use

foreign languages.             They were and still are a non-trading community.

Trade is not a major factor in determining why the Abu' use foreign
languages.&

        Social     prestige        and    political         expediency    have     been    cited

elsewhere (cf.                   Sankoff (l968, 1976, 1977) and references therein)

as motivating factors which obliged speakers of one language to learn

and   speak      foreign       languages.    The    Abu'     emphasize the       following two

factors.       They regard listening and speaking skills in languages other




  ^lt should be noted that the people of Womsak 1 make clay pots.
However, owing to the meagre pottery clay they have, pots made were
often insufficient to warrant intra-language trade.    Those made were
distributed primarily among the Abu'. To secure a pot, request must be
made six to twelve months in advance to one’s Womsak relatives. Some
of the Womsak pots did find their way to their neighbouring language
communities, especially the Miye, Aruek and Muhiang. These pots were
given as gifts, rather than being traded        in an organized trade
contact such as that occurring between the Tumeleo islanders and the
Aitape-coastal villages (Woichom 1979).
                                                                                                      244


than    Abu1     as    an     added       advantage       to   their      social,     political       and

cultural positions. Multilingual ability is both admired and valued,

for it enhances the multilingual speakers' social status and aids such

speakers        in    their     inter-       and     intra-language           sociopolitical          and

cultural        relations       in    a     similar       manner     to    modern     international

diplomacy,       where       knowledge       of foreign           languages    helps       a     diplomat

communicate                   more     effectively         than is otherwise possible.                 It

should    be     reemphasized         that    the     Abu'     value greatly          the       practical

advantage       that knowledge            of foreign or related               languages provides.

Knowledge       of other people's languages enables the Abu'                               to    ask for

food, water, betelnut, tobacco and other consumer items when they find

themselves in ɑ foreign             language-speaking environment.

        Knowledge          of foreign      languages also helps             the     Abu'       know what

other people say about them, sotkeɔ are                            able to defend themselves.

Several oral reports were also told of how a few Womsis recruiters

avoided being speared by the Miye and Urat during the 1920s when they

went out recruiting plantation labourers because those Womsis men knew

and spoke some Miye and Urat. Several Abu' catechists who helped their

white missionary colleagues spread Christianity among the Kwanga, Seim

and Urat (see map 4) in the 1940s and early 1950s told anecdotes also

of how it was easier for them to carry out their tasks after they

acquired varying levels of speaking ability in the local vernaculars

of their areas of operation.

        Field    observations showed               that    Abu'    bilingual        or multilingual

speakers choose to speak in one or another foreign language to prevent

the     person        at     whom     unfavourable           comments      were      directed       from

understanding the content of what is being said. This was done if it

was established that such a person did not know the foreign language

used.

        A personal anecdote will help clarify this. On a Saturday morning
                                                                                                          245


during a vegetable market held at the Womeie community school, a woman

from Welihika was               selling an       arboreal cuscus for eight kina.                          Not

having had any meat for several weeks, I went straight up to the woman

and pulled out some money and negotiated with the woman to reduce the

cost to five kina.               The woman did not want the offer, and as                               I was

standing there waiting and hoping for                             her          to change her mind, a

paternal aunt noticed what was happening and walked across to me and

whispered          softly into my ears in Miye, advising me not to waste my

money on such a pitiful cuscus. It would be better to wait, she said,

to see if someone else came in with better meat for a better                                        price.

What she expressed in Miye WqS as follows:

                   Munuhe fitafitai' ene nɪoni ubahinenɪe. Lasu' la.
                   cuscus small-small yet money big-very. Forget it

                  'The cuscus is too small for the money being charged
                   for it — forget it.'


        I        took   her     advice     and    refrained          from       engaging      in

further          bargaining.       As      I    was    about       to        leave    the    market

area,        a Wolum      man     arrived       with     a    leg       of    pork,     which      he

sold        to     me   for     five     kina    after       an     interchange         of

utterances in Tok Pisin and Abu'.

       It was pointed out that the Abu* speak foreign languages for a

variety of reasons,              the main reasons being for social prestige, and

cultural and politcal advantages. Other than this, the Abu' were also

observed          to use foreign languages in certain speech situations where

they wanted to make unfavourable comments or express views about other

Abu'    speakers.             This is done only          if it was established                  that the

persons talked about did not know the foreign languages used. It is a

way of trying to prevent                  the prospect of being intimidated by those

talked       about if unfavourable comments about                            them are expressed           in

languages that they know.

    7.2.2 Abu' Linguistic Repertoire

            Languages    available     for    use     by    the     Abu'    in   various    social

    contexts are described          below. We will consider who among the Abu'

    speak what other languages, how well and                      wide these      languages are

    spoken and how these are              acquired.     Later we shall consider social

    variables that determine when,               why and to whom foreign and related

    languages are spoken.


    7.2.2.1 Alibalika 'Tok Pisin'

            Bradshaw    [1978:28]    in    his    article      on          'Multilingualism    and

    Language Mixture Among the Numbami' of the Morobe Patrol Post reports

    that:

                 anyonefamong the Numbami ] who can speak at all can
        speak Tok Pisin "

            just as well as Numbami. This state of affairs is a result of the

    Numbami having had exposure to urban centres, such as Lae,                             and the

                   contacts    that young Numbami              students and        employees in

    particular have with        neighbouring and            distant language        groups with

    whom they live and work.

            Similar observations can be made about the Abu'. Alibalika or Tok

    Pisin    is the     predominant language of communication among the Abu' ,

    especially     among    children       and    the      younger    generation     of    Womsis

    parents. In a general survey of                 the entire Womsis population of 320

    people, it was found that only four mature women (two have since died)

    had only passive knowledge or control of Tok Pisin. These four mature

    women were in their mid-40s. A general survey of 50 Womsis children

    under 10 years of age and 30 grade six leavers showed that 75 percent

    of each of these two young age groups rely exclusively on Tok Pisin

    for daily communication, and approximately 30 percent of the children

    and 7 per cent of the grade six leavers were native speakers of Tok

»   Pisin.    Knowledge of Tok Pisin, unlike the situation in the past where
                                                                               247


it    used   to   be   acquired   from other Tok   Pisin speakers    usually   in

situations outside the Abu'          area (such as plantations),     can now be

acquired from other resident Womsis or Abu'.           So there is a certain

amount of creolization going on in a place where once Abu'               was the

only language known and spoken [see Nekitel 1984"!. The prevalent use

of Tok Pisin in Womsis generally reflects, as it were, its predominant

use in other Abu' villages especially in most of the West Sepik Abu'

villages (viz. Balup, Malin, Aspesis, Wolum, Welihika and Womsis) and

to a considerable extent,Amom and the Womsak villages.

       Several sociolinguistic factors contribute to Tok Pisin becoming

the most important language of communication in Womsis and other Abu'

villages. Some of these are discussed below.

       Expatriates who visit Abu' villages never show any interest in

learning Abu' because their communicative needs are well served by Tok

Pisin. This was and is the language of communication between villagers

and expatriates,        and also with visitors from other communities. The

parish priest,         the kiap 'administration officer,'   medical officers,

and various national or expatriate government and mission personnel

always use some form of Tok Pisin.For many expatriates, the "Tokmasta"

variety was used. Those Abu' speakers who did not yet know Tok Pisin,

were often called bus kanaka, manabus, or daluoh,           literally a person

from the interior or 'bush', but used derogatorily to mean 'idiot' or

'stupid person' by government officials and those Abu'              and non-Abu'

Tok Pisin speakers because of their lack of knowledge in this language

that came with civilization. Thus certain social attitudes emphasized

the prestige of Tok Pisin to a point where it was seen as the language

of those in power or those in positions of influence. When a language

is regarded by the colonized as part of the culture of the colonizing




     ?This is probably an Ulau-Suain word.
                                                                                                248


power, be it a pidgin or a metropolitan language, the colonized often

came to think that their vernacular is inferior.                          Consequently, they

make efforts to use the external language to achieve                               upward social

mobility       within     the   social    hierarchy        of    the   ruling class.           Thus

prevailing       social     attitudes     increasingly          encourage    the use       of Tok

Pisin at the expense of the local vernacular.

        Interethnic marriages are now more common than in the past and a

number    of    Abu'-speaking adults          have     spouses         from other     ethnic     or

linguistic groups. General indications are that parents of interethnic

marriages do not attempt to teach their children either of their own

mother tongues, but leave their children to acquire Tok Pisin as their

mother tongue. Three of my first cousins have non-Abu1 wives and their

children have learnt Tok Pisin and some English, but they hardly speak

the language of their fathers (Abu') or of their mothers'.                            The three

women     are    fron^ Kiwai       Island,    Dagua        (a   Buki    speaker)     and   a    New

Irelander       (language not known).         Tok Pisin,          Police Motu and English
                   a'


often    become         the mediums      through which          inter-ethnic     communication

takes    place     and     hence    generally       become       the   spoken      languages     of

children of inter-ethnic marriages (cf. Nekitel (l 984)).

        Those   who      leave Abu'      villages     to    attend     schools     or get      jobs

elsewhere in the country either lose command of Abu' or else retain to

varying    degrees a passive             knowledge,        provided     that some     degree of

communicative competence in the vernacular has been acquired prior to

departure from the village. Most of the Abu' speakers who have studied

at the university or who are currently studying there have virtually

abandoned Abu'. One reason is that they may not be competent to speak

Abu', because they had never fully developed a lasting repertoire in

the   vernacular,         and   feel uneasy and ashamed to                use it,     lest they

become objects of ridicule for not knowing their vernacular language

or for speaking it with a strange accent.                        Many Abu'      in town or at
                                                                                         249


university use Tok Pisin or English simply because these are languages

with   which      they   feel    comfortable    or     that    are    spoken    within   the

ethnically mixed contexts in which they live and work.

       When such speakers return to Womsis or other Abu1                       villages for

holidays,      they find it more convenient to use Tok Pisin. When some of

them attempt to speak Abu',            those claiming to be local authorities

make fun of them for speaking it with a foreign accent.                         Given such

attitudes,      the    only option     for   those     unable    to    accept    linguistic

intolerance is to use the language with which they feel comfortable

and which does not invite social stigmatising, fflɑnʒ o? os long absent

from Womsis have little or no opportunity to actively reinforce our

knowledge      of the    vernacular.     On return,       we    find    it   difficult    to

express ourselves in Abu' and therefore communicate through Tok Pisin,

which only serves to give greater support to Tok Pisin at the expense

of Abu'. In general therefore, there is a decrease in the knowledge of

Abu' with long absence from the area where it is spoken.

       There    is also    another social      reason which          contributes towards

this   state of affairs.           Certain social       norms dissuade people from

using a language that visitors do not know unless one wishes to hide

something from them.            To ensure that relationships between visitors,

guests and hosts occur without causing any feelings of suspicion, Abu'

speakers try to avoid using their own vernacular, but will communicate

quite freely in Tok Pisin.           This action indirectly supports the rising

dominance of Tok Pisin over Abu' .

       Finally,       parents   themselves     are    largely    responsible       for   the

apparent decline in status of Abu', especially in Womsis village where

parents were not genuinely concerned about their children acquiring

it. It is usual to see and hear parents speaking to their children in

Tok Pisin.      Further, the establishment of the Womsis community school,

which draws children from different                  language-speaking communities,
                                                                                            250


means that the primary language of communication among the children,

teachers and parents is Tok Pisin and not Abu' or English. These are

some    of   the    social   reasons    which     seem    to     encourage      the    growing

dominance of Tok Pisin among the Abu'.

        Little wonder then that Alibalika (Tok Pisin) is spoken very well

among     the      Abu'.      There    are   no     instances          of     'bush    pidgin'

(cf. Muhlhausler (1975)).          Many of the archaic German-based words,

such as beten ’prayer',         singen 'hymns',          sage 'saw' and

kaiser 'emperor', have been replaced by recent loans from Tok Pisin.

These are pre, singsing or him, so and kin.                Bradshaw (1970:28)

reported that the Numbami still hang on to these German words.                          The Tok

Pisin spoken by Womsis villagers is more                   like     the urban variety.

Recently introduced words from English such as risen 'reason', eksplen

'explain',      kastam 'custom',      asenda 'agenda',          komplen 'complain' have

increasingly become popular not only among those who have had some

English education, but also among the uneducated or semi-educated

resident Womsis Tok Pisin speakers.             These newly introduced Tok Pisin

loans    are used ostentatiously at meetings or public gatherings by the

councillors and other progressive Abu'             to "show off" their skills in

the language. In fact,the closer Tok Pisin is to English, the more it

is preferred by a small but growing number of present day Abu', even

if they do not know the meanings of the highly anglicised words and

phrases they use. It seems that no one really bothers to check on the

effectiveness of communication once new words are used.                          I witnessed

many    defective     communications     resulting       from    the    growing       tendency

among Womsis people          to use new words.       On numerous occasions I was

asked to read and explain a public letter or a memo addressed to the

villHgQrs from government officers in Aitape and when I came across

any highly anglicised          pidgin words such as             those       listed above,    I

substituted them with rural pidgin equivalents (such as as                            for the
                                                                                                  251


urban pidgin risen;             toksave for eksplen;         pasin for kastam;              oɪ poin

bilong    miting        for   asenda    and    belhevi      for    the       urban    pidgin     word

komplen).      For urban pidgin words that do not have any rural pidgin

basilectal equivalents,             I used circumlocutions to                try and convey the

content    of new Tok Pisin            and/or English        loans and          seemed      to have

succeeded in my explanations.

     Radios have also become sources from which Abu' people pick up a

lot of information. Much of this is expressed in an urban variety of

Tok Pisin. Once new anglicised words are heard, they are normally held

onto and used for social prestige and Ao Ke«p abreast w’Ak                                ɪpok pisin

spoken    by     the    elite      and/or    educated      Papua       New   Guineans.         Wider

knowledge of Tok Pisin among the Abu' undermines the prestige it once

had as a link with the European goods and lifestyle.                             It is thus no

longer    regarded       as   it    once    was,   a   language        of the    whiteman dika

duasimiri.         English,        though   not    known    and    spoken by most           of   the

resident       Abu' ,   is now regarded        a language         of    access       to   the urban

lifestyle and a number of pidgin-educated Abu'                          have, on a number of

occasions, expressed the view that they wished they had been educated

in English so they could fully partake in the kind of lifestyle that

those of us who speak English seem to take for granted and, in their

opinion, seem to enjoy.


7.2.2.2 Abu'

     Given       that an      increasing number of children and educated Abu'

            are now relying almost exclusively on Tok Pisin for daily

communication and that Tok Pisin is predominantly used in most speech

situations by Abu'            speakers, the use of Abu'                has declined over the

years. Thus although it is sad to have to recognise this it is a fact

that even though Abu' is the vernacular of the community,                                 it is no
                                                                                             252


longer the primary language of the Abu'.8
                        I
        Some Miye and Aruek also have varying speaking and/or listening

skills in Abu'.          These are mostly people who have ongoing social or

cultural contacts or ties with the Abu'.                   Abu', however, is not spoken

by contiguous Arapesh language groups. The tendency is for each of the

speakers       of genetically      related     Arapesh          languages    to   be   passively

bilingual in each other's language. Thus when an Abu' meets a Muhiang

Arapesh speaker, each would, if they knew each other on a personal

level, address eɑdɑ. oʌv`er        in ʌlne(r   cam<\                In most situations, Tok

Pisin     is     preferred   for   convenience, however,             on     one   occasion   the

author,     his father and a few other men from Womsis and Womsak were

returning from Wewak and had to spend a night at Suparik (see map 2).

Our host,who knew who we were, kept addressing us in both Tok Pisin and

their dialect of Muhiang to which we responded in Abu', thus producing

         Kindi    o? sʌɑɑtion VhaV Lincoln             (1979)    termed "dual-lingualism".

Where we felt our host would not                                  our Arapesh, we used Tok

Pisin.

        Another group which speaks Abu' are foreign resident women who

marry Abu’ men. Women of this category, though they rely on Tok Pisin

for     daily     communication    during      their       initial     residential      period,

gradually learn Abu' and some of them speak it rather fluently, even a

lot better than the Abu'           spoken by many local-born Abu' who did not

acquire the language properly before leaving the Abu'-speaking area.

        Yakopa (a native Kwanga-speaker who took up permanent residence

with her husband in Womsis over 25 years ago) is a good example. She

has achieved a virtual near-native command of the language. Listening




  8Bradshaw (1978:50-31) also reports that Tok Pisin is the primary
language of communication among the Numbami of the Morobe Province and
that their Vernacular--Numbami, plays a subordinate role.       It would
seem therefore, that Tok Pisin is becoming the more important language
of communication not only among the Abu' and Numbami, but probably
other PNG communities as well. (See Nekitel0 984) for further comments).
                                                                                                   253


     to her talking left the author with little doubt that her mastery of

     Abu' phonology, vocabulary, grammar, as well as her knowledge of the

     sociolinguistic rules of appropriate usage, is on a par with that of

     native speakers.           What is said of Yakopa is typical of those foreign

     women who have learned their husbands' language. When Yakopa was asked

     how and why she learnt Abu', she said it was because of her long stay

     in Womsis. She also felt that it was important to know the language in

     order     to     participate       more    meaningfully      and    effectively        in     her

     husband's       community life.          Yakopa's view typifies the            sentiments of

     other foreign women interviewed in Womsis and Welihika.

             There     are     also     short-term        non-Abu'      residents     who        learn

     smatterings of Abu'.             These residents include foreign catechists from

     Lumi and Warapu and foreign language-speaking teachers (from Tumleo,

     Warapu,     Kwanga,       Urat,    Olo,    Ulau-Suain)^ as        well   as    children      and

     overseer parents from Aruek villages. Much of what they learn has to

     do with simple requests, commands, interrogatives and terms for common

     consumer        items   and    traditional    addictives        such as betelnut        (Areca

     catechu), lime, pepper and tobacco, and common vocabulary items such

     as sago, pig, cassowary, water and so on. Most of these were usually

     forgotton soon after they left the area.


     7.2.2.ʒ Miye

             Miye,    the Papuan language spoken slightly south of the Abu', is

     spoken with varying degrees of proficiency by some elders of the Abu'

     villages of Amom and Womsak 1 and 2. It is, however,                      the language of

     Umama,    a small hamlet of Amom             (see map 1).        Residents of Umama are

     descendants of Miye migrants who came to settle there probably before
4»


     western contact.          They have since then maintained social and cultural

     ties     with     their       original    homeland     and   continue     to    pay    strong

     allegiance to their Miye ethnolinguistic id'entity in spite of their

     small number (less than 50 people in 1982) and                      their presence in a
                                                                                 254


predominantly Abu' speaking area. "Tbe cV\\\dr«n o^Umama speak Miye (or Tok

Pisin) as their first language and while some learn to speak Abu', most

of them have a better passive control of Abu’ than speaking ability.

        However, in Womsis knowledge of Miye is restricted to those who

claim ancestral descent from Warn, especially those who have on-going

contact with their resident Warn relatives. The Nubat or dog clansmen

and women (to which I belongɔɑnd their brother-clansmen and women of the

Manduhuf clan are such cases.

        Three of my paternal uncles are married to Miye-speaking wives

and some of their children are bilingual in both Abu' and Miye. My

spouse is also an offspring of an Abu'-Miye marriage.                 She only has

passive knowledge of some Miye, but is a native speaker of Abu1. This

resulted when she had to be sent from Hambini (see map 2)                 to Womsis

when she was two years old in exchange for her mother.

        Parents of the present Manduhuf clansmen and women migrated to

Womsis    from   the Warn villages       of   Selnau and Wandegei     (cf.   Nekitel

1975). Most Abu' who know any Miye do so because they maintain or have

close friend-type ties with the Miye. My knowledge of this language

was picked up from Miye-speaking relatives or from Warn people during

my occasional visits there.           Unfortunately my knowledge of Miye is

resticted to terms for certain food items, domestic utensils, kinship

terms and simple verb phrases such as:              ine ilou'      'you come';   ine

rembi    'you go';     sambeni'   umo sukusukule 'my sister keep quiet'; ɑr`ɪʌ-

simple requests and commands,such as: etihe umo mbelau 'give me sago';

etihe umo mahite 'give me meat'. In the end, we can see that knowledge

of Miye depends, as always, on the social and cultural ties that exist

between     peoples.     These    ties    are    manifested   by     inter-language

marriages,    visits to relatives,        friend-type visits and the cultural

feasts that mark the end the third moulomu' and the fourth kwal grades

of the tambaran ritual cycle. In 1983,for instance, Womsis people were
                                                                                                  255


invited by the Selnau (a Warn village) people to attend the end of the

kwal     tambaran        feast, which        involved      the        display      and    subsequent

distribution        of    pigs,      yams,     coconuts    and        other     food     items among

participants and invited guests.                 On that occasion, though most of the

conversations between             the Miye       and    their guests          were done        in Tok

Pisin, some Womsis girls were unimpressed with the behaviour of some

Selnau    boys who        made unbefitting         remarks in Miye about                  the Womsis

girls who were           there.       The Womsis        girls were        embittered by those

remarks and got angry with those cheeky Selnau boys. They felt it was

unbecoming on the part of the Selnau boys to use their language when

they    (the Womsis girls)            do not know it well enough to respond with

remarks of similar vein.

        Incidently, that was not the first time that members of the Abu'

community complained about the Miye for similar offences. There were

instances in the past where similar views were expressed about Miye

people in general, who often display a condescending attitude towards

their neighbours. Claiming themselves to be founders of the infamous

black magic or sorcery sanguma and having proved that their sorcery is

second to none in the area,                  they capitalized on that reputation to

build an image of cultural arrogance which has been further augmented

by     tambaran      activities.             Having       established         an       attitude    of

ethnocentricism,they justify that undecorous image by showing off Miye

cultural     or     linguistic        arrogance.           This       cultural      arrogance      is

manifested     in        the   way    they     relate     to     or    behave       towards     their

neighbours and the way they literally like to impose their culture and

language on others. The Womsis have thus coined in a vulgarized form

of Miye the       phrase:       lasu lelehe       'inconsiderate          idiots'        to   express

their     dissension from the           Miye     cultural      arrogance.              Historically,

knowledge of Warn sanguma was confined initially to those men who spoke

Miye, and    that        was   the   reason why its knowledge                 and      practice was
                                                                                                     256


    limited     to    Warn   and    to     Abu1    and    those men     of    other    neighbouring

    language     groups       who    spoke Miye.          Nowadays    this   knowledge has          been

    passed on to communities who do not traditionally speak or were not

    known to speak Miye. No information was obtainable about what language

    is used to pass on this Miye sanguma knowledge.                          Rumors have it that

    recent sorcery knowledge is a lot simpler from that of former times.

    One can only guess that Tok Pisin is probably used to transmit some or

    most of the knowledge, and that this knowledge is no longer as complex

    as it was earlier.


    7.2.2.4 Ulau-Suain

          Varying      levels       of receptive and           communicative skills           in    this

    Austronesian language are evident especially among a fair number of

    villagers from Balup, Malin, Aspeis, Walihika, Wolum and Womsis. A few

    have acquired near-native competence in it. Paul Maman of Womsis and

    Mark Melu' of Aspeis are regarded by Ulau-Suain speakers themselves as

    ol   man i       save    tru    long    tokples       Ulau-Suain.    This    is    a    Tok    Pisin

    sentence which means 'thej reaWj Knovi                      Ulau-Suain language F.              Paul

    acquired the language from his Suain host-family and other Suain while

    living with them in Suain No.1                 (Adiman) to attend the Suain community

    school in the 1970s. Mark learnt it from his Ulau wife ɑrvʌ his wife's

    family through regular contact with them.

          Other Abu' who have picked up more than mere smatterings of the

    language are Paul Maman's schoolmates who attended the Suain community

    school.     Unlike       Paul   Maman,        who    had   the   advantage    of       living   and

    interacting on a much more frequent basis, the rest of the grade six

    leavers     (mainly from Womsis and Wolum) were boarders at the Womsis

    camp (located at that time between Suain No.1                       (Adiman) and Suain No.2

    (telap)).    Such social and geographic distancing allowed less direct

    regular contact with the Suain community at large.                           As a result, the

‘   knowledge that the rest of the Womsis and Wolum children picked up is

    not on a par with Paul's linguistic command of Ulau-Suain.
                                                                                                  257


       Most West Sepik Abu' villagers have only a shallow knowledge of

Ulau-Suain.              This    slight      knowledge is     restricted    to     the    kinds    of

linguistic terms or phrases similar to those described above for the

Miye and these are learnt or picked up mainly through social contact.

Much    of       these      social    ties    were    established in      the 1930s when the

Catholic Mission stations at Ulau and Suain were founded.                                 The West

Sepik    Abu'         villages       of Balup,       Malin,   Aspeis,    Welihika,       Wolum and

Womsis have since then been                     under the parochial patronage of this

parish       .    They      often require Catholics from the abovementioned Abu'

villages to go down to one or the other stations (depends on which of

the two is assigned a priest) for the main religious Feast Days,such

as Easter and Christmas.                    It is a serious sin not to attend Mass on

these days. These and other parochial demands foster contact between

the Ulau-Suain and the West Sepik Abu', and they have allowed the latter

to pick up different levels of skills in this language.

        It       is   not     only    parochial       contacts    that   foster     learning      of

Ulau-Suain.            Another fairly influential social                 contact is      one that

revolves around                 social networks,of friends or host-families, who can

be   relied on           to feed      and accommodate visiting friends.                  Generally

speaking, each              Abu'     clan     or     individual    family    has     established

host-families in nearly all the villages along the coast to Aitape

(the administrative centre) who feed and accommodate them when they go

to Aitape.            The physical location of Suain is important,being, as it

were, a gateway to the sea and to the outside world. In this respect,

the Abu' have seen the importance of having cordial relations with the

Suain, and ensuring that friends and host-families are established for

the Abu' to turn to for food and accommodation during their sojourns.

        Furthermore, it was reported orally that there was meagre barter

between the Abu' and Suain mainly on the friend or host-family basis.

The Abu' were said to trade                        yams and tobacco for the Suain salted
                                                                                   258


softwood,which they used to burn to obtain the salted ashes for use in

preparing their food. Seashells,which the Abu value as bridewealth,and

bows and arrows were also traded off or given by the Suain to their

Abu' friends.

       How both parties communicated before Tok Pisin became known in

the area is not known. Nor was I able to obtain a clear view on the

amount of learning of both communities'             languages that probably took

place.      Considering    the    friendly      nature   of   such contacts, it was

possible that some restricted exchange of words or phrases in the two

languages occurred.

       Interethnic marriages between the Abu'             and Suain is uncommon in

spite their regular parochial and friendship ties. Marriages between

the Suain and Abu' are discouraged by parents from both communities

for a number of reasons. The mountainous terrain of the Abu' becomes a

physical barrier and obliges the Abu'              to learn to survive in such a

harsh environment.        This requires the Abu'          to work harder than the

coastal people, who are generally regarded as being lazy by the Abu'.

The geography of the Abu' greatly influences Abu' views and choices on

the quality of wives. Abu' people in general prefer their own or other

bush     communities'   women    to   coastal    ones,   because   they   think   that

coastal women are lazy and weak and cannot endure the tough physical

labour that bush women are accustomed to.                This rationalization also

explains     why Abu'   women in      general do    not prefer coastal marriage

partners.     Less   than a handful      of them     from     Balup and   Wolum have

married Suain men. Children of these marriages that I met and talked

to, do not appear to know any more Abu'             than some Suain people (i.e.

very little). This little knowledge of Abu'               is attributable to these

mixed Abu'-Suain children's general attempt to suppress and eliminate

as much as tbej           ca/\ o? the-ir     ( hillbilly ) inferiority complex,

and this is abetted further by irregular or lack of contact with their
                                                                                                           259


mothers' speech community. Mothers of these mixed Abu'-Suain marriages

do not seem to bother teaching their children Abu' because they too

have     the      "hillbilly"     inferiority complex                   to    overcome       in    order    to

become      more      integrated      into        the        mainstream       Suain        society.      They,

therefore,         emphasize    the    learning              of    their husbands'           language      and

culture at the expense of their own.


7.2.2.5 Aruek

       Nothwithstanding           the geographic                  propinquity of Aruek             to    Abu',

Aruek is little known.             This situation is due in part to the slight

social      and      cultural   contacts          that       exist between          the Abu'        and    the

Aruek.      It is due also to the general negative attitude Abu' people

have towards Aruek people and their language.                                  The language is not

only regarded as difficult grammatically, but is also regarded "bad"

(numehelikeri) because, to Abu' ears, the language sounds like someone

who attempts to talk when his or her mouth is half-filled with water.

These negative attitudes are portrayed or encapsulated in the phrase:

tahalimblel           jelkum—aruek,          an     expression               that     is     not        easily

translatable.          It   implies    that        the       language     is bad,          and hence       not

worthwhile learning and speaking it.

       In      the    foregoing     sections            we     have    examined       in     some       detail

languages that have been or are being learnt (in varying degrees) and

used by the Abu'. Also some preliminary remarks have been made about

the                  reasons that motivated non-Abu' people to want to acquire

knowledge in Abu'. In what follows,we will be describing the way Abu'

people go about learning languages in general.
                                                                                                 260


7.2.J Foreign Language Learning

        There are two basic factors that affect foreign language learning

and use amongst the Abu'. One of these is the method used to learn

those languages and the second the contexts or circumstances in which

foreign languages can be learnt and used.


7.2.3.1 Traditional Foreign Language Learning Method

        The    learning     of other        languages      by     the    adult      Abu'   in    the

traditional Abu' setting is a non-formal                   process which takes place at

any time and within any social setting both outside and within the

Abu'    frontier. There isno evidence of                        Usedlanguage learning of

the     sort used       in the present Womsis           community        ,jðftiol   for learning

English.       The traditional process was simply put as follows:

           "Taim mipela i lainim tokples olsem Miye, ɪnipela i save
       harim man i toktok 0 kolim samting i go pas na mipela i kolim
       bihainim.Olsem sopos em i kolim buai long tokples Miye—em
       , ohumbo bai mipela i kolim bihainim na sopos em i laik tok
       kisim paia i kam, bai em i tok:   etihe umo sutehe na mipela i
       toktok bihainim, olsem tasol na bihain bai mipela i kisim save
       long toktok." .


          When we learn vernaculars such as Miye, we usually listen
       to a person saying something first and then we imitate
       him/her.If, for instance, the tutor utters the word betelnut
       (Areca catechu) or ohumbo in Miye, we will imitate the word
       ohumbo and if he says: 'bring me a fire' [Miye = etihe umo
       sutehe], we imitate him or her likewise.This process is
       continued until we grasp what we are learning.

        That     is, the    Abu'    learn     other languages by listening to                   and

imitating        the speaker of whichever language oneis learning.                         It is a

virtual       rote-learning        process,    involving        the     tutor    saying     a   few

lexical items       and or phrases, and allowing the student to respond in

imitation         of what    is     being     said   until      the linguistic        items     are

mastered,      before                            pvʧɑses     »«<1 viords.       The linguistic

items may be learnt in blocks or as individual words. Since there is




  θJohn Naisoh, Womsis village, 1982
                                                                                                      261


no written tradition,               thia method of course depends heavily on the

willingness of language tutors, as well as on the speech situations in

which learning takes place.

        Speech        situations which         prompt        and    enable     the    Abu'   to     learn

foreign languages are similar to or                          identical with          those described

above.      Because there is no trade system as such,                                the main speech

situations in which learning of foreign languages takes place are social,

cultural or political. Social contexts encompasses a wide spectrum of

activities, such as inter-tribal marriages, friend-type visits, and so

on.     Inter-tribal marriages create situations within which the husband

and wife and their close relatives come together and thus language

learning occurs. The same applies to Abu' who visit non-Abu' friends.

Under these social contacts, language learning is casual.

        In the more formal cultural or political contexts,                              learning of

languages is not usual, and if done, it is restricted to learning for

special purposes, such as learning of a magical formulae in another

language or learning the names of herbs or vines for curing diseases.

Such language learning is done along with the learning of the ritual

act to be learnt.             Other than that,             if the speaker wants to give a

speech     in    a     foreign      language     in    a     formal       cultural     or    political

setting,    he must ensure that he has knowledge of that language well

under control. Formal contexts demands the use of formal speech. This

of course demands that public figures or public speakers learn foreign

languages        to    be    able    to     effectively            influence    the     opinions      of

participants or attendants.

        Womsis       informants emphasize             that    their knowledge           of Miye and

other neighbouring languages is attributable to personal contacts or

friendly associations with native speakers of the languages they know

and speak. Such contacts do not necessarily occur in the locale where

these    languages          are   spoken,      but     also        take    place     away    from    the
                                                                                       262


homeland of the foreign languages in question.                   Several    Womsis men,

including my father, reported that their learning of Miye took place

in plantations in Rabaul in the late 1940s and 1950s when they ended

up with fellow Miye-speaking labourers on the same stations.

        My father, in particular, informed me that his passive knowledge

of Miye was learnt from his Miye workmate (Sigaihe) in the early 1950s

at Makurapau plantation near Kokopo in East New Britain.                   Likewise his

smatterings o? Ulau-Suain were picked up from his fellow Ulau-Suain

leper patients in the       1950s and 1960s at Raihu Leper hospital near

Aitape. He was not the only Abu’ who learnt foreign vernaculars at the

Raihu    Leper hospital.      Other     Abu'      leper patients attributed their

slight knowledge not only             Ulau-Suain and Aruek hot              other ^ɪsʌɑnt

vernaculars as well from their close friends. As a matter of fact,my

presence     with   my   parents   at    Raihu      Leper    hospital    gave    me   the

opportunity to pick up smatterings of a number of vernaculars spoken

in the Aitape (e.g.Valman, Ali, Tumleo anA (*\o\oQ, Lumi (θlo), and Nuku

(Mehek)    districts.     My attendance at St.              Anna community school in

Aitape proved beneficial in so far as learning and reinforcement of my

knowledge of such languages went. Olo and Mehek were spread in Aitape

by a large number of Olo and Mehek labourers                    who   were indentured

to work on the coconut and cacao plantations there since the 1940s.

These     labourers often came       with    their    families    and    relatives, ɑrɪa -\he>|

established homesteads       or camps       all    over   the   Aitape   town and     its

immediate sorrounds.       Their resident Aitape populations expanded and

hence the local Aitape town and its surrounding areas' populations are

outnumbered by these migrants. Being the majority,their languages were

also widely spoken and hence were available for smaller communities to

learn or pick up through constant contact, the                    are. a raknorʤ group,

outnumbered by other larger communities. As such their language is not

spoken broadly and       therefore      does not     become available        for other
                                                                                                           263


speech communities to learn it, except for those immediate neighbours,

such as the Miye and the Aruek who have traditional ties with them.

       The     Abu        are     also very conscious of other people's                        views and

attitudes towards them. Too much indulgence in vernacular use, in the

Abu’    view,        marks       one    out    as   a    buskanaka,       a    Tok    Pisin        term    for

hillbilly.           The     negative attitude            probably reflects an inferiority

complex        that       has      been       nurtured      by     the     prevalent         "hillbilly"

designation that coastal communities in the area have either developed

themselves       or adopted from Europeans                   (especially colonial officers)

and    applied       to    inland communities             such as        the   Abu'.    To     avoid       the

prospect of being regarded as a buskanaka by other people, the Abu'

are always wary of indicators that might lay oneself open to being

identified as a hillbilly.


7.2.4 When are Foreign Languages Spoken?

       Theoretically, foreign languages are spoken or may be spoken at

any time if or when the following considerations are met:­


      - a) there are Abu' speakers who are active and/or passive
        bilinguals in the foreign languages available for use in a
        given speech situation and

      - b) there are foreign language speakers (usually visiting
        friends) and Abu' who speak the language of the visitor.

       Consideration (a) implies that the speakers can be either Abu' to

other Abu'       or       Abu'     to    foreigners if both          groups      know        the    foreign

language,      or if some speak and others only have passive control of

Abu'    and    the foreign language.                In    such instances,            speakers address

each    other     in       Abu'    and    the    given     foreign       language      and    allow        for

passive reception in languages used.                         They may opt            to speak       in Tok

Pisin or in Abu’                during a given speech act, or thej mɑj code switch

among languages they know. Consideration (b) implies that the foreign

language speaker speaks and/or possesses receptive skills in Abu . In

the     case     where           the     foreign        language     speaker-participant                  only
                                                                                                264


understands       but     does     not    speak    Abu',    and     likewise     if    the     ʌbu'

participant^)           only understand        but do(es) not        speak    the   foreigner's

language,    then Tok Pisin predominates.                    It is    also common on such

occasions for the Abu'              speaker-participant and the foreign language

speaker-participant to engage in dual-lingualism as that alluded to

above. Thus,for example, the author's uncle Joseph Ubaim and his Miye

wife engage in this kind of activity.                      Joseph addresses his wife in

Abu', which she understands, and she in turn responds in Miye, which he

understands but does              not appear      to speak       too well.     What    is    being

reported of my uncle and aunt represents in general what a fair number

of   Abu'   and   Miye marriage           partners do       where    both understand           each

other's language.

      The mere presence of a foreign-language visitor-friend also forms

an   occasion       for    Abu'     to    exercise    their       multilingual        skills     in

languages other than their own and may be seen taking place in both

serious     and lighthearted            conversations.      The arrival of          some Womsis

girls and boys at Hambini (a Warn village) to take me and family home

to Womsis in August 1981 created an occasion for my father-in-law to

display his knowledge of Abu', which really surprised me because up

until then he had not spoken any words of Abu'. I lnɑd Taken it ttʌaʌ be. <AuA

not know Abu', so all our conversations were conducted in Tok Pisin and

occasionally some Miye. His Abu' wife [                    m`j    mother-in-lawl had been

influential in my father-in-law's knowledge of Abu'.

      Similar observations were reported by Peter Sutton (1978) in his

sociolinguistic study of a Wik-speaking Australian Aboriginal community

of Western Cape York Peninsula in North Queensland.                          He reports that

"visitor     host       status     is    the   most   salient        variable       determining

dialect-switching"         (p. 164). He further qualified that by saying that

there is substantial evidence of polyglottism when foreign visitors

meet with hosts of a given language, and more so among agnatic and affinal
                                                                                  265


kinsmen than with distant kinsmen where the lingua franca, Wik Munkan,

is used predominantly.

      The Abu' do the same In that they use or attempt to use and learn

the language of the host, if the host is a friend or someone they know,

but   tend     to   resort   to    the   use   of   Tok    Plain    when   addressing

foreign-language-speaking strangers, even if they know what language

the stranger speaks and have some knowledge of his/her language. Until

they get to know about the host, and have established some degree of

friendship, they maintain their social and linguistic distance and use

Tok Pisin on such occasions.

      Our discussion here shows that visitor host status is a salient

determining variable in Abu' and Wik communities and the closer people

are t* each other by marriage or established on-going friendship, the

freer they feel to engage in the use of foreign languages. This practice

differs from that reported of the Hemnesberget townspeople of Norway, who

in "closed network groups" switch dialects less than the "open network

groups"   (Gumperz     1^11). This being the case, it is my emphasis that

among the Abu’ visitor-host status is a salient determining variable

in their use of foreign languages only if there is in existence an

amicable relationship between the visitor and the host.

      Having    discussed    the     social    variables    which    engender   Abu’

multilingualism, we should consider the various contexts in which the

Abu' use foreign, Tok Pisin and the Abu' dialects. This we will do by

way of mapping on a chart the contexts and types of languages used.

Again our presentation is very much influenced by our Womsis data.The

technique adopted at getting at these social contexts is from Hymes

(1968:110).     This involves      getting at    the words whiɔh name        a given

speech event.       Since Abu'     language does not provide precise terms to

describe the numerous speech events, we shall adopt the English terms

to specify them.
                                                                                                                                                          266


7.2.4.1 Recent trends in Abu' use of languages available to them

          An      investigation of uses                               of different                   languages in different

speech situations and for different purposes showed that the pattern

of     usage          is      quite          complicated.                  This        pattern             is       indicated                   by the

following chart in which the following abbreviations are used for the

languages                concerned:                         TP=Tok              Pisin;             MYE=Miye;                      ENG=English;

UL-SU=Ulau-Suain and ARU=Aruek.

            The analysis of recent trends on the language use by the Abu'

will be easily considered if discussed within the framework of the

four sociopolitical domains used in compiling the above chart, namely,

social,             educational, political and cultural.                                                             Before doing that,some

general remarks must be made about the Abu' pattern of

         code-switching vis-a-vis                                          the        contexts                 and         the        types           of social

communities which engender code-taking.

            It was observed                                                   that          code-switching was determined by

sociocultural communities in which an individual plays a part (e.g.

Sankoff (1968:193-19*0 and Bradshaw (1978:3*0).                                                                           After studying

the style-shift among the Numbami, Bradshaw concluded that:




            "The languages available to each Numbami roughly correspond
         to the organizational communities in which she or he plays a
         part. The use of Numbami suggests ties to the village
                                                                                                  268


      community, Yabem, to the church community; Tok Piain, to the
      secular, national community; English, to the urban, elite
      community, with international ties."

        The languages available to each Abu' correspond, as it were, to

the   various organizational                communities in which she                or he    plays a

part.      Consequently,            the pattern (as shown in the chart) is roughly

similar to that reported of the Numbami. The use of Abu' suggests ties

to    traditional            ways     of    life;        other     vernacular        languages     to

neighbouring          speech communities            if   they know       their      languages;    Tok

Pisin,     to    modern organizations               (e.g.    church,      government, business,

etc.)      and the national PNG community at large; and English, to both

national        and     international            English-speaking        communities.            Each

language        is    also    suited       for   whatever        the   concerns     of   each    Abu'

cultural        community.          English would be inadequate for discussion of

traditional aspects of Abu' life. As shown in the above chart, none of

the languages, at least to the extent that any individual knows them,

covers all possibilities with equal facility. Where languages overlap

in      their        expression^ capability,             switching       is    to     some    extent

extemporaneously determined by                    the interlocutors           and the    nature of

topics entertained in a given discourse.                          Where they do not overlap,

the speaker is obliged to switch codes or language to communicate what

s/he wants to say. These general remarks can be seen in more specific

detail in the following paragraphs.


7.2.5.1 Social Domains

         Social domains encompass a number of speech contexts including,

ɪɪɪter     alia.       domestic,        recreational,        entertainment,           arrival     and

departure formulae. All of these formed speech events from which we

goɑged an overview of verbal behaviour at the "macrosociolinguistic"

level in the social domain and the observations w-e.                          made at this level

enhanced our analysis of verbal behaviour at the "microsociolinguistic

level". At the macrosociolinguistic level we observed the pattern of
                                                                                      269


multilingualism,     language switching and so on which aided us in our

detailed     investigation of     "microsociolinguistics"         in   terms    of what

languages     were    used   in    the   different        speech, events, such         as

conversation at      home,   greetings and       farewells,     jokes,    chitchat at

party times, language usage during folk-dances, sport, market and so

on. In all of these speech events, Tok Pisin was used predominantly.

Abu1, though used, is never used as much in the same situations.

     Miye and Ulau-Suain were the only foreign languages used in these

same situations.      Even so,they were used infrequently and usually only

in lighthearted conversations.

     All     languages   listed   were   heard     used    at   one    time    or   other,

especially at arrival        and departure    sessions of Abu'           and   non-Abu'

visitors and were evident particularly during social functions such as

parties, guitar sessions and folk-dances and soon. It should be pointed out

that all folk-dance songs were in Abu', but the conversations that took

place during or outside lulls were conducted in Tok Pisin or Abu' and

infrequently    in Miye and Ulau-Suain.          The choice of these languages

were felt by interlocutors to add a little flavour and variety into

what was virtually a bilingual Tok Pisin-Abu' speech event.

     Stringband      songs were borrowed mainly from Tok Pisin and were

thus sung in that language. A mere handful of them were composed and

sung in Abu' by members of the Womsis Hetek (Keteh spelt in reverse)

Band, which since the sixties has provided a non-traditional form of

social entertainment during party times. Apart from Tok Pisin guitar

songs, the Abu' borrowed Buki songs and scing them in that language or

translated    some of them into      Abu'    and   sang them      in Abu'      to allow

fuller understanding of the content of the songs. Simple English songs

such as "Good night,everybody,how are you?"an<A "John Brown’s body lies
a moulding in the grave"       or a few Motu songs,such as Esi emu ne^ɛ may



 10This is not strictly a Motu song. It was probably taught to the
Motuans by visiting South sea Islander pastors. (Dutton,pers. com.).
                                                                                         270


also be sung often times in their distorted form.                     Since the fifties,

Abu' people adopted and used quite frequently the Buki Arapesh system

of greetings (ɑf. chapt. 3).


7.2.5.2 Educational Domain

        This    domain is     of two    types,    the    traditional and     the modern.

Topics whose subject-matter has to do with such things as traditional

education and/or knowledge and culture are conducted usually in Abu'.

Those     dealing    with     newly    introduced       sociopolitical    and    religious

institutions       were and     are    conducted       virtually    exclusively    in    Tok

Pisin.         Religious    instruction, both written and oral, was               and    is

always in Tok Pisin. There were oral accounts of Abu' being used by

members of the Evangelical Union (a Protestant religious sect) when

conducting services with its followers since they established regular

contact with some Womsak villages in the 1960s, but to what extent is

not known.

        Letter writing has always been in Tok Pisin. Abu' has hardly ever

been used for writing. For one thing, Abu' people have not been taught

a   suitable      alphabet.     When    Abu'     is    used, therefore, writers         have

difficulty       representing     a    number     of    important     phonemes     and, in

particular, the glottal         stop.    Consequently words whose meanings are

differentiated       by the    presence or absence of              the glottal    stop are

often confused. For example, a man writing to his wife and trying to

express his farewell to his wife used the phrase:

    afi-b-i      uwab au ! iyei!
    good-NCE-ATR night no! my gosh! (last two words are exclamatives
                                     denoting refusal and fear
                                     respectively).

        To have been correct he should have said:

    afi-b-i      uwab 'a'u' iye’-i
    good-NCE-ATR night wife 1SG-GEN
    'Good night my wife.1

     The word au' is a negative expression denoting unwillingness.                        It

is important to represent glottal stop to avoid unnecessary confusion
                                                                                      271


that may ɑnse          from written expression in Abu'. For a discussion of

these, see Nekitel (ɔ984^.       In this study the author remarked that if the

glottal stop is not pronounced or written in the Abu' words that have

it, ʌbe. weɑn'ɪngs of sucK words are going to be confused with those do not

have    the    glottal    stop     (especially      with    minimal     pairs).       The

nonexistence of an Abu’ writing system causes the Abu' to write public

notices and letters in Tok Pisin.

       With the introduction of the English medium school in Womsis in

1978, English has been used inside the classroom, while Tok Pisin is

the    language   of   the   playground    and   the    village.       The author was

invited once by one of the           teachers to       sit in and observe how he

conducted his class and the following were my general observations.

The    teacher    commenced      using    English      to   issue     orders   or    give

instructions. Where students appeared to misunderstand or showed signs

of misunderstanding,         the instructor switched to Tok Pisin and then

paraphrased whatever was being said in Tok Pisin into English.                      This,

he informed the observer, was done to try and get his message across

to the students. Though this may have appeared to be a useful way of

assisting students who hardly speak English other than 'yes sir’ or

'no sir' utterances, in so far as its long term effect is concerned,

it was futile. Students appeared lost in the code switching process or

pretended to understand when most of the time they did not.                    Pretence,

one of the students remarked after class, was the best way of pleasing

the teacher.

       Thus although this approach appeared to be successful for dealing

with a concept or two,it was ineffective when longer and more complex

ideas were presented.
                                                                                           272


7.2.5.3 Political Domain

          In the modern Abu' political domain, Tok Piein is undoubtedly the

preferred language.             Political speeches or orders and discussions of

economic projects were and are all expressed in Tok Pisin. Abu' plays

a       subordinate role when such          topics are discussed.            Village court

proceedings are conducted also in Tok Pisin most of the time. Abu' is

resorted to only if defendants misunderstood orders or penalties.                            I

was called for a few times to help clarify some of the Tok Pisin legal

language I knew to the village court magistrate and the village police

before      they took      their turns      in    explaining these      to    some     elderly

people who did. not fully comprehend the meanings of orders and prescribed

penalties.      This I did by replacing those words by their rural pidgin

equivalents, and if there were no rural pidgin equivalents available,

I paraphrased          those new Tok Pisin version of legal concepts in Tok

Pisin or in Abu', depending on which language was suitable.                            It was

particularly interesting to note that as the process of translation

was repeated from one person to another, additions or alterations to

the original wordings were made,                 and in the end the messages became

confused. Because of the apparent confused nature of the translations

caused by the highly anglicised wordings of the village court act, the

accused       readily    accepted    penalties imposed        by   the       village    court

magistrate without properly defending themselves.

    •     In settling land disputes or sorcery accussations, Abu' was used

a lot more than Tok Pisin.            Other vernacular languages were not used

within the domain of modem political life.


7.2.5.4 Cultural Domain

          Activities     that    occurred    within    the   cultural        domain    showed

considerable use of Abu'. For example, oral histories of how different

clans acquired land were often expressed in Abu'                     as      the following

anecdote shows. One day the big men from Womsis, Womsak 1                            and Amom
                                                                                      273


were called together to arbitrate and settle a long-standing feud over

land located in between Womsis, Amom and Womsak No. 2. The arbitration

began at about 8 o'clock at night and went on till 3 o'clock in the

morning of the next day.           Except for restricted interspersing of Tok

Pisin    phrases by   some    of    the   younger men,     the entire        session was

conducted in Abu'.        Abu' was used to keep land right claims from the

Tok Pisin-speaking foreigners who were present at that time.

Abu' was also used to allow the spirits              of   ancestors     to

overhear    what   the     interlocutors      said    about     land   matters

that they were directly        or    indirectly involved in while            they

were still alive.        Tok Pisin    was not used because it would not be

understood by the non-Tok Pisin-speaking spirits.                Foreigners,

particularly neighbours, have no right to know about stories to do

with land demarcation, distribution and ownership, lest they use the

information to lay false claims over disputed land.                Thus the best

course of action is to keep this information secret, and the

best way to do that is to speak in the local vernacular.

        Highly sensitive cultural activities, such as traditional worship

rites,    'secret knowledge' suluh, chants nukuh and magical expressions

naburawa'asi    continue to        be expressed      in Abu'.     The vernacular is

preferred    to Tok Pisin because of the difficulty the ritual experts

have in expressing many of the traditional concepts that Tok Pisin did

not or does not have the equivalents for. Moreover, ritual activities

and   expressions were and          are   directed    to spirits, who,       as   we have

pointed out above, would not understand what is or was being said if

expressed in Tok Pisin.

7.2.6 Language Mixing by the Abu'

       Abu' has, for reasons already mentioned (e.g., contact with many

languages), borrowed a lot from different languages.                                            Most noticeably

in vocabulary, but also in grammar. In this section I will focus                                                       my

attention       on     how        the     Abu'     borrow          foreign           linguistic              elements

(especially      words)           and    how     they make              them    to    fit       into       the       Abu1

language,       thus        increasing           its    lexical           store.           Lexical           borrowing

by     Abu'    from neighbouring                 vernaculars             is less          than        from      Tok

Pisin.        However,        for       limitations           of        length       and    time,

the     integration          of     grammatical          or        syntactic          elements             of

Tok Pisin       and     of        other    vernaculars              in Abu'          is

less     pronounced and thus was not examined in detail.



       Another       area    in which            convergence            is     taking place             is      in    the

"content-form"          (Grace 1978:20)                — the        kinds, of semantic categories

used and the way they are arranged in utterances. Little knowledge of

past     convergence          of        elements       makes        it       virtually           impossible            to

determine      the source           language of some of the lexical                                   items shared

between Upper Abu'            and Miye.            These elements (cf.7.2.1) are totally

integrated       into       both        language       vocabularies.                 The        fairly          similar

grammat,i nal structure between these two languages makes the situation

much more ambiguous.                Both languages are members of the Kombio-Stock

of the Torricelli Language Phylum (Laycock 1973, 1975).


7.2.6.1 Stages of Integration of Abu' with Other Languages

       Haugen        [1956:39-68]          outlines       three          stages       in        the     process        of

integrating      elements of one language                          to    another.          At     the      switching

stage, he says, language boundaries are clear and speakers switch from

one    language to          another at           the word          or phrase          level. At              the next

stage,    there       is     an    overlap        such    that           some    phonetic             or     semantic

elements are assignable to both languages and often,he says, there is
                                                                                                         275


considerable vacillation in the degree of assimilation of elements. At

the     third        stage,       he    says,       the     borrowed        elements       are    virtually

integrated into the language system of the receiving language, usually

by speakers not bilingual in the donor language.

        Abu'    (especially the Upper Abu'                   dialect), Miye and Aruek share a

fair number of related words,but many of them do not form part of the

most    important           basic      vocabulary.          Without        sufficient       knowledge     of

possible        past    convergence            of   the     three     contiguous       Papuan      language

members of the Kombio-Stock of the Torricelli Phylum ( Laycock (l973

and 1975), it is fairly difficult to determine how many of the shared

items result from direct contact among the three languages and how

many     result       from        shared    ancestry.            Virtual         integration of      shared

lexical items into these languages' vocabularies confuses the picture

and is assisted further by the decreasing familiarity with Miye and

Aruek on the part of many young Abu'                             speakers.         General grammatical

similarity among              these        languages does not help either.                       The shared

vocabulary           therefore         could       be     attributed        to     borrowing      from   one

language to another, or, as suggested above, could well be attributed

to shared inheritance,probably from ?roto-Kombio.

        There are fewer than half a dozen loans which are suspected of

being     borrowed           into      Abu1        vocabulary        from        Ulau-Suain.      Clear-cut

examples        are    the        words:     bul        (pl.burkuh)     'pig',      probably      from   the

Ulau-Suain bwuar,which is a possible reflex of PAN *mpRok (cf. Lynch

[1985") and afi'ab 'fire'                  (pl.unih) a possible reflex of PAN *api [cf.

Nekitel [l977) and references therein).

        Others        are     cultural         items       which     are     highly     susceptible       to

borrowing.            In particular two items                    (luw(a/e)        [<Ulau-Suain luwe       'a

container made              out    of black         palm    sheath     for       females    for carrying

things'        and    the word         for bow           keina     (pl.keinab)       [<Ulau-Suain kein

 'bow']. Whether these cultural items were borrowed from the Ulau-Suain
                                                                                                                                                                 276


kθin we cannot be too sure. Total integration of these items into the

Abu' vocabulary makes it hard to determine the donor language. The

Abu'      people always associate both items with the coastal Suain,from

whom they claimed to have learnt the skills of making these two items.

Shown in the table below are examples of some of the vocabulary Abu1

shares with its neghbouring vernacular languages.

7«2.6.2 Phonological Assimilation of Foreign Words

        Abu' being a noun classifying language, foreign loanwords must be

made to fit into the noun class system and thus be made to fit into

the open and closed Abu' syllable pattern. In this respect, loanwords

into    Abu'   fall    into two   phonological categories,        unassimilated and

partially-assimilated. The former is manifested by the singular forms

of loanwords which are borrowed                (usually) wholesale and used in the

language.      The    latter contains     the    pluralized    forms of the foreign

loanwords,taking on the plural suffixes of the noun class the foreign

words become part of (see chapt. ʒ).


7.2.6.3 Tok Pisin Phonology

        Tok Pisin,     for   example,    is well integrated into Abu'.         However

because it is universally known,               most   of its   loans can be readily

recognized.      Phonological distortion of Tok Pisin loans is slight and

characterized mainly by non-phonemic distinction of the phoneme / p /

of Abu' with the Tok Pisin free allophones [p] and [f] such that given

a word like /pater/, it is phonetically realized as Tpater ~ -pater ~

fater] as noted in chapter 5. This interchangeable use of the phones

concerned are not only restricted to the initial position of borrowed

Tok Pisin words.         They are also in free variation in the medial and

final positions as well.

        Mixing of /b/ and /p/ has also been noted, but such interchange

is     sporadic and usually the result of speech defects.              For example,

pope"was heard pronounced by a few Womsis people as [bop,                   oof,bop or

pof].     Most Tok Pisin loans fit perfectly into the Abu' open or closed

syllable pattern as shown in the list below.
                                                                                              278

7.2.6.4 Unnecessary Loanwords

           Abu' people engage in a lot of borrowing from Tok Pisin not only of new
cultural items but also of referentially unnecessary words. This is done when

they find Abu'           inadequate in its expressive capacity, or when they

find       it clumsy.         The Abu'      use Tok Pisin words even when perfectly

suitable Abu' equivalents are available.                    Tok Pisin          merely provides

extra set of synonyms which become readily available for use during

conversations.          It is not easy, therefore, to determine what constitutes

a     genuine loanword.               The   following table   gives some        well-used but

unnecessary loanwords from Tok Pisin.

characterized          by phrases or sentences which usually get drawn into

Abu' utterances.              People may begin an utterance in Abu' and then throw

tried to explain the origin of the development of one of the oratory

styles alluded to in chapter 5 in Tok Pisin. (See kwianif).

       On examination of Tok Pisin loans in Abu', the pattern appears to

fit perfectly with a hypothesis proposed by Bradshaw (1978:39) which

states that:


          "..., there is a direct correlation between degree of
      bilingualism and extent of borrowing. At one end of the scale,
      where bilingualism is restricted (to certain contexts or
      certain speakers), only those items for which no adequate
      equivalents exist in the target language are likely to be
      borrowed. Where bilingualism in both the source language and
      receiving language is universal, almost anything goes— even
      grammatical words."


7.2.6.5 Semantic Expansion

       Influenced     partly     by    Louis     Hjelmslev's    (1961) idee*, e? Ake

"content-form" of lexicon of language, Grace (1978) reasserts a major

distinction between two components of language, namely "content-form"

and   its   "lexification"      (p.20).    In Grace's view, the    "content-form"

comprises    "everything       concerned    in   the   conceptualization   of   the

message, while the second consists just in the pronunciation of words"

 (ibid.).    The content-form not only includes the semantic content of

words b<A ɑlsu incorporates   everything on how the lexicon is organized in

the recipient language system while lexification is mainly concerned

with the semantic content.            Language contacts quite often result in

convergence of linguistic elements from one language to another and

thus create apt contexts from which the two processes are likely to be

seen at work.       As already mentioned, Abu'          being a noun classifying11




   11 Tambaran is metaphorically described as coming down from trees. This
isɑnindireet allusion to tambaran camps*      wVvcX used to be built
 under big trees in well-hidden spots in the forest.
                                                                                                               281


language,        loans     (especially nouns)                    must    automatically          conform with

Abu'     rules of noun classification and thus subject themselves to the

morphosyntactic           rules of the language governing the noun classes the

loans become part of.

         Where there were difficulties in the process of Abu'anization of

certain     foreign concepts,                   the Abu'         are compelled          to coin words to

approximate the meaning of such loan words. In the area of transport

for instance, we note the word /krahu'/ which can mean 'plane', 'car'

or     'ship'. This word indicates that although the concept is foreign

(probably        borrowed from Buki,                      cf.chapt.3),     the constituent elements

and the rules governing their combination are genuinely native.                                                The

constituent elements comprise                             (kr- + hu'}     'rolling sound +              'to move

away/go'. The infixed {—a—} 'has no meaning and is inserted merely to

to break up consonant clusters to lessen constraints on articulation.

Thus krahu'        is conceptualized as a mobile object that emits rolling

sound.       The    Abu'       being        from          inland,    planes were the           first flying

objects they saw and hence named them kralhuwa 'planes'                                          accordingly

and for a while the meaning was restricted only to planes.                                             However,

when they saw cars and ships                              (most notably during the Second World

War).,    they     had     to        find       ways        to      distinguish        each    one      of     the

'automobiles'.             To        do    that       they merely         describe       them     by     way    of

circumlocution, thus                  krahu'          +    iluhu'i      =krahu'    +    sky+GEN         'plane',

krahu'     + itafi'i           = krahu'           +       earth+GEN     'car'     and    krahu'      ausu'i      =

sea+GEN      'ship'.            The        resultant          compound      morphemes         can      thus     be

approximated         to        the        English           'airplane'     (or     'airmobile'),             'car'

('landmobile')           and     'ship'         ('seamobile).           Krahu'     assumes        the    female

gender affix, probably to reflect the Abu' view that an object that

has something to do with bearing or carrying people must by analogy,

be a member of the female gender.                                At the present, most young Abu'

people     prefer        the    use        of   the         Tok Pisin      balus       (or    more     recently
                                                                                               282




(plen), kar and sip, still take the feminine singular and plural

subject prefixes, namely, k^-(sg,) and wa-(pl,).

        There     are    also     loans        whose     semantic        contents    are    being

superimposed,       as    it    were,     on    native     words        that   express     similar

functions       or ideas, thus enabling            the semantic          range of the native

terms to e,/-pɑ,rʌd. ancA ineʌod-e ʌta. meanings           of     the    loans, alongside      the

meanings of existing native words.                     For instance, when the eating or

cutting knife was introduced, the Abu' added its meaning to the native

term for an improvised sharp bamboo strip called nuketefikl used in

pre-contact times for shaving or cutting soft objects. Thus the b O.WX boo

knife was used rather like a razor blade, and in fact that was how

razor blades were called initially. On the other hand, knives used for

eating      or     cutting       have     since        contact     being       called    nuketes

(sg.nuketef).       The same principle applies to                  monetary terms.          Coins

that    the Abu'     saw for the first time must have been visualized as

stones    utaba    (sg.utam), especially white and                  shiny pebbles, and        the

pound or dollar note(s) probably looked like leaves (suus sg.suuf) and

so   they were named:           utam/utaba 'eoin/eoins'            and suuf/suus '(pound)

note(s)'.       Moreover, the introduction of other cultural items such as

knives and calico obliged the Abu'                     to provide referential terms for

them and thus                   eoi^eɑ     alibal (pl.alibakuh) 'knife/knives' and

lufah    (pl.lufokwih)         ’calico/calicos'.                                     Apart from

the possibility of borrowing, these two terms do not seem to have any

clear derivational history within the Abu'                       lexicon and are therefore

regarded as post-contact creations.

        Language mixing discussed above raises a question on whether or '

not there is evidence of loan translation or calquing,                              the process

where the recipient language (i.e. Abu') traces forms and contents of
                                                                                                        283


words onto Tok Pisin loan words.                            In the following short paragraph I

will consider this process.


7.2.7 Loan Translation

        In her discussion of loan translation, Bynon (1977:232) observed

that:


          "..., the choice of constituent morphs and the overall
       meaning of the new constructs will be modelled on the foreign
       source, the constituent elements themselves    and the rules
       governing their combination will be native."



        Loan translation of Tok Pisin words are not readily evident.                                    The

one area in which calquing is apparent is in the system of greetings

where the Tok Pisin form of greetings are translated phrase by phrase

into    equivalent morphemes                    in Abu'.      Such caiques are illustrated in

Abu'     afuhi numunah 'good day'                     and afubi uwab 'good night'.



7-3 Summary

        The present relationships among the languages in which the Abu'

are    multilingual           can    be    visualized         more        plausibly as       a number of

overlapping       circles.          However,          in view of           the   increasing      universal

knowledge        of    Tok     Pisin        and       its    universal        usage     in   most   speech

situations, as          pointed       out       in    (7.1.10)       within and        beyond    the   Abu'

frontier, the learning of other vernacular languages is no longer felt to '

be     a need.        Tok    Pisin        has     overcome         many     communicative       obstacles,

particularly           with     regard           to    cross-cultural            or     cross-linguistic

communication.          It seems          therefore not             an impossible        proposition to

suggest at this juncture that, in the foreseeable future, knowledge of

other    vernaculars           will       diminish,          and     that     the     Abu'   multilingual

situation will alter from overlapping circles to a mere concentric one

where Abu’ will represent the inner-circle, while Tok Pisin occupies the

outer-circle. This, it is presumed, will remain for many years to come,

provided that the Abu' people ensure that their vernacular is passed
                                                                     284


on to their children. However, considering that an increasing number

of Abu' children in Womsis and other Abu'—speaking West Sepik villages

only \KnovJ smatterings o?   the vernacular, and are native speakers of

Tok Pisin, the potential danger of Abu' being reduced, or Worse still

being replaced in its communicative role, is not an impossibility.
