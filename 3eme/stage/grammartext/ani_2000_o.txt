1. Introduction: historical background

   The Khoisan languages are considered the smallest of the four language phyla on the
African continent. Their most prominent feature relates to the sound system: It contains a
large number of ingressive sounds known as clicks which, as a rule, occur word-initially
and are often believed to be remnants of the most ancient sound inventory of human
language. In this respect, research in Khoisan studies has been given much significance
even far beyond the limits of African linguistics.

    The Europeans' momentous lack of judgement towards the languages and cultures o f the
 indigenous inhabitants of southern Africa's Cape region, whom they referred to quite
arbitrarily as "Hottentotzmans" and "Bosjesmans", persisted for nearly 400 years.
Contemporary descriptions and pictures bear witness to the prejudices which served for the
justification of unparalleled campaigns of persecution and annihilation of Khoisan-speaking
 societies. On the search for pastureland for their livestock herds, Dutch frontier farmers
 from the Cape Colony forged ahead deep into the interior o f the subcontinent. In the
 savanna areas, where at that time game still occurred in abundance, they soon came into
 contact with groups of hunters and gatherers they called "Bushmen". Although to the
 Europeans the languages of these Bushmen appeared to be similar to "Hottentot"
 (Khoekhoe) — mainly because of the clicks — , the Bushmen did not, contrary to the Cape
 Hottentots, possess any cattle and were not tribally organised. They were therefore regarded
 as very "primitive", devoid of any culture and religion.

   Bushmen were regarded by the frontier farmers (mostly Trek Boers) merely as rapacious
scoundrels, ripe for extermination. They were denigrated as "Banditti", often driven and
chased like animals, and by as early as the mid-19th century the majority o f these small
hunter-gatherer societies had become extinct. Those who survived the murderous rush were
deported to farms and made forced labour convict. Alongside with the rapid loss of their
cultural identity also the languages of these Cape Bushmen at once disappeared.

   Curiously enough, it was just at the time of nearly complete extinction of the culture and
language of the Cape Bushmen when a serious scientific interest in them set in. At first it
was still believed that, because of the different cultures and economies of the Hottentots
and Bushmen, their languages, too, were strictly to be delimited from one another — all the
more so as Hottentot, in contrast to the Bushman languages of the Cape region known by
then, had a nominal and pronominal gender system. In accordance with the spirit o f the
time, the linguistic feature of grammatical gender distinction was looked at as an expression
of farther advanced cultural forms. As a consequence, "Africa-external origins" o f the
Hottentot language were speculated about and it was strongly believed that the supposedly
"primitive" Bushman foragers had been expelled and driven to retreat areas by the culturally
superior Hottentot cattle-herders.
                                             130

    However, since the knowledge o f Bushman languages o f the Kalahari region — deep
in the subcontinent’s interior— was increasing over time, many of them were found to have
a gender system like Hottentot; thus the view of a strict linguistic distinction between
Bushman and Hottentot became subject to revision. The genealogical relationship o f the
two divisions was recognised and, as a result, the term ’’Khoisari’ was coined to strengthen
relational coherence (cf. Keuthmann & Vossen 1997).


2. Classification

   The concept of Khoisan as a language phylum was further developed and popularised
by Greenberg in 1950 and 1963. His so-called macro-Khoisan hypothesis, which is largely
a result o f lexical comparisons based on the criterion o f resemblance in shape and meaning,
proceeds from the following internal classification: First, a distinction is made between
South African Khoisan (SAK) and the two East African isolates, Hadza and Sandawe. SAK
contains three major branches: Northern, Central, and Southern. Northern Khoisan presents
itself as a dialect cluster consisting o f three or four major units, with a considerable degree
of mutual intelligibility. The Central branch is made up by approximately twenty different
languages and dialects, whereas Southern Khoisan today has virtually one member only
(!X6o dialect cluster). There is every reason, however, to assume that most o f the extinct
SAK languages belonged to that latter branch. Moreover, there is one language (iHoa)
whose position within SAK is still unclear.

   Greenberg's hypothesis has found both adherents (e.g., Argyle 1994; Ehret 1986; Honken
1977, 1988; Ruhlen 1994) and opponents (esp. Westphal 1962, 1971). Given the serious
difficulties to prove genetic relationship between all Khoisan languages, yet a third group
of scholars (e.g., Kbhler 1975, 1981; Sands 1998; Traill 1980, 1986) has directly or
indirectly suggested to use the term "Khoisan" as a cover for all non-Bantu and non-
Cushitic click languages of Africa irrespective of eventual genealogical implications. This
notion was recently taken up by Giildemann & Vossen (in press), who propose the
following pragmatically oriented classification of Khoisan:

 3. Demographic notes

    Today, most of the Khoisan-speaking peoples live above all in the southern African
 republics of Botswana and Namibia; however, some reside in adjacent regions such as
 southern Angola and Zambia, western Zimbabwe, northern South Africa and even Tanzania
 (Hadza, Sandawe isolates). At present, the total population may be estimated to be around
 200,000. While demographic prevision tells us that the Khoisan population is likely to
 increase considerably in number in the next few decades, the majority of Khoisan languages
 will in the long run have little chance to survive in view of the socioeconomic and political
 changes that have taken place in recent years. Several communities have already given up
 their languages in favour of neighbouring Bantu languages.


4. Some major linguistic characteristics

    As mentioned before, Khoisan belongs to the category of click languages, which also
includes some southwestern (Kavango, Yeyi) and southeastern Bantu languages (e.g. Zulu,
Xhosa) as well as the South Cushitic language Dahalo in Kenya. Whereas clicks in Bantu
languages are a result o f borrowing from Khoisan by way o f long-enduring and intensive
contacts, they must be considered a genuine part o f the sound inventories in Khoisan itself.
Five basic types (so-called influxes) of clicks are to be distinguished: bilabial (symbolised
by O), dental (|), alveolar (!), palatal (4), and lateral (||). Each of the five influxes can be
released in various ways (e.g. voiceless, voiced, aspirated, globalised, etc.). This secondary
articulation is called efflux or click accompaniment. Influx and efflux combine to create
click phonemes which make up for lexical differentiation in terms of minimal pairs.

   Although the clicks are a prominent feature of Khoisan languages, they do not constitute
the only, let alone the greatest, difficulty implied in their sound inventories. All Khoisan
lan-guages make use, for instance, of various levels of tone — both lexically and
grammatically. Tone-bearing units are syllabic segments such as vowels and nasal
consonants. The former can occur as oral, nasal, pharyngealised, globalised or breathy
vowels; combinations o f these are also possible.

   The word structure is typically characterised by CVCV, CVV, and CVN sequences. Tri-
and other polysyllabic sequences are very rare and can often be shown to be a result of
influence from Bantu languages.

    Whereas Khoe languages have a rich morphology, Non-Khoe languages (esp. Ju) are a
lot more syntactically oriented. However, all better-known Khoisan languages have a noun
class system which is overt in Khoe and Taa but covert in Ju. The Khoe system is sex-
oriented and formally expressed by means o f combined person-gender-number suffixes.
Three genders (masculine, feminine, common) and numbers (singular, dual, plural) are
distinguished. Word categories depending on the governing noun agree with the latter
                                            132

grammatically. The Ju and Taa systems are semantically nature-oriented; while the Ju
system is morphologically unmarked, Taa nouns are marked by suffixes. There are four
noun classes in Ju and five in Taa. In Ju, class membership can only be detected through
grammatical agreement on certain pronouns. Taa, on the other hand, uses concordial
suffixes to express grammatical agreement.

   The verbal systems o f Khoe languages are complex throughout. Verbal extensions are
very common. They generally serve to alter or modify the meaning o f the basic verb and
in some cases (e.g. passive, intransitive, dative) affect syntactic structures. Tenses and/or
aspects are many, and there are also various ways to express negation in most Khoe
languages. Non-Khoe languages, on the other hand, have a very restricted verbal
morphology and attract notice especially because o f their verb-serialising attitudes.

    In Khoe languages, the dominant word order is S(ubject)-0(bject)-V(erb), although for
reason o f emphasis the object may likewise precede the subject. Nominal qualifiers precede
the noun and adverbial phrases mostly occur sentence-initially. Non-Khoe languages have
a SVO word order with a nominal head-modifier structure (except for associative
constructions). For an up-dated, more detailed overview o f Khoisan languages, the reader
is referred to GUldemann & Vossen (in press).


5. A grammatical sketch of ||Ani

5.1 Introductory remarks

   ||Ani is a member of the western division of Kalahari Khoe. The ||Ani people refer to
them-selves as "||Anikh6e" (lit.: 'riverbank people’); they call their language "||Anid&m." or
"Xuu-khoed&m" {dkm ’tongue1). The ||Anikhoe live in small settlements alongside the upper
course of the Okavango River in northwestern Ngamiland, Botswana: on the east bank
between Mohembo in the north and Seronga in the south, and on the west bank between the
Namibia-Botswana border in the north and the village of Ncamasere in the south. Some
families reside on islands in the Okavango Delta. The number of ||Ani speakers is not
known; my own estimate is around or less than 1,000.

   The present sketch is based on data collected by myself during field trips in 1983-84. My
five informants were elders from a tiny settlement called Qhubuya, some 25 kilometres
south of Shakawe (west bank).

5.2 Phonology

5.2.1 Consonants

   [|Ani has 70 distinctive consonants: 41 (ingressive) clicks and 29 (egressive) clickless
consonants. In addition, five foreign consonant phonemes were noted.

   The click phonemes result from the combination of four influxes with ten effluxes. The
voiced uvular efflux has so far been found only in combination with the lateral influx. The
click inventory of the language presents itself as in Table 1.
                                                 133

   For the clickiess consonants six points (bilabial, alveolar, post-alveolar, velar, uvular,
glottal) and four manners o f articulation (plosive, fricative, nasal, resonant) have been noted
(see Table 2).

   Notes on realisation: is!. Its!, and Idz! tend to be slightly palatalised. Idxi and Idzxl are
realised as [dy] and [dzy], respectively. The phoneme Idl has two allophones: [d\ in word-
initial and [r] in intervocalic position; the latter is mostly realised as [/•].

   Foreign phonemes are Iphl, /If,!mb!, Indf, and hjgf.

5.2.2 Vowels

   There are six oral (/i e e a o uf) and three nasal vowel phonemes (A a u/). Vowel
sequences are very common, the following have been found: ai ae ao a u -o e o e o a - ui ue
u e u a ; s i au - da - ui us. As for the realisation of vowels, see Vossen (1986:340f).

5.2.3 Prosodic elements

   Tonal behaviour complies with the principle of mora which, following Hagman (1977),
1 consider the basic unit o f the phonological structure o f ||Ani (as well as other Khoe
languages). That is to say, lexical morphemes take at least two tones, viz. H(igh) and/or
L(ow). Both mono- and disyllabic word-stems show the tonal sequences HH, HL, and LH.
Only one word was hitherto found to have the sequence LL.

   As KOhler (1981) was able to show for Kxoe, lexical forms with an identical tonal
surface structure fairly often exhibit significant differences in morphotonology. The same
has been observed in ]|Ani, too, particularly with verbs, where the sequences HH and LH
can each be subdivided into two tonal classes. Thus, altogether five tone classes can be
distinguished at the present stage of research. These occur among both mono- and
disyllabic verbs whose finite forms show identical tonemic patterns (see Vossen 1997:
178ff).

    It should also be mentioned that the tonal behaviour o f ||Ani verbs appears to be
influenced by stress. For details see Vossen (1986: 343). However, whether or not stress
is phonological ly distinctive remains to be further investigated.

5.3 Word structure andphonotaxis

 5.3.1 Words and roots

     ||Ani has simple and complex words. Simple words are, as a rule, identical with roots;
 complex words can be a result of stem-extension, reduplication or composition. Stem-
 extension on nouns (N) is expressed by person-gender-number (PGN) suffixes, whereas
 verbal (V) extension is achieved through derivative suffixes which trigger semantic and
 sometimes also syntactic changes on the basic verb. Reduplication o f nominal stems is
 relatively rare and normally leads to semantic alteration o f the simple form; the latter is
 often not attested as such. Reduplication o f the verb gives rise throughout to repetitive or
 causative function. Most nominal compounds have the structure N-N, while verbal
 compounds can occur as V-N, N-V and V-V sequences. Cf. the following examples (Table
 3):

'wildebeest; 54.4 %), CVCV (e.g. ||xuni 'blunf; 32.7 %), and CVN (e.g. |dm 'sun'; 32.7 %);
other — much less frequent — sequences are CVCVCV (e.g. 'erikit 'dog'; 2.7 %) and
CVCVCVCV (e.g. \oagagctra 'to lie on one's back1; 0.1 %) (cf. Vossen 1986: 324).

5.3.2 Syllable structure

   Open syllables outweigh closed ones clearly. In general, they have the following
structural sequences: CVV in monosyllabic and CV in di- or polysyllabic words. Close
syllables always end with a nasal consonant, they never co-occur with other syllables; i.e.,
the CVN structure is confined to monosyllabic roots. The same applies to CVV syllables.

5.3.3 Phonotaxis

   The following general statements can be made; Clicks occur root-initially only. By far
the most frequent vowels in V,-position are !a o ui (in CVV, CVN, and CVCV sequences),
but also fe £ if occur in this position (except in CVN roots). Nasal vowels are restricted to
CVV roots. In V3-position (of CVCV roots) fi a! prevail, though other oral vowels are also
found there.

   In vowel sequences of disyllabic words, vowels of identical quality are attested for all
oral vowels, whereby la o ni once again predominate (as aCa. oCo. uCu). Other common
combi-nations are aCi and uCi, less frequent are aCu and aCe.

   In C2-position the most commonly found consonants are Jb dm nf. All other consonants
are extremely rare.

5.4 Morphology*

5.4.1 The noun

   The morphology of the noun is characterised by three structural slots: 1 root - 2 PGN
suffix - 3 object suffix. The only slot to be filled obligatorily is 1,2 and 3 being optional
or obligatory under certain conditions.
                                             136

  5.4.1.1 The PGN system

  The PGN system discriminates three genders (masculine, feminine, common) and three
numbers (singular, dual, plural). Gender and number express themselves in a single suffix.
The common gender contains the features [masculine + feminine] and can, therefore, not
appear in the singular. A given governing noun's gender determines the grammatical
agreement on its dependent word categories. These are adjectives, numerals,
demonstratives, possessives, and nominalised finite verbs as stand-ins of relative
constructions. However, this grammatical congruence seems to be both, optional to some
extent and obligatory under certain conditions. Thus a noun may be unmarked for gender
while, for instance, a demonstrative belonging to it is marked, and vice versa.

   The use of the PGN suffixes equally applies to animate and inanimate nouns. If a noun
has the feature [animate], the PGN suffix expresses natural sex, e.g. khoe.ma ’man1, khoe.ht
’woman’ (khoe ’person'). If, in contrast to this, a noun has the feature [inanimate], then the
choice by the speaker of a PGN suffix is more or less arbitrary. The PGN suffixes of j|Ani
are the following (Table 4):

   Table 4: The nominal PGN suffixes.

                        SINGULAR                 DUAL                    PLURAL


 MASCULINE               .m a                    .ts&                    ■m
 FEMININE                .he                     .sa                     .dzi
 COMMON                 —                          .k h u a              .n&

    The vowel a of the masculine singular and common plural suffixes is sometimes elided.

    5.4.1.2 Nominal object marking

    No inflectional case marking exists in ||Ani, but the language has both syntactical and
 morphological means to represent subject-object relations. Morphological marking is
 possible, but not obligatory, on nominal objects only in which case the morpheme. 'a is
 suffixed either directly to the noun or — if the noun is marked for gender and number —
 to the PGN suffix.

    5.4.1.3 Associative particle di

    The structural element di is used to form possessive constructions. Its place in the
 genitival phrase depends on the order of nomen rectum and nomen regens. If the governing
 noun follows the governed (rectum regens'), the particle is placed between the two. It may,
 but need not, take a PGN agreement marker depending on the gender and number o f the
 governing noun, e.g. \od d im \x££.m& 'child’s body'. If the governing noun precedes the
 governed {regens rectum), the associative particle is placed after the latter and is, as a rule,
 marked for gender and number.
                                              137

5.4.2 Pronouns

    5.4.2.1 Subject and object

   The nominal gender and number distinctions (cf. 5.4.1.1) are also expressed in the
pronominal subject and object paradigms. Object pronouns are mostly suffixed by the
object marker .'a (cf. 5.4.1.2), but there is also a tonal difference between subjects and
objects. Whereas subject pronouns (except 3rd persons and 2nd person feminine dual) are
characterised by high tone, object pronouns have a high-low pattern throughout which
extends over the whole pronominal form including the object marker. 'a. An additional
phenomenon on object pronouns is the insertion of the vowel e or a between the pronoun
and the object suffix, e.g. ||dd '2mpr (subject) as against ||add. 'd (object).

   A peculiarity of ||Ani is to be seen in a set of object concord markers encoded in the
finite verb (cf. Vossen 1985), which for the larger part are segmentally identical with the
subject pronouns and bear low tone throughout. In the 2nd persons singular and the 3rd
person feminine singular the final vowel a of the subject pronoun changes to i in its
corresponding concord form. A morphological change between subject/object and concord
form is observed in the 2nd and 3rd persons singular. The selfstanding pronouns are
represented in Table 5.

   5.4.2.2 Demonstratives

   At least four categories o f demonstrative pronouns with different deictic features have
so far been found. If, during the speech act, speaker and addressee are present (and thus
visible), n\ne ('this’) denotes the near (the deictic feature being [near speaker]) and n\ne=tb
the far referent (i.e., [far addressee]). Purely referentialiy used is 'a ('that one mentioned
before'); it implies that the referent is invisible during the utterance. A higher degree o f
distance finds expression in the form ’d-te ('that yonder1), which by means of the adverb
'aka 'far' can be extended to shape 'd-aka=te (with the same meaning). Both forms imply
that the referent is far away from, and yet visible by, the speaker.

    In my JjAni data, noun and demonstrative agree with each other morphologically in more
than 90 percent o f cases. The nominal PGN suffixes also function as agreement markers,
whereby the masculine singular and plural suffixes md and .\\iid. respectively, as well as
the common plural suffix.on appear as ./n / ,\\ii / .n. For the feminine singular .W an d .sfi)
can be used alternatively. Examples: n\ne.si khoe.hk ’this woman', n\ne=te.m xdm.ma 'that
lion', ’a(=dkd) =/<?.dzi khoe.dk} 'those (absent) women1, 'd.\\v khoe.\\ud 'those men (referred
to earlier)'.

     5.4.2.3 Possessives

    As a morphological category possessive pronouns do not exist in ||Ani. Two types of
construction are possible to express possessive or associative relations: (1) juxtaposition
of per-sonal pronoun (or a form derived therefrom) and noun referent, and (2) use o f the
associative particle di (cf. 5.4.1.3) which always follows the pronoun. The sequence
pronoun+rf/ can then be placed either before or after the noun referent An essential feature
o f type (2) constructions is morphological agreement between the associative particle and
the noun referent, which seems sometimes optional, sometimes obligatory; obligatory
marking is syntactically conditioned. Again, the PGN suffixes are used as agreement
markers. Example:

     ti             di      titu.hk            or           ti dih£ luu.hi:   or   *uu ti diht
     PRO, l s g     POSS    head.P G N /3fsg
     'my head'
                                             139

    The associative particle can, but need not, be omitted in constructions relating to kinship
terminology as the following example shows: 'd~d (di) ddmasihe'her younger sister'. Here
.si occurs in the 3rd person feminine singular pronoun as allomorph o f .hi.

   5.4.2.4 Interrogatives

   The following three have been noted: ma 'who?', ne ’what?', and m 'which, what?'. They
can all be used in the formation o f further interrogatives, but only ma is prepared to take
an agreement marker. Examples:

n\ne.m          kx'ad~khde .ma        md     .md?      'Who is this man?’
DEM .3m sg      mal e=*person .3msg   who    .3msg

n\ne.ma         ne ?                                   'What is this?'
DEM.3msg        this

tsd             nd                    n\\nda.td ?      'What did you say?'
PR0.2msg        what                  say    .PAST

      In associative constructions ma 'who?* behaves like a subject pronoun:

n\m .n       kho6-n\\ndb6.nd     md di?      'Whose shoes are these?'
DEM.3cpl skin-shoe         .3cpl who POSS

  When ma 'who?' is employed as an object, it takes the object suffix. ’a (cf. 5.4.1.2), e.g.
md. ’a ’whom?'.

5.4.3 The verb

   Non-finite verbs in ||Ani are identical with the verbal root. They represent both the
infinitive and the imperative, depending on the context. The segmental order of
morphological elements encoded in the finite verb comprises five structural slots: 1 root
(base form) - 2 derivative extension - 3 {juncture / passive / object concord marker} - 4
tense - 5 negation. Obligatorily to be filled are slots 1, 3, and 4, slots 2 and 5 being
optional.

   Derivative verbal extensions (slot 2) often show up combined (see below). In my data
basis a maximum of five different derivative suffixes in the same finite verb form are
attested. The filling of slot 3 occurs facultatively in the sense that only one o f the three
morphemes can take that position. Statistically speaking, the juncture prevails. It links the
tense marker to the verba] base and appears in various morphological forms which are
subject to allomorphic rules. The juncture represents "active mood"; if a verb is used in a
passive meaning, the passive morpheme .e replaces the juncture. When a nominal or
pronominal object forms part o f the sentence structure, this object as a rule reoccurs in the
finite verb in the shape of an agreement marker (cf. 5,4.2.1) on the condition that the object
is marked for gender and number (cf. Vossen 1985). In this case the concord marker fills
the slot. Examples:
                                                             140

     'Do you see my house?'

     5.4,3.1     Derivative verbal extensions (slot 2)

   There are more than ten derivative suffixes with diverse functions whose productivity
ranges from "slight" to "high". Little productive appear to be, e.g., inclinative and sociative-
comitative; in contrast to this, reflexive, causative I, dative, and reciprocal tend to be highly
productive. Some verbal extensions show considerable degrees of semantic variability.
Table 6 gives an overview of the derivative extensions of ||Ani.

    The morpheme .kd (causative I) can also Imply an instrumental meaning, e.g. kde.kd 'tie
with s.th.* (kde 'tie'). It is presently not known whether we are dealing here with a single
formative or with two morphemes deriving historically from different sources. Furthermore,
the sociative-comitatlve fonnative. \xdd also functions as a postposition ('together with1),
and the directive-locative morpheme. 'd is often employed in nominal contexts, e.g. \\oe. 'd
'sleeping-place, bed' (|joe 'lie down'; cf. Vossen 1998).

       5.43.2 Juncture (slot 3)

   The general conditions for the occurrence of the juncture have already been touched
upon very briefly in 5.4.3. Its concrete shape depends on the tense marker employed on the
one hand, and on its phonological structure and environment on the other:
  (i) In the present, habitual, and ingress!ve tenses the juncture base lal is replaced by
         a zero morpheme.
   (ii) In future tense the base is retained.
   (iii) In all other tenses (past) the juncture base is either retained or replaced by an allo-
         morph whose shape is determined by the word structure and phonological form o f
         the verb. The following examples illustrate cases (i) and (ii):
                    CVV                                    GVCV

(0       present    fif.te          *sing(s)'              \xuru. le             'vibrate(s)'
         habitual   fdo.j \de       'use(s) to pound'      xuml.\\di             '... snore'
         ingressive pee.n 4nita     'about to jum p'       n\\ndni.nJnm          ’... build'

(ii)     future     \ii.a.gde(ne)   'will/sliall sing'     (xuru.d.gde(m)             vibrate'
                    tdo.d.gde(ne)   'will/shall pound'     xunu.d.gae(m)         '... snore'
                    pee.a.gde(m)    'will/shall jum p'     n\\ndni.a.gd&(ne)          build’

   If (iii) applies, word structure represents the primary and phonological form the
secondary cri-terion for the choice o f the juncture form. Whereas di- and other polysyllabic
verbs take on the allomorph .na, monosyllabic verbs receive an allomorph whose shape is
phonologically conditioned. The juncture base is normally retained when the verb ends in
a high or low vow-el. It also appears on verbs with a CVN structure. Examples:

    b.      monosyllabic verbs ending in a high or low vowel

     past (recent I)   \u.d.ta               'sang (this morning)’
                       suu.a.ta              'hasted
     past (recent II) had. d. 11'dm          ’wanted (some days ago)’
     past (remote)     Idla.hii              'was healthy (long ago)1
     past (indefinite) dzuAhad               'skimmed off
                        ts'dd.a.haa          'stole'

    c.      monosyllabic verbs ending in a nasal consonant (CVN)

     past (recent II)     tan. d. | | 'dm       'stood up'

  Verbs ending in a mid-vowel totally assimilate the juncture base. Two types of
construction must be distinguished here: assimilation with and without the insertion o f r.
Examples:

    d.      monosyllabic verbs ending in a mid-vowel

     |i oe.e.td      'slept'                pie.re.had         'jumped'
     tsJ.hu          'stood'                kx'tri.\\'dm       'cried'
     tad.o.td        'pounded'              kx'd.rd.ta         'ate meat'

    The insertion o f r is neither phonologically nor morphologically motivated but, rather,
historically founded (cf, Vossen 1997). Interestingly enough, also some of the verbs ending
in a low vowel — be it oral or nasal — insert r (or n) in the juncture slot and, thus, do not
fall under case (iii.b), e.g.: *qda 'slap' > *qaa.rd.had ’slapped'; sad 'rest' > sd.nd.\\'dm
'rested'. In other words, certain verbs ending in a are in the past tense not followed by the
juncture base .a but by its allomorph ,ra\ similarly, certain verbs ending in d do not take on
the juncture base .a but rather the allomorph. na in which case the nasality of the vowel gets
 lost.

   5,4.3.3 Object concord marker (slot 3)

  As pointed out before (cf. 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.3), the object concord formative is marked for
PGN; it refers to nominal or pronominal objects. Examples:

   (i) nominal object
     \dm.tsd       !'ui     .tsd       ti        muu.tsa     .ta.
     tw o.3m du leopard.3mdu P R O .lsg see ,3mdu.PAST
     'This morning 1 saw a pair o f leopards.1

   (ii) pronominal object
      til           tsd              m uatlte
      PRO.lsg PR0.2msg               see.lsg.PRES
     'You (m/sg) see me.'
                                               143

    5.43.4 Tense (slot 4)

   The following tenses have been noted (Table 7):

    Table 7: The tense markers.

                                 RECENT I        RECENT II        REMOTE          INDEFINITE
 PRESENT        .te
 INGRESSIVE     .n ^ n u i
 HABITUAL       .|[oe
 PAST                            .ta             .||'om           .hit            .h&a
 FUTURE         .goe(nfe)

    The present, ingressive, and habitual suffixes can clearly be shown to be derived from
the verbs for ’stand', 'sit', and 'lie (down)' respectively. These verbs are still used as such
frequently. The label "ingressive" is employed here with some reservation. The formative
nfnita indicates that an action is or was about to be carried out. Like the habitual marker
.\\de it is not restricted to the present. While normally ingressive and habitual are
considered as aspects, in ||Ani they morphologically behave precisely like tenses, fill the
slot for tense markers and, to my knowledge, do not combine with any aspect markers.

   The past tenses may be commented on as follows: The remote past formative M l signals
that an action took place in the distant past. It is used predominantly in tales and stories and,
thus, fulfils a narrative function. The suffix .}|'dm (recent past II) is employed for events
that happened a few days ago or just the day before, while .ta refers to 'morning of the same
day'. The formative .had causes some problems as, to this day, it can neither be assigned
to a particular stage in the past nor defined otherwise. The label "indefinite past" must
therefore be regarded as preliminary.

   5.43.5 Negation (slot 5)

   Apart from the stem negation marker .gaa, which is a derivative suffix (see 5.43.1
above) negating the verb base as such, there is only one other negative formative, viz.
.M(e)\ it turns the verbal construction as a whole into the negative.

5.5 Syntactic features

   Generally speaking, coordination prevails over subordination. A good example appears
to be the formation o f "relative clauses" such as the following:

nfne.m        khoe .ma       || uru-biye   \x'Gu.a        .\\'dm.ma      kx'ao-khoe      (data*
DEM.3msg person .3msg bush-horse kill .JUNC.PAST3msg mate=person real
  'This man who (a few days ago) killed a zebra (is) a real man.' * (< Setswana)

   In this phrase the "relative clause" is placed between the subject ('this man') and the
complement ('real man') of the non-verbal predicate ('is'), which itself is not formally
expressed. The "relative clause" consists o f an unmarked nominal object ('zebra') which is
                                             144

followed by the verb that it relates to. This verb is nominalised in its finite form by means
of a PGN marker that is in grammatical agreement (m/sg) with the subject o f the phrase.

   The dominant word order is SOV but for reason of, e.g., emphasis OSV is also possible
(see examples in S.4.3.3). Nominal qualifiers such as adjectives, numerals, and
demonstratives precede the noun. Possessives may either precede or follow the noun
referent. In nominal possessive constructions the order is rectum regens. A copula does
virtually not exist. In adjectival predication, for instance, the adjective is placed alter the
subject and no copulative element to express 'is/are' is made use of. Postpositions, rather
than prepositions, are employed as adpositions. Adverbial phrases are mostly placed at the
beginning of a sentence, though sentence-final occurrence is also not uncommon.
