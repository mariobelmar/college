Summary

This thesis is a description of the complex sentences in the Abun language of
lrian Jaya, Indonesia. It is a companion work to the thesis by K.Berry entitled
A Description of the Abun Language - phonology and basic morpho-syntax.


In the introductory chapter a brief description is given of basic Abun
phonology, morphology, and syntax. Abun is an isolating language in which
particles and word order are the principal syntactic devices.


In the second chapter relative clauses are discussed including relative clause
formation strategy and the various relative clause types. The third chapter
discusses sentential complementation. Complement clauses can be either
marked by a complementizer or unmarked. For those that are unmarked,
various means of identifying clause embedding are presented.


The final two chapters describe clauses traditionally referred to as adverbial
subordinate clauses. Here it is shown how Abun complex sentences do not
fit neatly into a traditional subordinateicoordinate subdivision.       Certain
features of Papuan clause chaining languages can be found in these
sentence types. Abun 'adverbial' clauses can be divided into four types
depending on the type of conjunction within the complex sentence. These
conjunctions   are   postpositional   terriporal   conjunctions,   prepositional
conjunctions, compound conjunctions and negative conjunctions.

This thesis would not have been possible without the untiring support and
patience of my family. In particular I would like to thank my husband. Keith.
for his help and many suggestions which have contributed to this work.


I would also like to acknowledge the help of my supervisors. Dr Barry Blake
and Dr Graham Scott. I would especially like to thank Dr Barry Blake for his
wisdom and advice in directing my efforts.


Finally, I wish to thank many of the Abun speaking people who graciously
allowed us to live among them and learn their language. They helped us in so
many ways. There are too many to name individually , but specifically I would
like to thank Niko Yeblo, Nelwan Yeblo, lsak Yekese and Yemina Yesawen.
Without their patience and help I would never have learned to speak the
Abun language.
      Introduction

This thesis is a description of the complex sentences of the Abun language of
lrian Jaya, Indonesia. The fieldwork for this thesis was undertaken during a
period of several years ranging from 1987 to 1992 when the author lived
amongst the Abun speaking people.             This fieldwork was undertaken in
conjunction with the author's husband, Keith Berry, who has produced a
companion thesis describing the phonology and basic clause morpho-syntax of
the Abun language. Therefore various elements of Abun grammar are only
briefly referred to in this thesis because they are outlined in greater detail in the
work of Keith Berry (1995).



1.1 Location of villages and dialects

The Abun language is spoken in lrian Jaya, Indonesia, in the northern area of
the Bird's Head Peninsula.      The language is spoken in the governmental
subdistricts of Sausapor and Mega. It is bordered by the Mpur (also known as
Kebar or Amberbaken) language to the east; the Karon Dori (also known as
Mare) dialect of Mai Brat to the south and the Moi language to the west. There

are approximately three thousand speakers who live in sixteen villages as well
as in isolated hamlets, as in map 1.



There are four identifiable dialects all of which are mutually intelligible, although
intelligibility decreases when greater geographic distance is involved.                    The

names given to the dialects are those used by the speakers themselves and
concern the different terms for the first person singular pronoun.

in their respective phonemic systems.



1.2 Background

1.2.1 The name of the language-Abun

Abun is the name through which the people of the area refer to their own

language,- a means 'language', and bun means 'bush, jungle'. They refer to


' ~ h e s efigures are from the surveys published in Berry and Berry (1987.59)
                                                                              Abun Introduction 3



    themselves as the Yenden people, ye- meaning 'person' and nden 'interior,
    land'. Sometimes they refer to the name of their language as Anden, but Abun
    is the most common and widespread term.                    On rare occasions they call
j
    themselves the Yembun people; however the people say they are the Yenden
i
i
!   people, and that they speak the Abun ianguage.



    I.2.2 History

    The Abun language has been known by various other names including Karon
    Pantai, Madik and Yimbun. It's first recorded name was Karon Pantai. This
    name is the one listed in Vwrhoeve (1975:48), and is also the name used by
    the Dutch in writings such as the journal of Reverend F. Kamma who visited the
    area in 1934 and any writings of the Dutch colonial administrators.* Karon was
    the name given to the Abun speaking people by the Biak people, immigrants to
    the area from the island of Biak which is to the north. The Moi people to the
    west call them Madik, the meaning of which is uncertain. Voorhoeve (197548)
    listed the name Madik as a separate language for what has since been analysed

                          MAP2 ABUN AND SURROUNDING LANGUAGES




    *I am Indebted to Bert Voorhoeve who acquired the journal of Reverend Kamma for me from
    the library of ANU and also to IUr J. Dykstra who translated it into English. Various other
    writings of the Dutch Colonial period are only available in Dutch and therefore I have not been
    able to make use of them.

as the Abun Ji dialect (Berry & Berry 1987). The Amberbaken (also called the
Kebar and Mpur) to the east call them the Yimbun, or Yembun, a name which
they obviously acquired from the Yenden themselves. This name is commonly
used at the western end of the language group.


The Biak name for the Yenden relates to the first contact between the two
groups. The Biak people arrived from the island of Biak near the end of the
nineteenth century and settled along the north coast of the Bird's Head of lrian
Jaya, as shown in the map above. Their initial contact with the Abun speaking
people was rather unusual. Some of the Biaks, after landing their canoes on the
coast, found several Abun speaking people with maggots smeared over their
bodies. The Abun speaking people hoped through this attempt at feigning death
that the Biaks would leave their area. But the Biaks soon discovered that they
were still alive. As a result, they used the Biak term, Karon, meaning 'maggot
eaten body'. Later a further distinction was made between those who lived near
the coast and those who lived on the Tamrau ranges, with the addition of the
Indonesian words pantai 'coast' and gunung 'mountain'. So the Biak people
called them Karon Pantai.       The mountain group, who speak a different
language, they named Karon Gunung (listed as Karon Dori by Voorhoeve
1975:48).



It was a common practice for the Biak tribe to denote neighbouring tribes with
derogatory names.      The tribe to the east the Biaks referred to as the
'Amberbaken', literally the 'strange bodies'. These people who live in the Kebar
valley refer to their language as Mpur. A tribe further to the east again the Biaks
referred to as the 'Manikion' (sometimes spelt as Manichion). This means 'dregs
of the oil'. This tribe is now referred to as the Soub. In colonial times the Biak
tribe were promoted by the Dutch who advanced them in their education both

locally in Dutch New Guinea (as lrian Jaya was then known) and in Holland. For
                                                                   Abun Introduction 5



this reason these derogatory names have come into written use either in
linguistic articles or in administrative documents.


For many years the Abun speaking people did not move out of their tribal
homelands except for war, on slave raiding parties or to exchange certain
goods, in particular the cloth referred to throughout the entire Bird's Head region
as kain timur 'eastern cloth'. Even today the majority of Abun speakers have not
left their tribal area and have not ventured out to the Indonesian towns. Prior to
the incorporation of lrian Jaya into Indonesia in 1963 there were only two
documented visits by non-lrianese to the interior of the Abun speaking area -
that of Reverend Kamma and another by an Ambonese man in an official
capacity. This lack of 'outside contact' was most likely due to the fact that the
Abun still practiced cannibalism.


Therefore in the closest major town, Sorong, the Biak name Karon or Karon
Pantai is still used to refer to this people.     Because it is the only name
understood by outsiders (those who are not Abun speakers), Abun speaking
people will often refer to themselves as Karron when talking to outsiders. Even
so, Abun speaking people do not like the name Karon because of its derogatory
connotations.   The name, Abun, has now been introduced into linguistic
literature by Silzer & Clouse (1991) and Grimes (1992). This thesis will use
Abun as the name for the language spoken by the Yenden people.



1.3 Linguistic overview

1.3.1 Classification of the Abun language

The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206). It

belongs to the small West Papuan Phylum.              It is part of the Bird's Head
Superstock, the Central Bird's Head Stock, and more specifically the North
                                                                        Abun Introduction 6



Bird's Head Family, of which Abun and Madik are listed as members. While
Wurm listed Abun (Karon Pantai) and Madik as separate languages, Berry 8
Berry (1987) have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and
structural similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the
same language.        Berry and Berry calculated over eighty per cent lexical
similarity between Madik and Karon Pantai.               Further data and information
obtained since that time indicate identical syntactic patterns. There are some
phonological differences but not enough to hinder mutual intelligibility. What has
formerly been known as the Madik language has been reclassified as part of the
Abun Ji dialect.3 The language fomerfy known as Karon Pantai has been
reclassified as Abun, since Karon Pantai was used to cover a wide area which
included all the Abun dialects. Therefore Abun is a family level isolate in the
Central Bird's Head Stock.



I.3.2 Papuan versus Austronesian features of the Abun language

Wurm's classification of Abun as a language of Papuan type seems to be based
mainly on its lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal
pronouns. There are a considerable number of Austronesian loanwords in the
West Papuan Phylum (WPP) languages. WPP languages in the Bird's Head
also contain a small Trans-New Guinea Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the
TNG Phylum), or maybe traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm
1982:204). The personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set
Ill (Wurm 1982:40), see Table 2 below.              Abun personal pronouns do not
distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive, a Papuan
feature.   Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no

3 ~ h Abun
      e     Ji dialect which is numerically the largest can be broken down into two further
dialects. The author has not had the opportunity to research this further as the speakers of
these dialects live in remote areas that can only be reached by trekking or by helicopter.
                                                                        Abun Introduction 7



bound subject markers on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-
realis (or non-pastlpast) distinction which is marked only on complex sentences.
Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of Abun syntax are found at the level
of the complex sentence, the subject of this thesis. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which
could be considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate.
This lack of subordinatelcoordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-
chaining languages.        Likewise, in Papuan clause-chaining languages the
semantic notions of temporal sequence and simultaneity are strongly marked
(Longacre 1985264). These notions also feature strongly in Abun complex
sentences.


                              TABLE2 ABUNPRONOUNS
       Dialect variants of Abun pronouns are represented in the following way: ninhu


              Person                 singular                     plural


          1                ji&e&at        'I'           men            'we'

       2                   nan/a          'you'         nin/nu         'you'

       3                   an             'heishe'      an             'they'

       3f                  mom            'she'
                                          (archaic)
      .
However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the
rigid word order of SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT (SVO)as distinct from the Papuan SOV
word order (Wurm 1982:64). Other significant Austronesian features include: a
very simple derivational morphology; with very little inflectional affixation; the

common use of particles where verb affixation would be used in Papuan
languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions; no special sentence
                                                               Abun Introduction 9


      The influence of the Biak language

There are two language groups that have migrated to the region where Abun is
spoken, the As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated

from Gag island off Halmahera before the turn of the century, came to live in the
subdistrict of Mega where the Abun Ji dialed is spoken on the border of the
language area. This group is numerically very small and does not appear to
have had any significant influence on the Abun language. On the other hand

the Biak people, who Red from the island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area
in the early 1900s and have had a significant influence on the language of the
Abun people. Biak is an Austronesian language and is completely unrelated to
Abun. The Biak people brought the Christian religion to the Abun people and in
doing so used many of their own phrases and words. Words such as rur 'spirit'.
nadi 'pray' and som 'worship' were introduced from the Biak language. The

word for 'God', Yefun has come from the Biak fun 'respected person' combined
with the Abun prefix ye- 'person'. The Biak people being islanders had a far

greater number of terms for fish and other things related to the sea than the
Abun people who are traditionally semi-nomadic hunters. Therefore all these
things have been borrowed from the Biak language. Examples are yen 'sand',
kasem 'shark' and karabat 'sea eel'.


However these influences are lexical only. There are some minor syntactic
influences from the Biak language. A bC prefix, most likely borrowed from the
Biak language, is attached to any verbs that have been introduced from other
languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with what could be named, the
foreign verb verbaliser (FW) prefix. Example (1) uses the Biak word win 'sail',
and example (2) uses the Indonesian word pindah 'to move one's location' .



(1)   Men bi-win mu               mo       ef
      1p FW-sail go               LOC      island
      'Let's sail to the island.'
(2) Men       bi-pindah mu         mo     Bamogwim
      3~      wv-move     go       LOC    Bamogwim
      'We shifted to Bamogwim'

Win 'sail' is a sea-faring term borrowed from the Biak language. However, what
is most odd and uncharacteristic about this feature is that in Abun no verb
prefixes exist at all. Some older speakers who are fluent in the Biak language
also use the interrogative particles keka 'possibility'. Those Abun speakers who
have lived all their lives in the mountainous hinterland and have only recently
come to the coast have no knowledge of these terms.

     The influence of neighbouring languages

The Abun speaking people have had trade contact with the neighbouring tribal
groups who speak related languages. Trade with neighbouring language groups
in kain timur '(antique) eastern cloth' has been the main historical reason for
contact (apart from war and slave raids).       Kain t i w is one of the Abun
speaking people's main tokens of wealth. It originates from East Timur and
other neighbouring Indonesian islands. Kain timur is measured according to its
length and this is no doubt the reason for the decimal numbering system that all
the tribes that trade in kain timur have.      Nearby languages of the Papuan
phylum, such as Arandai, do not have this decimal system.


The influence of these neighbouring related languages sometimes accounts for
the surprising divergence of basic vocabulary, including personal pronouns, that
is found among the Abun dialects. For example, first person singular in the
most northern dialect is tat.    In the southern area this form appears as ji.
However Mai Brat first person singular is ta or tio. The final question marker
(i.e. interrogative particle) can either be ne or o.    Again in Mai Brat the
interrogative particle is o.

         Lexical Similarities with neighbouring WPP Languages

    One of the distinguishing features of the West Papuan Phylum is the distinct
    lack of lexical similarity amongst all member languages.            Lexicostatistical
    correlates are all extremely low and excepting for the Tehit and Moraid
    languages are all below twenty per a n t . The closest language lexically to the
    Abun language is Mai Brat (and in particular, the Karon Dori dialect), which is
    also part of the Central Bird's Head Stock, but is in a different family, the Central
    Bird's Head Familv. This lexical relations hi^ is rather low. somewhere in the

    order of 10-15% are cognate depending upon the dialects compared. (Berry 8
    Berry 1987:30 show figures of 6- 8% cognate for a dialect of Mai Brat and each
    of the three main Abun dialects. This is based on a word list of 200 words.)
    When the Swadesh 100 list is used the percentages tend to be about 5% higher
    as illustrated in Beny 8 Berry (198736).        These word lists do not contain
    commonly used cultural items of the people of this area. For example the word
    gwi bitch' is cornmor; to both Mai Brat and Abun. The word bafnik 'evil being'
    has been borrowed from Mpur to Abun. The type of kain timur cloth known as
    tuba is understood by all languages in the region that trade in this type of cloth.

P   Therefore in reality the lexical relationship is probably closer than surveys




    The other West Papuan Phylum languages show a lexical similarity of between
    3 and 6% (Berry & Berry 1987:30), or about 8- 11% based on the 100 word

    Swadesh list. According to the critical percentages used for classification of
    languages based on lexicostatistical comparison in Voorhoeve (1975: 16), these
    other languages are part of a different stock to Abun. A figure of 12O/0 - 27% of
    shared cognates would result in the classification of the languages as belonging
    to the same stock, but different families. So on the basis of the Swadesh 100

    word list Abun and Mai Brat were recorded as belonging to one stock, with a
    lexical similarity of approximately 11%, but they are belong to different families.
                                                               Abun Introduction 12



The other languages in the West Papuan Phylum of the Bird's Head belong to
other stocks.

     Influence of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia

Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so,

Bahasa Malayu has been used as a trading language in this area for several
centuries. To this day the particular dialect of lndonesian spoken in this area is
closer to Bahasa Malayu than standard lndonesian. Since the incorporation of
lrian Jaya into lndonesia a larger number of speakers are becoming bilingual in
Abun and Indonesian. However, for many Abun is the only language that they
know.


Many new terms have come to the Abun speaking people in Indonesian, for
example sabun 'soap', besi 'iron' and bangko 'seat'. Many lndonesian words
also accompanied the introduction of Christianity and have become part of the
Abun vocabulary. lndonesian words such as ampuni 'forgive', and berkat 'bless'
have been introduced although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning
of these lndonesian terms.


The influence of lndonesian upon Abun grammar is becoming more significant
as a force of language change than the mere incorporation of new lexical items.
This is most obvious in the village of Sausapor, a government administrative
centre. This is most readily seen in the area of complex sentences, the field of
discussion of this thesis. The Abun language has a wealth of conjunctions,
more than Indonesian. However, in Sausapor, the area where Abun Ji is
spoken, many of these are being replaced by lndonesian terms. The most
common of these are tap; from lndonesian tetapi 'but' and baru literally 'new',
which is used to mean 'next' or 'and then'. A more serious change involves that
of word order. In lndonesian the conjunction is placed before both sentences
i                                                                   Abun Introduction 13



    that are to be joined. In Abun this is not the case. The conjunction is placed
    between the sentences that are to be joined. Some speakers may remove the

    Abun conjunction altogether and replace it with an lndonesian one at the
    beginning of the sentence. The more common practice is to use both the Abun
    form and the lndonesian form within the one sentence. This can be seen with
    such conjunctions as kalau 'if (Abun does not have a single conjunction that
    means 'if), sebelum 'before' (Abun uses 'not yet') and asal 'as long aslcondition'.
    In examples (3) and (4) below the lndonesian form is underlined and the
    relevant Abun form is highlighted.



    (3)   Sebelum an yo            mu     n&    to      an   nai  an bi         yor.
          before       3s NEG go          not   still   3s   take 3s POSS       spear
          'Before he left he took his spear.'

    Some are also increasing their usage of the lndonesian negator bukan which
    only negates nouns. Again the Abun negator is retained resulting in forms such
    as:



    (4)   Bukan an       nde
          not     3s     NEG
          'Not him.'

    Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not always retain the original
    pronunciation. Abun does not have a velar nasal phoneme. The velar nasal
    occurs, but only preceding the velar voiced stop Igl.       So when words are
    borrowed such as bunga 'flower', another lgl is added and are pronounced as
    bungga. Or when they are word final such as the word kosong 'nil, empty, zero',

    they are pronounced as koson.

1.4 Phonology

The sound system of Abun is relatively simple and consists of 20 consonants
and 5 simple vowels. Also there are three tones, high, low and upgliding.'


The consonant phonemes of Abun are displayed in Table 3 below.

                                        TABLE3: CONSONANTS

                                        y=j,fi=p,ng=os


Prenasalised plosives are interpreted as units rather than sequences due to
syllabic structural pressure. There are no non-suspect CCC clusters word initial.
That means that mbre 'antique cloth' must be interpreted as mbre, a CCV
syllable.

  The phonological analysis of Abun has been undertaken by K. Berry and is described in the
thesis on Abun phonology and syntax by K. Berry (1995). The tables in this section are taken
from that paper.

1.5 Morphology

1.5.1 Typology

In relation to morphological typology Comrie (1989:46) discusses two indices,
namely the index of synthesis and the index of fusion as a means of comparing
languages. The index of synthesis compares the ratio of morphemes to words
in any given language and at one extreme are the languages of the isolating
type and at the other are languages of the polysynthetic type.          Using this
typology Abun would be described as an isolating language where the ratio of
morphemes to word is rather low. A sampling of the first 200 words in each of
five stories each by a five different speakers reveals an average morpheme to
word ratio of 1.13. This compares to English with a ratio of 1.68 or Eskimo
which has a ratio of 3.72 (Lyons 1968:188).             The virtual one to one
correspondence between words and morphemes in the Abun language can be
illustrated by the following sentence:



( 8 ) Men ben suk mo            nggwe yo,      men       ben    suk     sino.
      Ip  do thing LOC          garden then IP do               thing   together
     'If we do things at the garden, then we do it together.'

Comrie's second index, that of fusion, compares the extent to which morphemes
within the word are readily segmentable. Obviously there is little scope for
fusion in an isolating language and in fact the polymorphemic words are easily
segmentable, so there is no fusion. There is some slight variation of morpheme
shape which is predictable by the few phonological rules that are found in Abun.
                                                                          Abun Introduction 17



      Therefore, so far as it is applicable. Abun morphology could be described as
      agglutinating.


      All in all Abun has a basically monosyllabic word structure. A sampling of a

      typical story reveals that about 80% of the words are monosyllabic, about 15%
      have two syllables and only 5% have three or more.



       1.5.2 Affixation

      Affixation could not be said to be a feature of Abun morphology. Rather, a great
      variety of compounding exists in Abun. There are a limited number of forms
      which have been analysed as affixes for Abun. Of these, three are prefixes on
      nouns and four are suffixes on verbs. Table 5 summarises this information.

       1.5.2.1 Verb suffixes

       Of the four verb suffixes three are historically derived from free form
       prepositions and one from an adverb.          The suffix -wa originates from the
                                  as seen in example (9) below.
       preposition wa 'BENEFACTIVE~~O~',
I
    (9) Afl      fm           nu        yo       wa    men
         3s      prepare     house a             BEN   Ip
         'He prepared a house for us.'

    Because the object can be frequently omitted in Abun dause structure this
    leaves the verb adjacent to wa, providing the opportunity for coalescence.
    Therefore verb forms are created that have a benefactive meaning.           This

    extended 'benefactive' meaninn can be seen below.



    (10) Marinus        me h e m
         Marinus        see canoe
         'Marinus saw the canoe.'

    (1 1) Marinus       me-wa
         Marinus        take.care.of canoe
         'Marinus took care of the canoe.'

    However, there are certain verbs that no longer exist in Abun without the -wa
    suffix. The verbs syaretwa 'listen to' and rewa 'deny' no longer exist as syaret,
    and re. It appears that in the formation of these verbs there has been a certain
    amount of grammaticalisation occurring, with various free forms becoming
    affixes on these verbs (Hopper 1991:19ff).


    In Abun, a number of free forms now behave as affixes due to the principle of

    coalescence, whereby adjacent forms collapse together to function as a single
    unit. The decision to regard certain parts of compounds as affixes has been
    based on this principle of grammaticalisation.              In particular t h e

I   principle that Hopper terms 'divergence' seems to describe best the situation
    that occurs in Abun. He defines divergence as 'when a lexical form undergoes

    grammaticalisation to a clitic or affix, the original form may remain as an
    autonomous element.. .'(Hopper 1991:22) The type of change described here
    also occurred in Latin where various prefixes became inseparable from the root,
                                                                                      -




                                                                       Abun Introduction 19



'carry'. The decision to consider the forms listed in Table 5 as affixes rather
than parts of compounds has also been based on prosody and meaning change
of the resultant form, so much so that there is no longer synchronic identification
of the two formerly independent forms. All those forms here considered as
affixes behave like derivational affixes in that they function either to change
class or result in a meaning change which is in many cases unpredictable5.
However, all these words could be alternatively analysed as compound forms.
Given that compounding is more commonly found in Abun morphology than
affixation, such an analysis is equally viable?


The suffix -wa has another usage to that described above. It can also be used
to change non-transitive words such as intransitive stative verbs or nouns into
transitive verbs. It could be on the basis that the 'benefactive' verbs described
above are all inherently transitive that the -wa suffix has come to be used in a
way that is no longer related to the meaning of the preposition wa. Hopper
describes this process as 'specialisation' (Hopper 1991:25). Wa as a class-
changing transitive suffix will be described further in 1.6.1, but one example is




(12) lsak     syim-wa      nu-syo
     lsak     hand-TRANShouse-mouth
     'Isak shut the door.'

A second verb suffix -bot is derived from the free form preposition subot/bot
meaning ' P â‚¬ R L A T I V E / ~ ~ O(with
                                     ~ ~ subof
                                         / ~ ~ Obeing
                                                 U ~ ' the more common variant).




5~ more detailed argument as to why these compound forms have undergone historical change
to affixation is found in the paper by K. Berry (1995).
1' 1 appears that this dilemma is common, to quote Anderson (1985:45) "The line between
compounding and stem modification is not always easy to draw..., but this is not a matter of
major importance since the division is primarily a matter of convenience."
                                                                   Abun Introduction 20


(13) An     ki    subot suk mwa
     3s     talk about thing many
     'He talked about many things.'

While on some occasions the addition of -bot to a verb root will result in an
unpredictable meaning change, more frequently the addition of -bot results in a
meaning change that could best be described as adverbial. By the addition of
this suffix the meaning of the root has been changed to indicate that the action
was more thorough, more involved or more drawn out. Example (14) illustrates
this.



(14) Suk-sin      yenggras ki-bot           or       it
     NOM-wrong elders         talk-extend finish     COMP
     'These problems, the elders have finished discussing about (them).'

The third verb suffix -ket as a free form is the preposition ket, which may
function as a locative meaning 'across'. !? has another usage whereby with a
non-locative argument it has the meaning 'against' or perhaps 'to direct emotion
against someone'. This usage is shown in example (16) below.


                              ..
(15) A n      maskwa        11
     3s       angry          Is
     'He is angry with me.'


(16) A n     maskwa        ket          ji
     3s      angry         against       Is
     'He directed his anger against me.' or 'He was strongly opposed to me.'

This suffix is only used with a small number of stative verbs and the resultant
meaning change is completely unpredictable. Example (37) shows the verb
ye-ket 'to be surprised' from the verb root ye 'to be difficult'
                                                                 Abun Introduction 21


(17) An      ye-ket             Set mo sugato              an   ki     ne
     3s      difficult-against  Set at        thing-REL    3s    say DET
     'He was surprised with Set at that which he said (or because of what he
     said).'

A fourth verb suffix -gat can occur as a verb gat 'to spear' or as an adverb gat
'with intensity'.



(18) An        sok pa                  yewon       ne    i-be           gat
      3s       enter young.men shaman              DET   their-new      intensely
      'He is really putting in (a lot 09 new young men (to train) as shamans.'

As with prepositions adverbs may also occur adjacent to a verb which allows the
two forms to coalesce. As a suffix gat carries over this adverbial meaning of
intensity producing meaning changes on the root with something of this
adverbial element included.



(19) An      ki-gat        ji   syo mbre            is     an
     3s      talk-intensely I s give eastern.cloth 10      3s
     'He persuadedlforced me to give some eastern cloth to him.'

The suffixes described above are derivational in nature, so they do not modify
all verbs, but rather just a relatively small number.      The meaning changes
involved are by no means consistent and in some cases unpredictable.



1.5.2.2 Noun prefixes

In Abun verbs are modified by means of a suffix. Nouns on the other hand, are
modified by a prefix. In the analysis below three forms are described as noun
prefixes. The choice of the term 'prefix' is preferred here because all three
prefixes involved convey grammatical rather than               lexical information.
Compounds may have meanings that are lexically idiosyncratic.                Affixes
frequently involve meaning changes that are syntactic in nature.
    The noun prefix -suk is a class-changing affix. The word suk            IS   the general

    concrete noun 'thing'. Verbs and adjectives can be changed into nouns in Abun
    by the prefixation of suk- 'nominaliser'. Examples (20) and (21) below illustrate
1   its use.




    (22) An       ye-nau
         3s       PERS-palm. wine
                                                                                                 t
         'He is a drunkard.'                                                                     I




                                                                                                 i
    (23) Men     ndo-wa    men bi   ye-syirn we,                  ye-Korea        yo si          1
         lp      ask-about l p POSS PERS-arm two                  ~ E R S - ~ o r e a with

         ye-Amerika          YO
                                                                                                 ;
         PERS-America        a                                                                   i
         'We asked about our two friends, a Korean and an American.'                             1
                                                                                                 I

    These      prefixes   like    verb   suffixes   appear   to    have    undergone         a
    grammaticalisation process in that they have coalesced with the noun they have
                                                                     Abun Introduction 23



preceded. In the process they have acquired grammatical status, whereas as
free forms they retain their lexical meaning.


The third noun prefix is slightly different to the two described above. This final

noun prefix does not occur as a free form in Abun. Abun distinguishes between
alienable and inalienable possession. Inalienable possession is used for body
parts and certain other possessive relationships which could best be described
as 'whole-part', The whole-part relationship is only applicable for living entities,
such as plants, animals and people. The whole is the possessor and the part is
the thing possessed.       For example 'leaf is always kwe-nat 'tree-leaf and
'feathers' are always ndam-go 'bird-hair'.        Within these compound forms the
second morpheme is always bound. The first morpheme is not bound and may
be omitted. If this morpheme, that is the possessor or the 'whole', is omitted, it
must be replaced by the proform I-. The translation of this proforrn is equivalent
to the English possessive 'its'. This produces examples like (24) and (25).



(24) A         go     ndam-som       yo,             a        gwjm i-da           ne
     2s        cut.up bird-bat       when.lRR        2s       peel its-skin       DET


     we               kadit
     to.one.side      from
     'When you prepare a bat, you peel its skin right off...'


(25) a        tik      I-onyar        we              kadit
     2s       pull its-intestines to.one.side from
     '..you pull its intestines right out from it...'


1.5.2.3 Clitic -i

Besides the affixes mentioned above, there is also a clitic which occurs in the
Abun language. This clitic, -I, only occurs in compound structures, never in a

simple clause. The clitic adds the meaning that the events that are expressed
                                                              Abun Introduction 24



within the compound sentence occurred simultaneously. The clitic must be
bound to both clauses of the compound sentence in order to convey the
meaning of simultaneity. It is the final element in these clauses but since it is
phonologically bound it always takes secondary stress in the word that it forms a
part of. This clitic will be described further in Chapter 4 under Subordinate
Conjunctions, but an example is given below.



(26) Men do             mo Syumr      men ne       titi        ma-i
     Ip  some.of        at Syurur     Ip  DET      run.away    go-SIM

     a       mo       Fef     a    mu-i
     2~      at       Fef     2p   go-SIM
     'Those of us from Syurur we quickly came here, while you from Fef, you
     went too.'


1.5.3 Compounds

A wide variety of compounds exist in the Abun language. Evidence that a form

is a compound rather than a phrase comes from the rules of stress placement.
In Abun, if a word does consist of more than one syllable, stress is always
syllable final. Compounding is a strategy frequently used to describe new or
introduced items. Also compounding is used to create to various demonstrative
                                                                                     I
and locative words.
                                                                                     ti
     Noun Compounds                                                                  3
                                                                                     I

                                                                                     !

Some compounds have been created to describe items foreign to the culture.           4
For example kwem-ok 'canoe-fly: aeroplane' and silk-mise 'thingevil: gun'.
                                                                                     1
                                                                                     rj
                                                                                     L
                                                                                     r

These compounds have the structure noun + verb. Other noun compounds                 ,.
                                                                                     u




describe already known items and have the structure noun + noun.             For
example nu-syo 'house-mouth: doorldooway', iok-wak 'stone-hole: cave', and
gwem-bo 'face-fruit: nose.'
                                                                             Abun lntroductian 25


      Locative and demonstrative compounds

The three deictic particles re 'this/hereqne 'thatlthere' and tu 'over there' can be
used to create a variety of compounds, some locative, some not. Another
particle to, a subordinating particle7, can be used to create a small group of

compounds.

1.6 Syntax

1.6.0 Ovewiew of Abun syntax

Abun has been described above as an isolating language which makes little use
of affixation in its grammatical system.              Therefore the functions that are
frequently ascribed to affixation in synthetic languages must in Abun grammar

be indicated by other means and strategies. Affixation is frequently a means
whereby other languages indicate such things as tense, aspect and mood. Also
affixation is often present to signify grammatical relations such as Subject,
Object, Indirect Object etc. However, as described above, all affixation in Abun

is derivntiorial in nature and is mainly concerned with class changes. These
affixes relate on the whole to phrase level syntax and do not affect the internal
structure of the clause.




h his particle is described fully in Chapter 2,Relative Clauses.
                                                                       Abun Introduction 26



    Therefore when it comes to grammatical relations or the variations of tense,
    aspect and mood to be found in Abun there are two key strategies which
    express these concepts:

                 1. Word Order

    and          2. Particles



    The dual means of fixed word order and the use of particles will account for all
    types of syntactic variation which in synthetic languages would be camed largely
    by affixation.



    1.6.1 Core grammar and grammatical relations

    The Abun language, like all languages of the West Papuan Phylum has SUBJECT
    VERB OBJECT      word order. This word order is inflexible, insofar as the position of
    an entity in relation to the verb will encode what its grammatical relation is. The
    grammatical relations of subject and object are encoded by word order alone,
    with the subject always that constituent which immediately precedes the verb,
    and if there is an object it will immediately follow the verb.


    Because of the lack of inflectional affixation it is not possible through this means
    to ascertain whether Abun is either a nominative-accusative language or an

    ergative-absolutive language.       There are no affixed forms to indicate case
    marking on nouns.         There are no different pronominal forms which could
    indicate the different cases of nominative, accusative and genitive.              The
    pronouns of Table 2 are invariant in form whether they refer to Subject, Object
    or Possessor. It is word order alone that gives the key to these grammatical
    relations. On this grounds, both S, subject of the intransitive clause and A,
I

1   subject of the transitive clause are treated alike. So Abun is a nominative-
                                                                           Abun Introduction 27



accusative language. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0, object immediately
follows the verb.


Other grammatical relations including that of Indirect Object are indicated by free
form prepositions. Again word order is crucial. The indirect object, which in
Abun is a prepositional phrase, always follows the direct object. A recipient, for
example, could not immediately follow the verb. This could not happen unless
the direct object was omitted and the recipient retained.                    In fact the only

constituents of the Abun clause which are free to move are those which are
adverbial in nature. Free form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time
or iocation are free from the otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause.
Abun word order is shown as follows:

(ADJUNCT)+ SUBJECT + VERB + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT)                 + (ADJUNCT)


The adjunct in an Abun clause. (meaning various prepositional phrases
expressing locative, instrument, benefactive etc) is normally the final element
following the object and indirect object if they are present.                   If the adjunct
expresses location it may be fronted to precede the subject. This is usually
done to change the focus and often changes the semantic scope of the
predi~ate.~
         A time adjunct will normally precede the subject.



1.6.2 Grammatical relations hierarchy and Abun

It has been proposed that the grammatical relations of subject, object. indirect

object and obliques can be considered to form a hierarchy. This notion of
8
 In modern syntactic theory the constituent that is smaller than a sentence IS the phrase
However in the tagmemic theory devised by KCPike (see for example Longacre 1983 p269ff)
the constituent smaller than the sentence is the clause. If this theory of constituent division 1s
followed then Abun word order is rigid in every aspect. If in Abun a time or location adjunct 1s
fronted then it is no longer inside the clause but it is part of a sentence. This difference, hen
the adjunct is no longer part of a predicate is most clearly seen in negative indicative
sentences These differences are more fully discussed in K. Berry (1995).

the higher end of the hierarchyg. Abun conforms to this hierarchy, in that the
core or nuclear grammatical relations (subject and object) are unmarked. It is
not until reaching the lower levels of the hierarchy, that is the indirect object and
oblique relations that case marking is evident, which for Abun is by means of
free form prepositions. Abun has no person-number agreement marked on its
verbs. This is an unusual areal feature in that every other language of the West
Papuan Phylum marks person-number subject agreement on the verb. This
information has been summarised in Table 7 outlining grammatical changes
which occur along the grammatical relations hierarchy for Abun. In Abun, as in
English, the hierarchy is also evident in the basic word order:
SUBJECT - OBJECT- INDIRECT OBJECT - OBLIQUES/ADJUNCTS.

    The examples below illustrate the different Abun clause types.

    1. Intransitive:

    (27) An     ku
         3s     cough
         'He coughs.'


    (28) Ji      nYu
         Is      fear (stative verb)
          'I am afraid.'


    Intransitive clauses consist minimally of a Subject and Verb in that order.

    2. Transitive:

    (29) An      git     boge
         3s      eat     fish
         'He eats fish.'


    (30) Nu       nyu-wa       men o         nde
         2~       fear-TRANS 1p       again NEG
         'Don't fear us any more' or 'Don't you be afraid of us any more.'

    Transitive clauses consist minimally of a Subject, Verb and Object in that order.
    Example (30), a transitive clause, also differs from example (281, an intransitive
    clause, in that in (30) the stative verb nyu 'fear' takes an object. With verbs
    such as nyu, which may occur as intransitive, the presence of the object is
    always indicated, by the suffix -wa. In the same way the presence of an implied
    object is also indicated by -wa. It is a common practice in Abun conversation to
    omit objects and also various types of adjuncts if these have been previously
I
I

    mentioned in the immediate ccntext. Example (31) below shows the use of -wa
    with an implied object.



    (31) Ji      i-wa
         IS      happy-TRANS
         'I am happy about thatlto do that.'
                                                                Abun Introduction 30



Therefore a clause of the structure SUBJECT + VERB + -WA is also transitive
because the addition of -wa indicates an implied object.


3. Ditransitive:


(32) Ji       syo sugum           is      an
     Is       gave money          10      3s
     'I gave (the) money to her.'

In example (32) the shift down the grammatical relations hierarchy is clearly
shown with the introduction of prepositions to mark the relation of indirect object.
The indirect object preposition varies according to dialect. This preposition can
either be is (Abwn Ji) or nai (Abun Ye and Abun Tat) and many speakers use
either.


4. Clause with Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrase):


Various types of prepositional phrase may be added to the basic clause. As
seen above, the ditransitive clause is of this structure, namely a prepositional
phrase added to a transitive clause.           There are several other types of
prepositional phrase which are illustrated below.



(33) An     mu      mo nu
     3s     go      LOC   house
     'He went to the house.'


(34) An     ma      kagit Filipus        bi         nu
     3s     come from        Filipus     POSS       house
     'He came from Filipus' house.'


(35) Pa           sap wo         kwai su      mban
     youngman     cut     fish kwai with axe
     'The young man cut the eel with an axe.'
                                                                     Abun Introduction 31


(36) An     git ji bi    kasem i   gat0 ji                  kon wa         ji
     3s     eat I s POSS shark own REL 1s                   cook for        1s

     bi        nu    ne
     POSS      house DET
     'She ate my (own, emphasis) shark that I cooked for my family (lit. house).'

A full list of Abun prepositions is given below:

indirect object      islnai             'to'
locative             mo                 'atlto'
                     subot              'againstlalong'
                     kagit              'from'
                     karowa             'near'
                     ket                'acrossfagainst'
instrument           su                 'with'
accompaniment        si                 'with'
benefactive          wa                 'for'

There is a larger form of the locative phrase which is used with the preposition
mo. Mo can be understood to mean general location and when a more specific
location is intended another locative word follows the noun. These locative
nouns which follow the head of the locative phrase could be described as
'relator nouns'lo

For example:

               mo      nu        mit          'inside the house'
               mo      nu        git          'in fmnt of the house'
               mo      kwe       ke           'at the base of the tree'
               mo      kwe       ndet         'in between the trees'
               mo      kwe       nim          'above the tree' etc

5. Verbless clauses:


In Abun there are a small number of verbless clauses. These verbless clauses

are equational in nature and they consist merely of two noun phrases, without

    any linker or copula between them. One type shown in example (37) equates
    two noun phrases. Another type, illustrated by example (38),consists of a noun

    phrase as subject and a locative prepositional phrase as predicate.

    (38) An       mo      nu
         3s       LOC     house
         'He (is) at (the) house.'


    1.6.3 Abun particles
I


    The effect of word order in Abun syntax to indicam grammatical relations has
    already k e n described. The second major strategy that Abun uses, that of
I
    particles, is used to convey the concepts of mood and aspect.               The term
I
I

    'particle' is used to mean a free form word that is a member of a closed class. It
I
    is an invariant form that never occurs in an environment where it could be
    described as 'bound'.


    Because the use of word order is significant in Abun, mood or aspect particles
    must also follow the rules of word order. If a clause includes a mood or aspect
I
    particle, that particle will always be in clause final position. An Abun clause then
I   has the followina structure:


    (ADJUNCT)   +   SUBJECT   +   VERB   +   (OBJECT)   + (INDIRECT OBJECT)+ (ADJUNCT)
                                                                                     +

    (ASPECT)   + (MOOD)



    Given this structure for an Abun clause, it can be seen that the mood or aspect

    particles are not bound as affixes.. The particles may occur after either the
    verb, the object, the indirect object or an adjunct depending on the length of the
                                                                    Abun Introduction 33



    particular clause concerned. Also these particles are not clitics in that the
    particle takes equivalent phonological stress along with every other word in the

    clause.


    No reference has yet been made to tense. In Abun, concepts concerned with
    tense are carried by time words or phrases and sequential conjunctions. In the

    case of complex sentences there are two subordinate conjunctions which
    convey tense concepts. These two conjunctions are described as being 'realistI
    where a preceding clause refers to events already past, or 'irrealis', where a
    preceding clause refers to events that have not actually occurred, being either in
    future time or hypothetical. These subordinate conjunctions will be discussed at
    greater length in Chapter 4.



    1.6.3.1 Mood particles

    In Abun the constituent termed 'mood' is unmarked for the indicative and
    marked for other types. It is indicated by means of a clause final particle. One
    interesting feature of the mood particles is that in two instances, that of
    interrogative and indicative negative       particles are used to indicate these
    moods. In Abun, the strategy of using        particles (as opposed to one) is for
    the purpose of delineating constituent boundaries.         Thus the constituent
    "interrogative" is marked by two particles, one termed the initial question marker.
    IQM,   occurring clause initially and the other, the final question marker, FQM,
    which ends or closes the interrogative. In modern usage the initial question
    marker appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language
    Indonesian. which does not possess such a particle.


    The indicative negative also makes use of two particles. These particles jointly

    outline the constituent "predicate". One of these particles is a member of the
I
II
I
         small group of particles described as predicate markers. The meanings of the
I
I
         predicate markers range across the entire spectrum of concepts that are
I
         normally referred to as tense, aspect or mood."                  The other particle, which
         occurs after the predicate is considered the primary negative particle, because
         used on its own it may answer a question in the negative.

         The various mood particles are listed in table 8, followed by examples of the
         various mood types.12

     3s     make rotan-mouth for         wild. pig      FRUST
     'He made a trap for wild pigs but he did not trap any'
or    'He made a trap for wild pigs but to no avail.'


(52) An      pet     ndam ware, kunus yo          kom nde
     3s      shoot bird FRUST arrow NEG reach NEG
     'He shot a bird in vain, his arrow did not reach (it).'
or   'He tried to shoot a bird, but his arrow missed (it).'


The meaning of ware is inherently negative and so it has been interpreted as
another mood in Abun. The nearest English equivalent would be 'in vain', 'to no
avail' or 'but without success.' Its meaning is that an action was attempted but
the goal of tirs action was not achieved.


Negative Interrogatives:

                                                                                           i
When there is an interaction of two moods, which is only the case with negative
interrogatives, then the negative always occurs prior to the final interrogative
                                                                                           I


particle.
                                                                                           :
                                                                                           4


(53) Ben      sa      u      anato nan yo       ma    more nde        ne?
     do       like which Foc 2s            NEG come here NEG          FQM
     'How is it that (or why) you did not come here?'

                                                                                           5

This interaction reveals that the word order of the primary negative particle nde
is very important in Abun. For if there is also an aspect particle within the          .   !
                                                                                           ,
clause, the negative must precede it. This is not the case for any other mood.
                                                                                           !
This means that for these types of clause Abun word order is as follows


SUBJECT + yo   + VERB + nde + (ASPECT) + (INTERROGATIVE)
                                                                Abun Introduction 38


1.6.3.2 Aspect and modality particles

The various aspect particles that are found in Abun are not obligatory. There

are a limited number, listed as follows:


      ASPECT        TYPE           GLOSS         MEANING

                     perfective    PERF          'already'
                     completive    COMPL         'completed'
                     incompletive INCOMPL        'yet, still'


The perfective aspect, re, has the meaning that an event has already taken
place. It is used to confirm the actuality of the event and implies a continuing
relevance of it. The completive aspect, it, emphasises the finality or completed
state of a particular event or action. In contrast, the incompletive aspect, to, is

x e d to indicate that a particular event or action is not yet completed and the on-
going nature of that particular action. All of these aspect particles in Abun [nay
be used irrespective of the particular time frame of the state or event. That is to
say whether the event occurs in past, present or future time does not change
the meaning of the aspect or limit its use. Normally there is only one aspect
particle in any clause. The following examples illustrate the usage of Abun
aspect particles.



             ne      kwopre
     child that die         PERF
     'That child had died.'


(55) An     jam      baca ndo it
             know read good COMPL
     'She had finally knew how to read well.'
or   'She has completed learning how to read properly.'

(59) Prisila ma      sap Barbarina      o      Ya
     Prisila come cut      Barbarina    again POSSIB
     'Prisila might come and cut Barbarina again.'


(60) Ji       mu     it        are       go!
     Is'      go     COMPL now           intent
     'Hey, I'm definitely going now! (italics intended for emphasis)




                                                                                       I
(61) Kadit    nau           re   sangge          anato         ben     to
     From     palm.wine     PERF true            reason        do      causative
                                                                                       3


     men      yo     kem    ndo nde       re   bayok                                   \
                                                                                       4
              NEG    live   good NEG      PERF probably                                :

     'Because of (my drinking) palm wine, it is true, that is probably the reason
     that caused us not to live happily (together).'

In example (60) a modality particle occurs after an aspect particle, and example       ,
(61) is an instance of both aspect and modality particles following the negative.
Therefore the order of these particles is as follows:

                            NEGATIVE+ASPECT+MODALIN



1.6.4 Phrase structure

BeFore finishing this brief study of Abun syntax a few words need to be said
about phrase structure. This area of Abun grammar is consistent with what has

already been stated about the syntax of the Abun language in that word order
plays a crucial role and particles, rather than affixation, are used to represent
significant constituents.


A bnef look at two areas, noun phrases and possessive phrases, will show that

free form particles make up a significant part of Abun phrase structure.
                                                                Abun Introduction 42   1
                                                                                       I
(64) warn do-ketke
     time       count-beginning
     'the first time'


(65) nggwe jamsem         SYe
     garden cassava       big
     'big cassava garden'


(66) mbre            toba sak g~
     eastern.cloth toba CLASS three
     'three lengths of "toba" cloth'                                                   I
(67) suk-du            wokgan      dik    yo
     ~ O ~ - s p e a k little      one    DET.INDEF
     'a little story'

If it is desired to modify a noun phrase with more than two modifiers of the same
class, for instance by two adjectives, then the preference is to juxtapose this
next to the noun phrase in some way. This could be by means of a verbless

clause or it may be by means of a relative clause. For example:


(68) Ji       bi      pa    do-nggon         we,    pa    ne    wok td
     Is       POSS child count-female two           child DET   small INCOMPL
     'I have two girls. The girls are still small.'


1.6.4.2 Determiners

There are several determiners in Abun. There are three deictics (described
earlier in 1.5.3) &, ne and tu. There is also another type of determiner which
expresses an unknown/unspecific, knownlspecific distinction. The determiner
yo has the meaning 'a, some' and could be considered indefinite.                The

determiner ne may not always mean 'that' but may be translated as 'the, specific'
and so contrasts with yo.


Several particles also occur within the noun phrase and like the determiners.

when present, they are in the phrase final position. These are ga 'anaphoric




                -    -
                                                                     Abun    oduction


                                                                                             1

    referent, previously mentioned noun', ana 'means of focus' and to
    'demonstrative/external referent'.   When these particles compound with the
                                                                                             I

    determiners &, ne and tu they likewise retain phrase final position.



    1.6.4.3 Possessive phrases
                                                                                            \




    Abun distinguishes between alienable and inalienable possession. lnalienable             I



    possession is used when referring to parts of the body, 'whole-part' relationships      i

    (described earlier in 1.6.2.2, such as 'tree-leaf, 'bird-feathers', etc) but not when   iI



    referring to kinship terms. Inalienable possession is unmarked. The word order          i
                                                                                             i

                                                                                             I:
    of the phrase is: POSSESSOR + POSSESSED. No form of marking whatever marks               :



I
I
    either possessor or possessed. When the possessor is indicated by a pronoun
    no distinctive possessive pronouns are used.         Juxtaposition is sufdicient to
                                                                                            i

                                                                                             2

         'My arm is broken.'                                                                i
                                                                                            ':
                                                                                            g
    Alienable possession is used to dascribe all other possessive relationships. In         15.t
    these cases Abun uses the possessive word bi. It is not possible to say that bi         ..
    marks either the possessor or the possessed in the possessive phrase. Bi joins
    the two as a linker (Croft 1990: 28-32). Thus the alienable possessive phrase
                                                                                            I
                                                                                            !

                                                                                            i
                                                                                            4

                                                                                            P

        This analysis indicates that the possessive phrase is neither head nor
        dependent marked. This is a probable outcome of the fact that Abun does not
        use affixation to convey syntactic information but rather relies on word order and
1
I
I       particles for these purposes.



        (71) Andar bi      im             ma
             Andar POSS mother            come
             'Andar's mother came.'


        (72) Ji      si     Marta anato kern mewa men bi              suk
             1s      with Marta FOC stay guard I p             POSS things
             'Marta and I are the ones who will stay (behind) and look after our things.'

        The alienable possessive phrase may bs contracted, in that either possessor or
        possessed may be omitted from the possessive phrase provided the immediate
        context gives sufficient information. For example



        (73) Sadrakbi      im            re     ben bi        suk ot        ye
             Sadrak POSS mother          DEM do        poss things sharp very
             'Sadrak's mother does things rather callouslyl has a short temper.'

        In example (73) above the possessor preceding bi suk has been omitted.
        Likewise a noun that is possessed may be omitted also, shown in the following
        example.



        (74) Markus it       mo kwem wokgan gat0 Martinus                    bi     ne
             Markus climb LOC canoe littie             REL    Martinus       POSS DET
             'Markus got into the small canoe that belonged to Martinus.'

        Just as the alienable possessive phrase can be contracted it can also be
I
        expanded. To emphasise or clarify ownership of a particular item the particle i
        can be added to the phrase. This particle has similar meaning to the English
I1      word 'own'
(75) Ji     bi    nu   i
     Is     POSS house own
     'my own house'


(76) Ji      bi    suk i          anane
     Is      POSS things own FOCUS
     'Those are my things there!' (italics added to indicate emphasis)

When the possessed noun is omitted from these types of phrases the resultant
meaning is similar to the English pronouns 'mine, his etc'.



(77) Te      lsak nai    sugum         bi-wa           ji     bi   i
     then    Isak take money           pay-for          Is    POSS own
     'Then lsak took money to pay for mine'.

There are yet other types of noun phrases in Abun; however, the above
description gives typical patterns within the limited scope of this introductory
chapter. The purpose of this brief overview of Abun syntax has been to lay a
sufficient foundation for the following chapters. The characteristics of Abun
subordinate clauses and co-ordinate sentences are consistent with the overall
principles described here.

    to a previously mentioned noun phrase which usually represents a group of                 I
    undefined size. When either kwa or do are used they refer to part of the                  2:I

    previously mentioned whole. Kwa can only be used with non-tangible referents
    (that is, nouns that cannot be counted or considered specific items). For this
    reason it is best translated as 'part of ' or 'some of. Do can only be used with
    specific or tangible referents.

    2.3 The relative conjunction gat0

    The relative conjunction gato is made up of two morphemes: ga 'anaphoric
    referenvthe former' and to 'noun modifying particle (NMP)'.           Gato may be

    translated as 'that', 'which', 'who' etc. In quick speech it is abbreviated to ga,
    indicating that the particle to which carries a grammatical meaning rather than a
    lexical one is not always considered necessary. Gato is not a relative clause
    pronoun since neither ga or to can be used on their own to replace nouns, as
    will be further discussed below.      However, gat0 cannot be described as a
    general subordinating conjunction (as is the case with English 'that'). Gato is
    exclusively used to mark constructions of the restrictive relative clause type. A
    study of its two component morphemes shows how it fulfils this role.



    2.3.1 Anaphoric referent ga

    The particle ga 'anaphoric referent' was briefly introduced in Chapter 1 as a type
    of determiner (see 1.6.4.2 and also 1.5.3). As such it can never be used on its

    own as a pronoun to replace some previously mentioned noun. Ga always

    modifies a noun and is always part of a noun phrase. It assists in referring back
    to a previously mentioned noun. In discourse it serves to distinguish secondary

    participants from the main participantlspeaker. The noun which ga modifies will
                                                                 Abun relative clauses 50



I
    have been introduced earlier as a secondary participant. When this participant
    is mentioned again ga is added as if to remind the hearers. In the examples

    below several sentences of the discourse have been included to show how this
    particle is used.



    (12) Ji    ki  do   A me-wa       ber-gan Prisila ku       Barbarina re
         1s    say COMP 2s look-TRANS later-IittlePrisila meet Barbarina this

         Ji     do      rna       sa     Prisila       ga        wai     mo       ji
         Is     PRED    COme      when-R Prisila       ANAPH     g0.pa~f at        IS
         'I said "You look out (for yourself). In a little while Prisila will meet
         Barbarina." As I was coming along Prisila, that I had just mentioned, came
         past me.'


    (13) Sepenyel       mu     fro            bi   suk or        an        ma
         Sepenyel       go     prepare        poss things finish 3s        come

         ti             kenyak      ji        mo     ji     bi   nu.   Ji         si
         seaward        plan-to-meet Is       at      1s    POSS house Is         with



         'After Sepenyel went to prepare his things he went to meet me at my
         house. I went together with him (the last mentioned) to Garden River.'

    In the English translation of these sentences it seems awkward to include the
    literal meaning of ga 'the one that was last mentioned.' In Abun discourse,
    however, it is a necessary inclusion as a means of identifying participants.
    When ga is joined to the noun modifying particle to to make up the relative
    conjunction gato, ga serves to identify or mark the head of the relative clause as
    a specific referential identity. Although within the relative clause ga does not

    actually indicate that the head has been already mentioned, it does indicate that
    the head is specific in that it is either known to the hearers or present within the
    events being described. For a restrictive relative clause ga identifies the head
    that is to be modified. Instead of having the meaning 'the nounlparticipant that
                                                            Abun relative clauses 51



we were just talking about' as it would in a discourse, here it means 'this is the
noun that we are going to describe further.'



2.3.2 The function of the noun modifying particle to

The noun modifying particle to (from here onwards abbreviated to NMP) serves
to indicate that a noun has been modified in some way other than through
means of an adjective. In some cases this modification will be another noun
phrase added to give extra clarification to the speaker's meaning. For example,



(14) Wo     suk-fo      to        ndam    syor      f7e      yo,          nu-we
     but    thing-taboo NMP       bird    cassowary DET      w h e n . 1 ~2p-two
                                                                           ~

     git      nde
     eat      NEG
     'But a forbidden thing, that is that cassowary, you two cannot eat.'

In other cases the modification is a noun phrase embedded within a locative
phrase to clarify the location further.



(15) Men    gwa be;      yam0 banbo           to     Waibene    de     rut
     IP     beat sago at       mountain       NMP W a i b e ~ side
                                                                ~ ~ far
     'We beat the sago on the mountain, that is, on Waibe mountain on the far
     side.'

When a speaker wishes to give illustrations of his subject matter then sa 'like' is
added to to forming sat0 'for examplelsuch as'. The noun phrases that follow
sato are all embeddings of the noun phrase which to modifies.



(16) Regina ben      sin   su       pa    yesok sato           Am01 e
     Regina do       wrong with     child youth such.as        Arnol and

     Lambertus       e       sat0         Ye           Timor
     Lambertus       and     such.as      person       Timor
     'Regina committed adultery with (some) young men such as Arnol and
     Lambertus, and such as the Timorese man.'
    However since relative clauses are also modifications of a noun, to has the
    grammatical role of indicating that these clauses are embedded or subordinate.
i
I   Instead of describing to as a noun modifying particle, an alternative is to
!
    describe it as a general subordinating conjunction. If a conjunction can embed
    phrase within phrase as in examples (14) and (15) above then this is certainly
    the best description of to.



    2.3.3 Gato- a relative marker or a relative conjunction?

    Comrie's definition that a relative clause consists minimally of a head and a
    restricting clause, given earlier, does not seem to leave room for a relative
    conjunction as a unit in its own right within the relative clause. Under Comrie's

    definition it is necessary to place such items as relative pronouns or relative
    markers within the restricting clause.      For instance relative pronouns are
    considered clause initial. However, since gat0 is not a relative pronoun it cannot
    be considered as part of the restricting clause. In regard to the particle gal it is
    always a part of a noun phrase. For example, it is possible to say Yohana ga
    'Yohana who I just mentioned' or an ga 'he, the one I just mentioned' as
    described in 2.3.1 above. But this is not the case for the particle to. It is not
    possible to say Yohana to for this has no meaning. Because the grammatical
    function of to is to identify a subordinate structure of some kind, it cannot stand
    as part of a noun phrase, but rather it is the initial component of the subordinate
    structure.


    The two morphemes of gat0 thus enable it to behave as a conjunction or linker.
    The first morpheme ga could be said to be actually part of the noun phrase head
    of the relative clause. The second morpheme to is the iriitial component of the

    restricting clause. The combined form gat0 therefore behaves like a bridge or
                                                                           Abun relative clauses 53        ;




        linker between both head and restricting clause giving rise to the description
                                                                                                           i
        stated earlier in 2.1.                                                                            ii

        This structure is similar to English relative constructions when two elements
                                                                                                       i


        such as 'that which' in 'He knows that which he wants' merge to the single
        element 'what' in 'He knows what he wants.'                                                    L
                                                                                                       L




    L

                                                                                                       I

        There are also other reasons for considering gat0 a relative conjunction and not               !i
        simply some sort of relative particle. Although the particle ga serves to identify
        the head, there are subordinating conjunctions in Abun that are likewise part of
                                                                                                      I3

        may never be sentence final (or for that matter phrase or clause final)'.


        Thus the relative conjunction gato is an integral part of both head and clause
        and cannot be separated from either. The fact that the conjunction behaves
        additionally as a linker between the two parts is not unusual in Abun grammar.2
                                                                                                      II

        This is another reason for considering gat0 a conjunction and not a particle                  \
        because it shows consistent behaviour with the rest of the language.                          Ia

Besides consisting of a fuli clause, the restricting clause may consist of a single     i
                                                                                        t




word. This single word may be an adjective as in example (17)' or an adverb as

in (18).



(17) Kwa            ga     ndo yo,              men nai,

     but     thase.things REL     bad    when.lRR      3p       ignore
     'Those things that are good we take, but those things that are bad we
     ignore.'


(18) Ye-wis         Ye-nden              ye- wis     gat0 ketke
     people-type    people-interior      people-type REL beginning
     'The Bush people tribe was the tribe who (were from) the beginning.'

The clause may also consist of a single phrase such as a locative phrase,

example ( I 9),or an instrumental phrase, as in example (20).



(19) men     syesyar       men    bi   suk rnwa gat0 mo               nu
     IP      put.out       ~p     POSS things many REL at             house

     women eat thing-REL with oil             not
     'Women must not eat things that (are cooked) with oil.'

It is possible to have more than one relative clause modifying a head as in

example (21).
                                                            Abun relative clauses 55

2.5 Relative clause formation strategy

In any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a
grammatical relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main
clause and in the relative clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there
is more significant variation in encoding the grammatical relation of the
head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause (Comrie
1989:147, 153). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the

head within the relative clause.     These he terms non-reduction, pronoun
retention, relative pronoun and gap. Non-reduction means 'that the head noun
appears in full, unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal
position andlor with the normal case marking.' (Comrie 1989:147) With pronoun
retention the head noun is represented in the embedded clause as a pronoun.
When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the
relative clause is overtly indicated (Comrie 1989:151). The fourth strategy,
however, does not provide any overt indication of the role of the head within the
relative clause at all. The head is actually omitted from the relative clause. For
this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative clause structure
shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie's list, the gap strategy.


Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting
clause. The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head
noun, nor is there a relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head
                                                             Abun relative clauses 56



noun, nor is there a full noun phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is
omitted in the restricting clause thereby creating a gap. But since the restricting
clause does not contain any reference to the head noun, how can one know
what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?


As explained previously in Chapter 1, Abun does not actually mark the case of
nouns. The grammatical relations of Subject, Object etc, are normally marked
by word order .    Therefore it is the word order of the relative clause that
provides the clues for encoding the grammatical relation of the head. The
location of the gap created by the omission of the head gives the answer to this.
For example



(22) Me mu           gu     ye             gat0 man sin   su           men     bi
     IP go           kill   person         REL  do  wrong with         Ip      POSS

     nggon
     woman
     We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
     from our clan).'

In (22) above the restricting clause following gat0 contains no subject. There is
a gap between the relative conjunction gat0 and the verb phrase man sin 'do
wrong' indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject.
Therefore the grammatical relation of the head ye 'person' within the restricting
clause is subject. Compare this example with the relation of the relativised
argument in example (23):



(23) Ji       nut-bot             Ye              gat0 ji      i- wa       ne
     Is       thought-about        person         REL   1s     happy-TRANS DET
     'I thought about the person that I liked.'

Here there is a gap after the verb iwa 'like' even though the transitive S       -wa
                                                                             U ~ X

Indicates that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye
                                                                    Abun relative clauses 57



'person' is interpreted as having the grammatical relation of object in the relative

clause.'



2.5.1 The role of the determiner

It was said in 2.1 above that some restrictive relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns 16 'this' and ne 'that' have several
functions in Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike with
English determiners it is not obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in
Abun.


What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not
found in every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example (22) above has
no determiner in contrast to example (23) in which the restrictive relative clause
is closed by the determiner ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly,
in example (22) the relativised argument of the clause has the grammatical
relation of subject. In (23) the relativised argument has the grammatical relation
of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in each
restricting clause is different. In example (22) the gap is clause initial since the
subject in Abun is clause initial. In (23) the gap would have been clause final if
the determiner had not closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing
the clause, actually assists in locating the gap, and thereby assists in encoding
the grammatical relation of the head.


The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct
object is to be relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct
object is to be relativised, but not in all instances. To understand how the

3
 It IS to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed in
section 2.5.1 below. The determiner is more common when the head has the grammatical
relation of object.
                                                                 Abun relative clauses 58



determiner is used in locating the gap in the restricting clause several examples
are set out below. In (24) to (27) both the head and the relative conjunction
have been highlighted.        Further elements within the restricting clause are
underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted.                 Example (24)

shows the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.



(24) Men ki  nai         yu           do          suk    gat0 men ye        mo
     Ip  say lo.         REFLEX       COMP        things REL l p  difficult exist

              ne,   men       ku      re
     PERF     det   Ip        get     PERF
     'We said to each other that the things that we needed, we have gotten



In the following examples, (25) to (27), the omitted direct object is not the final
element of the relative clause, as is the case in (24) above where the determiner
ne closes the relative clause. In examples (25) and (26) there is a phrase which
follows the gap, an adjunct phrase in (25) and an indirect object phrase in (26).



(25) An       ndo   mo    ji              bi        nggon    subot ji         bi      buku
     3s      ask    to     Is             POSS      woman    about I s        P O S ~ book

     gat0     an    gre mo            bot
              3s    burn LOC          fire
     'He asked my wife about my book that she burned in the fire.'


(26) Pa    nut   do   an            ben        suk    mwa    gat0 an     bi   im
     child think COMP 3s            do         things many   REL  3s     POSS mother


     teach    lo    3s
     'The child thought that he (would) do the many things that his mother (had)
     taught to him.'

In example (27) below the word ka 'formlbody' actually is a reference to the
head of the relative clause within the restricting clause. In English this needs to
be translated as 'it's body' so that a pronoun replacing the head is now within the



                                                        ~-
                                                                 Abun relative clauses 59



    restricting clause. In these instances there is now actually no gap (created by
    the omission of the head) within the restricting clause because a word such as
I

I   ka refers to the head, which in this example has the grammatical relation of

    direct object. This creates no need for the determiner ne to be used.



    (27) Yen    kendo do  nu-fo       ne             nu    gat0
         people call COMP house-taboo DET            house REL

         Ye     me      ka   mo    nde
         people see     form exist NEG
         'People call it the sacred house, t13e house that must not be seen.'(or that
         people must not see the form of it.)'

    In all of these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct
    object, the determiner has not been used. The word order of these examples is
    sufficient to locate the gap, created by the omission of the head, since
    prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these cases the gap
    is not clause final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
    clause. Therefore whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some'kind
    within the structure of the restricting clause the determiner does not need to be
    used.   So a relativisation of the direct object may have the following
    composition:




    The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In
    example (28) below, the preposition su 'with' indicates a prepositional phrase.
    The gap is indicated by the presence of the preposition without the noun which
    normally accompanies it. Although the gap here is clause final it is part of the
    prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present so it is not necessary to use
         -                          --   -           -                 --




                                                                 Abun relative clauses



         there is another means through which the location of the gap may




(28) Suk-i           grto en         kembe          su      an      ye
     NOM-sick        REL     3s      weaf.out       with    3s      difficult
     teker          ware
     too. much      FRUST
     'The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it), so
     that she could not do anything.'

Example (29) is similar to example (28).


(29) Yen     fro        nggumwak ga        men sem                   mo
     people prepare room             REL   1p      sleep             LOC
     'The people prepared a room that we would sleep in.'

The way that the determiner is used can be shown in the following summary of
restricting clause types:


     HEAD = SUBJ              GAP + VERB f OBJECT f ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT

     HEAD = OBJ               SUBJ + VERB + GAP + DET

     HEAD = OBJ               SUBJ + VERB + GAP + ADJUNCT/C~MPLEMENT

     HEAD = OTHER             SUBJ + VERB + PREP + GAP4



Therefore it appears that the main function of the determiner is to locate the
position of the gap within the relative clause when the gap occurs in a clause
final position. Usually it is by word order that the gap is located within the
restricting clause. Since the determiner acts to close the clause like some kind
of boundary marker then it is still possible to locate the gap in these situations.
Givon (1990:659-60) stated that the gap strategy is most commonly found in
languages with rigid word order, as is the case with Abun. However, he felt that

  Probably the formula should contain f OBJECT, but no examples with an object occur in the
corpus.
                                                                     Abun relative clauses 61

                                                       w




"processing rate" would be longer in such languages as well as 'increased error
rate, and increased dependence on context' (Givon 1990:660ff). If there were
no boundary marker it would not be fully clear where the gap was and such
'increased errors' as Givon describes could arise. But the device of a boundary
marker behaves as another means for hearers to correctly encode what they
hear.4There are some instances where some speakers will use ne to close the
relative clause even though the gap is not clause final. It may be that they want
to add extra certainty that the relative clause is in fact closed.



2.5.2 Abun relative clauses and the Accessibility Hierarchy

Keenan and Comrie in their work on relative clauses (1977) devised a hierarchy
they called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a
wide sample of languages. They had investigated the types of constraints
across languages on which grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie
later refined this hierarchy so that 'The hierarchy subject > direct ob~ect> non-
direct object > possessor defines ease of accessibility to relative clause
formation.' (Comrie 1989:156). He stated that: if a language can form relative
clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on
all positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy.' (Comrie 1989:156).


How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy                       t




hold true for Abun? In section 2.5.1 above several examples were given which
showed that various positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in
Abun all positions on Comrie's Accessibility Hierarchy can be filled.

4
 It is my experience in living among Abun speakers that such errors that Givon imagines rarely
arise. Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations there are very
strong internal expectations in the mind of the hearer which are not necessary for languages
which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker
1s strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
negative constructions and in interrogatives and is discussed in detail in the paper by K.Berry
1995, Chapters 6 and 8.
                                                                 Abun relative clauses 62



    Keenan, when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to

1   form relative clauses noted that 'pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more
I


I   effective means of forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative
    pronoun) or gapping strategies' (Keenan 1985:156), since he considered that
    more positions along the hierarchy could be relativised when the pronoun was
    retained. Although Abun does not use a pronoun retaining strategy but rather
    uses a gap strategy this does not prevent a wide range of positions being
    relativised. There do not appear to be restrictions on relative clause formation
    in Abun. However the last level of the hierarchy, that of 'possessor', has limited
    formation possibilities in Abun. Examples (30) through to (37) below illustrate
    the formation sf relative clauses at different levels along the accessibility
    hierarchy.

Relativisation of Possessor

In section 1-6.4.3it was explained that a possessive phrase had the structure

                        POSSESSOR + bi   + POSSESSED


In a possessive phrase the possessor precedes the possessive linker bi which

in turn precedes that which is possessed. The following example shows that

gat0 may follow the possessor of a possessive noun phrase, making it possible

for the possessor to be relativised. In such structures the possessor of the
possessive phrase has been omitted.
                                                               Abun relative clauses 64


(37) Yan     gato bi  im                  mo    Arlince          ne      an     mu
     Yan     REL POSS mother              exist Arlince          DET     3s     go

     kagit kampung        r6
     from    village      this
     'Yan, whose mother is Arlince, he went from this village.'

This construction although possible is not common. It is most likely to be used
in response to a question. If a question was asked "Which Yan are you talking
about?" a reply such as Yan gat0 bi im mo Arlince ne 'Yan whose mother is
Arlince' is common.     However, this structure within a full sentence is not
preferred. Example (38) below would not be acceptable.


(38) *Harun gat0 bi        ai     mo Somm               kem      su   ji        bi
     Harun REL      POSS   father exist Sorom           live     with 1s        POSS

     im     do-wok                tepsu an       bi   pa    kon
     mother class-small           just.as3s      POSS child cook
     'Harun, whose father is Sorom, lives with my aunt as their adopted child.'

Instead this statement would be given as:


(39) Harun gat0 Sorom             bi     pa        ne   kern su
     Harun REL        Sorom       POSS child DET        live with
     'Harun, who is Sorom's child, lives with.. ....'

Therefore within a full or complete sentence as in example (39) it is not
acceptable to relativise the possessor. In an incomplete or partial sentence,
such as an answer to a question or as a modification of a noun in apposition to a
full clause, such as example (37),a relativisation of the possessor is possible. It
is only possible to relativise the possessor in limited circumstances. It is not
preferred as part of a complex sentence. This could be said to confirm that the
possessor position is the lowest on the hierarchy.
                                                              Abun relative clauses 65


2.6 'Adverbial' relative clauses

In Abun the relative clause may be used with a head which refers to the
adverbial concepts of time, location, and manner.           In Abun a subordinate

adverbial clause can be formed by means of the relative conjunction gato. Abun
does not possess adverb forms such as the English 'when', 'where' or 'how'
which may themselves act as conjunctions at the head of a subordinate
adverbial clause.    Instead a time word, another conjunction or a locative

preposition together with gat0 serve as the conjunctions in these cases.


In example (40) below sugato 'with that' has come to mean 'the time that' or
'when'. This is an adaptation of tepsu gat0 where tepsu means 'like' or 'just as'.
Tepsu gat0 is used as a general, non-speafic time expression in the same way

as the English 'when'.



(40) Sugato    Fredik     si   Pontius      mu   watbot  bus            an-we
     with.that Fredik     with Pontius      go   examine rope           3p-two

                                                                mo      bus
     find     wild.pig      one      DET.indef   struggle       in      rope
     'At the time that (when) Fredik and Pontius went to examine (their) rope
     (pig trap) they found a wild pig struggling in the rope.'


Another expression used to denote 'when' is tom gat0 'the time that'



(41) Ji      nuk-bot            tom gat0 yen            gu Yu        mo-re
     1s tell.story-about time REL people kill REFLEX                 at-here
     'I will tell about the time that there was fighting here.'

In example (42) below the general locative noun nat 'place' is modified or
relativised in exactly the same way as the non-locative noun nu 'house' in
example (43). In fact the English translation of (43) needs to omit any relative
marker and replace it with 'where' to make good sense but no such alternative
construction is available in Abun.
                                                                     Abun relative clauses 66


    (42) Men gwat mu-kom             mo nat        gat0 men gu nok              mo
         Ip    bring go-reach to            place REL l p         kill wild.pig exist
         'We brought (it) up to the place that we had killed the wild pig.'


    (43) Men mu kagit nu           gat0 men kra       su               mone
         IP go         from house REL l p      marry with              there
         'We went from the house where we were married.'

    In all these examples so far the construction used to form these subordinate
    adverbial clauses is identical to that of the relative clause. A head (usually a
    noun) is followed by the relative conjunction gato which is then followed by the
    subordinate, restricting clause. However, there are other instances of adverbial
    clauses where there is no identifiable head to make the structure comparable to
    a relative clause. In these cases two clauses are joined by gat0 combined with              I




    some other form. In examples (44) and (45) below the conjunction sa 'liketas'               E

    precedes gat0 to create an adverbial clause of manner.



    (44) An       da     ben    mo sarewo               an    yo       ben     kete
         3s       actual do     exist however           3s    NEG      do      too.much

         bado yo         teker          sa        gat0 nyim ne         nde     re
         maybe NEG       too.much       like      REL  earlier DET     NEG     PERF
         'Although she does (these things) she does not do (them) very much, I
         mean, not like (she did them ) before.'


    (45) Nggon we        but gre        nak       ge    we    sa       ga      ye
         woman two       catch frog     nak       CLASS two   like     REL     person

         we       but o
         two      catch again
         'The two women caught two 'nak' frogs in the same way that the two men
         (had) caught (two nak frogs earlier).'

    In examples (46) and (47) the locative mo 'at' precedes gato to create an

    adverbial clause of reason. Here the events expressed in the second clause
I
1   are the reason for the events of the first.
                                                             Abun relative clauses 67


(46) Ji       sa    ji      mbrin ji      waiyu       mo       gat0 wo-kwai
     Is       laugh I s     faint I s     turn.around at       REL  fish-kwai

     tik      Sepenyel      gwes or   ges        ne
     pull     Sepenyel      leg  then fall       that
     'I laughed so much I rolled around at the eel pulling on Sepenyel's leg (so
     that he) fell over there.' (The eel was tied on to the leg.)


(47) Ji    maskwa Musa mo gat0 an gu Rahayu bi               im
     I s angry      Musa at REL 3s hit Rahayu POSS mother
     'I was angry with Musa at him hitting Rahayu's mother.'

These types of construction can only be translated in English, not as
subordinate adverbial clauses, but as nomina!ised complements. Example (47)
could also be expressed as example (48) below and both are equally
acceptable.



(48) Ji   maskwa      Musa we         an gu       Rahayu bi             im
     1s be.angry Musa because 3s hit              Rahayu POSS           mother
     'I was angry with Musa because he hit Rahayu's mother.'

Perhaps in these cases the clause that follows mo gat0 does not represent an
adverbial clause of reason because no conjunction which indicates reason such
as we 'because' has been used. Rather an additional clause has been joined
into the sentence by means of the locative preposition mo in exactly the same
way that a locative phrase would be joined to the clause.            In Abun with
predicates such as sa 'laugh' and maskwa 'be angry' additional arguments may
be required in the clause to indicate not the object of these predicates but rather
the reason behind the action. If this reason is expressed as a full clause, the

clause is embedded into the main clause by the dual means of the locative
preposition mo and the relative conjunction @05.

The concept of prepositions which behave as conjunct~onswill be developed further in
Chapter 5.
                                                                  Abun relative clauses 68



In these types of example we find that gat0 is used in clauses that could not be
described as restrictive relative clauses. Wherever sa gato and mo gat0 are
used they appear to join clauses rather than modify a head. In these cases the
clauses that follow gato are full clauses. There is no gap in these clauses
because they are not relative clauses. It was discussed earlier that gato was a
relative conjunction rather than a relative marker (section 2.3.3). It seems then
that in its function as a conjunction gat0 may join subordinate clauses to larger
structures, even though these are not relative clauses and are adverbial in
meaning.

                                                                                             j

relative clause. These types of clause, due to the non-referential nature of the
head, I have termed indefinite relative clauses to distinguish them from relative            r




clauses of the regular variety.      Structurally they differ from regular relative

clauses in that only the noun modifying particle to is used, rather than the
relative conjunction gat0 and they do not require the use of the determiner, as in
example (49).

Huddleston terms the English equivalent of this type of construction a 'fused                    B
relative' construction to distinguish it from other types of relative clause. In
English a non-specific referent is marked by some type of wh phrase, by means
of whoever, what or where (Huddleston 1984:403). Givon also finds these types
                                                             Abun relative clauses 69



of relative problematic since they do not line up with his semantic definition of a
restrictive relative clause, namely that 'A relative clause codes a proposition one
of whose participants is coreferential with the head noun that is modified by that
clause.' (Givon 1990:646) If the head noun is non-referential then there cannot
be strict referential identity since many of these relative constructions concern
hypothetical situations or unknown situations.


In Abun the fact that these are a different type of relative construction is
grammatically marked. Abun is a language in which it is important to mark the
distinction between that which is real and known and that which is hypothetical
and unknown. Normally within the noun phrase if any information in a sentence
is not given (that is already known) then the determiner yo 'indefinite, alan' is
used in conjunction with the noun concerned. Therefore Abun grammar marks
the fact that nouns may refer to either actual entities or hypothetical ones.
When a noun represents the head of a relative clause it is important in Abun to
mark this noun so that it can be interpreted as referring to some specific known
referent or to some hypothetical entity.


It was explained earlier that the relative conjunction was composed of two

morphemes, the particles ga and to.        In section 2.3.2 the particle ga was
explained as serving to identify or mark the head of the relative clause as a
specific referential identity. In the types of construction described as indefinite
relative clauses the noun of the head has no real world semantic referent at the
time of utterance. There may be a range of possible referents but none that is
specific or known. Therefore this noun cannot be modified by ga. The simple
solution in Abun is that these nouns are modified by the general subordinating
particle to only. Since ga is absent it is obvious that these nouns have no
specific referent and are therefore interpreted as non-referential. In English the
                                                                     Abun relative clauses 70



     same constructions need the addition of 'any' or 'ever' to make this clear, as
     examples (50) and (51) indicate.

     These indefinite relative clauses also differ from regular restrictive clauses in
     that no determiner is used. The determiner has been described as a device for
     assisting hearers is locating the gap within the restricting clause thereby
     decreasing the likelihood of possible error (see 2.5.1). Since in these cases the
1
     head is non-referential with no specific referent intended there is no possibility of

If   error. If there is no specific referent intended then no mistake in encoding can
     be made. Hence the determiner is not needed in this relative clause type.



     2.8 Non-restrictive relative clauses

     Non-restrictive relative clauses are less common than restrictive relative
     clauses. They have two main structural differences from the restrictive clause

     type.    Firstly, the relative conjunction is to, the general noun subordinating
     particle. Secondly, all non-restrictive relative clauses must be closed by the

                                                                                          i
                                                                                          i

boundary marker, the determiner ne. There are several reasons for this. The
non-restrictive relative clause is structurally different from the indefinite relative
clause in that the determiner is used in the non-restrictive type.         In a non-
restrictive relative clause the semantic content 'is presented as a separate piece
of information.' (Huddleston 1984401) It is a type of parenthetical insertion not
essential to the speaker's main communication. It can be easily seen that in
Abun the conjunction to and the determiner ne are thc parentheses which
bracket the additional information which has been included within the main
clause. So the determiner is an essential element in this clause type because
the hearer must know when the inserted or additional information ends.
Example (52),given earlier in this chapter as example (4) shows how both to
and ne bracket additional information which has been included for the hearers'
benefit.



(52) An        ki    nai    Martinus       to-re         to      kra   Domingas\
      3s       say   10     Martinus       DEIC-this     REL     marry Domingas

      ne       bi   ai     gum do    Simam               Yorfen do
      DET      POSS father name COMF Simam               Yorfenco~~
      'He said to Martinus' father (the Martinus (who lives) here, who married
      Domingas) (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that.. .'

Examples (53) and (54) also show the non-restrictive clause type as additional
information.


(53) Na      me fen            dik     yo          to    nor    ne      bur
     2s      see sea.turtle one D ~ ~ . i n d e fREL float DET          down
      'Look at that turtle which is floating (around) down there!'


( 5 4 ) An    ndo-bot   suqit  dik yo               to men ye     bok
        3s    ask-about Noweat one D ~ ~ . i n d e fREL Ip people several

      'He asked about some (kinds of) fwd, which all of us would eat.
                                                                     Aburi relative clauses 72



In example (54) there is another structural difference which may occur with this
type of clause. Because the clause is added or non-essential information the
head of the relative clause has actually been retained within the non-restricting
clause so that there is no gap as there would be in the restricting kind. This
kind of construction has only been found within the non-restrictive type.


There appear to be limitations also as to those positions which may be filled on
the accessibility hierarchy by the non-restrictive relative clause.                  While it
appears that both a subject and direct object can be relativised in this way it
appears that positions lower an the hierarchy cannot.                The example below,
given as example (28) in section 2.5.2 is a relativisation of a non-direct object
for a restrictive clause. When exactly the same information is presented in a
non-restrictive form, as in example (56) below, it actually becomes a
relativisation of a ~ u b j e c t .Since
                                   ~     the non-restrictive relative clause is the less
frequent type this restriction is not surprising.



(55) Suk-i             gat0 an         kamba           su       an      ye
     NOM-sick          REL  3s         wear.out        with     3s      difficult

     'The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it), so
     that she could not do anything.'

(56) Suk-i        to ben an ne        ben     an kamba        teker
     NOM-sick REL do       3s DET make 3s worn.out too.much
     'The sickness, which she had, made her really worn out.'

In summary, non-restrictive relative clauses are used by speakers of Abun.

There is not always a noticeable phonological pause as in English.                        But
speakers must bracket or delineate the boundary of the clause by to and ne.

'The clause suki ben an 'lit. the sickness did her' is the Abun cultural way of expressing that
 she got or had a sickness. In Abun thinking whatever is more powerful or stronger must be
made the subject of the sentence.

The same information when put into both a restrictive and non-restrictive form
may sometimes be structurally quite different since a non-restrictive clause may

be removed from the main clause. The main clause will be able to stand on its
own structurally complete. This is not the case with a restrictive relative clause
because it is subordinate to the main clause and its inclusion is necessary for
the communication to be complete.

This concludes the discussion of Abun relative clause types.
                                                                             -   --   -   --

3. Complement Clauses

3.0 Abun complement clause types

This chapter describes the type of subordinate clause which has been described
as sentential complementation. Sentential complementation has been defined
as 'the syntactic situation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is
an argument of a predicate.' (Noonan 1985:42). In this chapter this type of
complementation will be referred to simply as a complement clause or as a
complement, but with the meaning of sentential complementation. It can be
difficult to distinguish complement clauses from adjunct clauses (see discussion
in Section 3.1.4). Except where it is clear that we are dealing with an adjunct, I
will use the term 'complement'.


In Abun there are only two types of complement clause:

1     those that are preceded by the complementizer do.

2     those that do not take the complementizer.

This chapter discusses both types of complement clause in detail and looks at
further possibilities where some complement taking predicates are capable of
both complement types. The means of identifying complement clause types will
be shown to be found outside of the complement clause, rather than within it.



3.1 Complementizer do

The purpose of the complementizer is to identify the subordinate clause it
precedes as a complement. Abun has only one complementizer and it is the
free form particle do. Do precedes the complement clause, just as the relative
clause conjunction gat0 precedes the relative clause. According to Noonan
'complementizers typically derive historically from pronouns, conjunctions,
                                                       Abun complement clauses 75



adpositions or case markers...' (Nwnan 1985:47) In Abun the homophonous
do-'some of has various functions such as do-gato 'the oneslthose who', do-yo
'some of, do-wok 'the small one' and (warn) do-gn 'the third (time)'. While these
could possibly be related to the complementizer do, another more likely origin is
from a verb du 'to speak'. In the Abun Ji dialect the complementizer is usually
pronounced as du (a few speakers use dudo). Du appears to be obsolescent
verb meaning 'to say, to speak', still evident in the noun suk-du lit. NOM-speak
'story, news' and the verbs duwe 'say, teach', dumu 'grumble' and duwer 'argue
against'. In present day Abun the verb to say is ki. Du 'to say' could have
become a complementizer. This happens in some other languages. In Thai, for
instance, wda 'to speak' has become a complementizer introducing direct and
indirect speech. As we see in the following section do introduces complements
of predicates expressing speech and thought.


3.1.1 The use of the complementizer do

The complementizer do may be used with a wide variety of predicates in Abun.
Do is used after predicates which express utterance, attitude, pretence,
knowledge and distribution. Any verb which expresses speaking, thinking or
knowing is capable of taking a complement preceded by do. These types of
complement always function as the object in Abun.        When do precedes a
complement clause, this clause is always a complete clause. Various examples
of Abun complement-taking predicates are described below.


     Utterance predicates


In Abun predicates which express some type of verbal utterance or
communication use the complementizer do. This is the most common form of
complement. The following examples show predicates representing different
types of communication.
                                                             Abun complement clauses 76

      'He shouted "Yorfen, please help me!"

In Abun the difference between direct and indirect quotation is not marked in the
syntax.      This difference is not achieved by a pause or absence of a
complementizer but rather a difference in the personal pronouns used. Example
                                                             Abun complement clauses 77



    (7) below shows an indirect quotation. The pronouns used in this example
    appear unusual from an English speaker's perspective, in that within the
i   quotation the addressee is referred to as a 'you', but the speaker is referred to




    (7) An        tom           ji     do     a      mu     nde    yo            a
        3s        arrange        Is    COMP   2s     go     NEG    then.l~R      2s

          kern    wade ber nom re             an     ma   watbot          or
          stay    until later night this      3s     come examine         thorough

          et
          SUBJ
          'He arranged with me that "Don't go, you stay until later tonight and he
          would come and examine (you) thoroughly."'

    The use of pronouns in this way indicates that this is an indirect quotation
    because the speaker is referred to in the third person. This 'unusual' mix of
    pronouns is common in Abun reported speech. Example (8) below is also an
    indirect quote. Again the only means of identifying it as such is by the pronouns
    used and not by some other syntactic device.



    (8)   Yen    kendo          men    do   men      gwat men      bi   suk e
          people call           Ip     COMP 1p       bring 1p      POSS things and

          men     grem
           IP     Put
          'They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).'

    The pronouns of example (8) are in the first person rather than in the second
    person which would be the normal situation if this was a direct quote of a
    request or command.


    Predicates which express force or manipulation, if they are verbal in nature take
    do in the same way as other utterance predicates.          So the verbs syaugat
I
                                                           Abun complement clauses 78


'command' and the weaker syogat 'orderltell' behave as other utterance

predicates when taking a complement.



             syaugat        men-ka-we do   men-ka-we ki                 sukdu

     Attitude Predicates


These types of predicate refer to the state of mind of an actor in a narrative or
story rather than what that person might say. These predicates refer to various
mental states such as 'think', 'imagine' 'dream' and 'intend'.



             nut do     an         bi   obat               ne    nggi wa       be

Various emotional states are also included in this type of predicate. In examples
(15) and (16) below the stative verbs maskwa 'be angry' and nokwa 'be worried

about' take the complementizer do.


(15) Supanyel     mask-wa         do   Regina ben siri       su     nje  '

     Supanyel angry-TRANS COMP Regina do               wrong with people
     'Supanyel was angry that Regina committed adultery a number of times.'

            worry-TRANSCOMP later people             say       3s    name bad
     'He was worried that people would slander him.'

Likewise i 'be happy' may take complementizer do.


(17) Yen     sino i             do    an     kra su      ye-gwes-wai
     people all    be.happy     COMP 3s      mary with PERS-leg-pass
     'Everyone was happy that she was to marry a (man who was a) mediator.'

However, the verbs iwa 'want' (lit. happy-TRANS)and bariwa 'not want, not like'
do not behave in the same way. These verbs do not appear to take the
complementizer do. For instance, it is not possible to say the following:


(18) *Ji   1-wa            do    ji    tu      n8u     wa ji         da

    The correct form is example (19) below where no complementizer is used at all.
    This is actually a complement of a different type and will be described further in
I   section 3.2.


    (19) Ji    i-wa                         nau        wa ji          da

also take the complementizer.

     Predicates of division


The last type of predicate which may take the complementizer do is somewhat

different to the others. The other predicates include those of communication,
mental activity, thoughts and some emotions all of which are associated with an
experiencer. However, predicates of division require an agent. Whether the
predicate expresses a division of goods or a division of labour the account of

how the div~sionoccurred is preceded by the complementizer. Example (26)
describes a division of goods and example (27) a division of labour.

    It is unusual in Abun for a predicate which involves some kind of physical action
    involving an agent to take the complementizer except for predicates of division
    described above. There are some exceptions to this.           Example (28) below
    involves the verb sokbot 'to look over'. Such a verb does not normally entail a
                                                        Abun complement clauses 83



complement. However in the example below the action of 'looking over' resulted
in a thought and it is actually the actor's thought which is preceded by do. The

expression 'I thought that' has been omitted.



                           do   Moses           syim ga          bi   nggo"
             look-along    COMP Moses           a m REL          POSS woman

     sap     ana   u     ne?
             FOCUS which FQM
     'I looked all over (thinking) that " Which one of Moses' arms did his wife
     cutlstrike?"

In example (29) below the verb kadum 'show' means 'explain'. Since in this
case it is acting as a verb of communication it also takes do.



(29) Bere    ji     dakai kadum          an     do   an          gwat ji     bi

     'Soon I myself will showlexplain to him that he will take my message and
     go and say (it) to many people.'

Likewise there are some instances where a statement is made and then an
explanation is made of this statement.     In these instances do precedes the
explanation in the same way that do preceded a description of a division of
labour or goods. In these cases do is equivalent to the English 'in that' , as
shown in the example below:



(30) Sane    men    kem    mo     nden ware do      yenggras          ne     ba
     SO      Ip     stay   at     jungle in.vainco~polder.man         that   go

    out there and carried all our things back to here.'

3.1.2 Use of do preceding less than a full clause

  was stated above that do identified a complement ;lnd that this was always a
full clause. There are cases where do does     PC    :-            d   full clause. Where
this is the case, the complement consists ot ,       i    -        :n phrase only. One
instance of this will be looked at under section    : ..-      'doun complementation'.
The following examples show cases where a phrase and not a clause follows

the complementizer.



             bi      yenggras      nut      do    suk-i
             poSs older.people think COMP NOM-sick
     'Her older relatives thought that (it was) a sickness.


                           do   ye-kampung bad0 gane-yo
                         COMP PE~~-viilage     ALT    there-indef
     'He assumed that perhaps (they were) villagers from some place.'

In example (33) below the predicate kendo 'call' is used in the sense of giving a
name. The complement, which is the name or title barn or 'master' shaman,
consists only of this noun phrase.



(33) An    kendo do         yewon      barn     An            bi   ye-guru
                    COMP    shaman     bam      3p            POSS PERS-teacher




     'They are called 'bam' or 'master' shamans.              That is (they are) their
     teachers.'

Names are considered as complements and will be looked at in the next section.



3.1.3 Noun complementation

The previous discussion listed the various predicate types which may take
complements in Abun. Some nouns may take complements also and where this
                                                               Abun complement clauses 85



     is the case the complementizer do is used. Noun complementation is limited to

     two types: describing names and describing thoughts.


          Complement taking nouns: Naming


     In order to give a name for a place or a person the complementizer always
     precedes the name given. The noun head which takes the complement consist;'
     of an inalienable possessive phrase of which the noun gum 'name' is a part. In
     these cases the complement does not consist of a full clause but only the noun
     phrase describing the name.



     (34) Nggon ne     gum do      Edia Yesia
          woman DET name COMP Edia Yesia
          'The woman's name was Edia Yesia.'

     Only when an actual name is given is the complernentizer used. Titles or social
     position are not considered names and so in these cases the complementizer do
     is not used, as in example (35) below.



     (35) Erensi bi        ai   gat0 kwop ne         tom ne          gum yesan to
          Erensi Poss father REL die          DET    time DET name chief still
          'Erensi's father who has since died was at that time still the village leader.'
     or    'had the name of village leader.'

          Complement taking nouns: Thoughts


     Thoughts and plans may also take complements. The conceptual thought or
     plan may be expressed by means of a noun phrase, having the structure of
     structure of a possessive phrase. The complernents described here differ from
     naming complements in that the complement in these cases always consists of

i!   a full clause, not just a single noun phrase.
                                                         Abun complement clauses 86



(36) An      wa     bi   suk-jimnot      i        do     an   wa     kra Andar
     3s      FOC    POSS NOM-think       own      COMP   3s   FOC    marry Andar

     kagit    Lamber
     from     Lamber
     His particular plan (was) that he would marry Andar rather than Lamber.'

Occasionally the stative particlelverb may follow the possessive phrase as in
example (37) below; however, it is more usual for this to be omitted. Sukjimnot
'thought, plan, intention' appears to be the only Abun noun which may take
complements in this way.



(37) An bi        suk-jimnot mo        do    bere an ma       gu      Lamber
     3s POSS NOM-think exist COMP later 3s come kill                  Lamber
     'His thinking was that later he would come and kill Lamber.'


3.1.4 Complement clause structure in Abun

When a subordinate clause is a complement it is common for the complement to
function as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded.
In Abun complements may function as objects of a clause and this type of
complement will be described under section 3.2.           However, the type of
subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those that use the
complementizer do, do not funciion in this way.


When the complementizer is used, the constituent that follows does not function
as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here

to support this analysis:

     (1) A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.

     (2) When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct
          object.

     (3) Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique
thing   this

   OBJECT

                             CLAUSE


     'He said something to me that I should leave this place quickly.'

The embedded clause of (41) is in apposition to the object suk 'thing'. It is an
expansion of the object or gives clear content to it. It is certainly not common to
have a structure as full as this but (41) shows that if there is a do-clause it
occurs after the object and indirect object if these constituents are present. In
(41) the object, here suk 'thing', is a generic non-specific noun without any

known or specific content until the do-clause is given. Because the do-clause is
a more internally complex constituent than a single noun such as suk, the
placing of the do-clause in sentence final position, rather than immediately
following the object, is an example of the heavy-to-the-right movement principle.
This principle of word order evident in many languages shifts larger complex
units to the right, that is towards the end of the sentence, to reduce burden on
the short term memory (Mallinson and Blake: 1981 151,156ff).


Examples (42). (43) and (44) below are also typical ot the types of sentence
which contain do-clauses in addition to direct objects.

           Abun word order is such that if there is a prepositional phrase then this follows                       R

           the indirect object and it is the final constituent of the clause. If the clause
           contains no prepositional phrase then the indirect object is the final constituent.
           In example (45) below the do-clause occurs after an indirect object. Since in
           Abun a direct object never follows an indirect object it is not possible that the do-
           clause of this example could be considered to function as the object of the main
           clause.                                                                                                       I

           Likewise in example (46) below, given earlier as example (5)) the do-clause
           follows a prepositional phrase.

           It 1s not possible to have the direct object following a prepositional phrase.                     !

         Syntactic restrictions


    Since the predicates 'want' and 'believe' cannot allow negative raising due to
    lexical restrictions, the only other predicate eligible for negative raising in Abun

I   would be nut 'think'. Examples of negative raising with this predicate are not
    found in Abun. The following examples show a complement clause containing a
    negative (47) and then an unacceptable sentence where this negative has been
    'raised' (48).



    (47) Ji       nut     do    ji     yo     ku     nan gro        o     nde
         Is       think COMP IS NEG meet 2s                 eye     again NEG
         'I thought that I would not see you (ever) again.'


    (48) *Ji      yo       nut    do     ji     ku    nan gro       o     nde
         Is        NEG think COMP I s           meet 2s       eye   again NEG
         'I did not think that I would (ever) see you again.'

    Example (48) is unacceptable for a number of reasons. One of these reasons is
    due to an Abun negative being formed by two negative particles rather than only
    one. The dual negative particles that are used in Abun must bracket or enclose
    the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar terms) or predicate (in
    traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the subject).
    Because of this any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
    included within the grammatical scope of the negation.           This means that       6
    although it is the verb of the matrix clause that is being negated the final           +
    negative particle will not occur until after the subordinate clause. The following
    example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is of the relative type, with   5
    the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause without         i
                                                                                           ?
                                                                                           f
    negating the relative clause itself.
                                                           Abun complement clauses 93



    (49) An       yo     ki      su-gato    ibit   subot nan mb         nde
                 NEG say thing-REL bad about 2s                   exist NEG
         'They did not say anything that was bad about you at all.'

    In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in (48) only
    one negative particle will move, the particle yo, in order to negate the matrix           l!I
    verb nut 'think'.   Due to the structure and word order of complex negative
    constructions in Abun it is not possible to shift the second negative particle nde
    and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word order do not allow this.
    Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of negation is
    syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
    clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles both of these
    cannot be 'raised' from the complement clause.


    However, there is a second syntactic restriction which disallows negative raising
    in Abun. The type of predicate described in 3.1.1 above are rarely negated in        il
                                                                                         t



    such a way as to contain a subordinate, complement clause. Perhaps these
    structures are considered too clumsy or lengthy. Therefore the majority of
    complement predicates are not negated in this way, let alone the small subset             Fr
                                                                                              i
    which is said to allow negative raising in other languages. If these verbs are            t
                                                                                         i    p

    negated it is usually in the form of simple sentences without complements as

it is very uncommon to find a matrix clause that is negated in which the

subordinate clause is of the complement type. The examples below show some
of the few instances where a negated complex sentence contains a




(53) Moses yo       ki    gad0 an        kra   su     Banbarina    o     nde
     Moses NEG say eadier 3s             marry with Barbarina      again NEG
     'Moses did not say earlier that he would marry Barbarina again.'


(54) Men       bi   yenggras          jam nde          an      bi   nji
               POSS elders             know NEG        3p      POSS brother

     Kasmowon          TOP PEW-head at                 river-Bun
     'Our older relatives did not know that their brother Kasmowon was the one
     who was the head man at Bun ~iver.'*

It can be seen here that although these complex sentences do contain a

complement the complementizer do is not used.                   Example (55) below is
structurally equivalent to (54) the only difference being that the verb of the
matrix clause is positive and not negative.



(55) Yesan ben        suk re           subere         Yen             jam do
     chief do         thing this       so.that        people           know C ~ M P

     'The chief did these things so that people knew that Wonsuwis was an
     important person.'

  Example (48) uses the verb jam nde 'not know' Thls verb behaves irregularly when ~t 1s In the
negative In that ~t does not always use the second negative particle yo (compare example (47)
It 1s the author's oplnlon that jam nde 'not know' has come to behave as ~f ~t were a s~ngle
lexical form In the same way as the ~nherentlynegatlve word ban 'not want' This accounts for
the irregular pattern found in (48) whereby the negative particle nde occurs lrnmed~atelyafter
the matrix clause verb rather than after the embedded clause whlch is the normal pattern Thls
devlatlon only occurs w ~ t hthe verb jam.
                                                                      Abun complement clauses 95



    In an indicative sentence the complementizer do is used. Yet the change to
    negative results in the complementizer being omitted.                    This leads to the
    conclusion that Abun speakers do not use the complementizer in complex
    negative      construction^.^     On this basis example (48) which retained the
    cornplementizer is incorrect. These structural limitations show that negative
    raising is not possible in Abun.



    3.2 Embedded complements

    The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
    complementizer. For want of a better label I have called these complements
    'embedded'. There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have
    a complementizer: those which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and

    those which involve some type of force, that is a manipulative predicate. These
    semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type of verb suffix used. Attitudinal
    predicates make use of the suffix -wa, whiie those indicating some sort of force
    or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which do not
    use a complementizer are iwa 'want' and bariwa 'not.want/dislike', being
    attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuadelpressurise' and kmkgat 'annoylstir
    up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be later in
    the chapter.


    The following examples illustrate these complement types.



    (56) An       i-wa         ji    jam      mo an            sor
         3s      ~~P~Y-TRAN     1sS listen to 3s               only

         'We do not force other tribes t do these things.'

    In other languages, besides Abun, a different predicate type can mean a
    different complement type. For instance Givon states that it is 'more common to
    find subordinating morphemes in complements of cognition-utterance verbs, as
    compared with manipulative or modality verbs.' (1990553) Givon's categories
    roughly compare to the Abun categories described above. All Abun utterance
    predicates use the complementizer (his 'subordinating morpheme') when the
    complement is intended to refer to direct speech.4 His 'modality' predicates
    ~ncludethe verb 'want' which is under discussion here and also other verbs
    which are not in the class of verbs for               bun.'     In English attitudinal and
    manipulative predicates are distinguished by having a complement of an
    infinitival structure.    Utterance predicates have complements which use a
    subordinating conjunction 'that'. Givon further distinguished predicates such as
    English 'want' and the manipulative predicate 'orde:'                 in that the infinitival
    complements of these verbs could not tolerate further embedded clauses such
    as relative clauses, clefts etc (1979:68). In Abun these predicates likewise take

    complements that are structurally quite different from the 'utterance predicates'
    and others described in section 3.1 above. The manipulative predicate ben

I   'make', discussed later, does not take a complementizer. A predicate such as
    'LET'does not have a distinct lexical form in Abun and is always rendered as iwa

    'happy to.' Likewise the predicate 0s-wa 'help', although not a desiderative
    predicate, makes use of the suffix -wa to indicate an embedded complement

    clause. For example:



    (60) Sane   Markus        0s-wa         duno an
i        SO     Markus        help
         'So Markus helped to teach her.'
                                            teach 3s



    Besides not taking the complementizer do these complement types are
    structurally different in another important way.     These complement types
    function as the object of the main clause. On the other hand those which use a
    complementizer do not, as was shown in section 3.1.4 earlier. The complement

I   clauses of 3.1 were described as fitting in to Abun sentence structure in the
I   following way:


1   SUBJECT + VERB + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT)   + (DO + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)

    The complement clause types under discussion here are strucuturally quite
    different.   These complement clauses function as the object and so the
    sentence has the following
                             - structure:

                               SUBJECT + VERB+ OBJECT


    Earlier, example (41) above was shown in such a way that its constituent
    structure was fully described. If example (56) is repeated in the same way the
    structural difference between the complement types is more clear.

    it is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not possible to have
    a participial complement. Neither iS there an infinitive in Abun.


    Determining what is an infinitive for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such
    definitions are usually based on variations of the basic verb showing person-
    number marking of the subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is
    invariant since changes to aspect and mood are carried by particles and
    subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an infinitive is said to be a
    verb that is 'not able to take a subject NP' this definition is also problematic
    because verbs in Abun normally take a subject NP. In Abun verbs are never
    said in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for
    such words as 'come' 'go' etc the reply is always given using a personal
    pronoun, usually second person singular. Therefore 'come' would be given as
    na ma 'you come' and 'go' would be given as na mu 'you go'. An infinitive

    cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.            On some
    occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted but this is an option the
    speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may
    allow the subject of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with
    the subject of the main clause. For example



    (61) Ji      i-wa          cia     ron        a-re
          Is     happy-TRANSdrink medicine        FOC-this
         'I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.'

    This type of ellipsis is not common, as it is more usual that the subject is
    repeated. In either case the form of the verb is the same whether there is a
    subject NP or not. Therefore it is not possible to determine what is an infinitive
    verb form in Abun. Since Abun verb niorphology is always invariant it cannot be
    stated that Abun has a separate infinitive verb form. Neither does it have a
I
L
    Participial form. It follows then that because Abun has no verbal infinitives,
!
                                                      Abun complement clauses 101,



neither can it have infinitive complements. Therefore this means of encoding a
complement clause by means of distinctive verb morphology is not applicable for
Abun. Because changes to verb morphology within the complement clause
cannot identify complement types this means that other methods need to be

used.


Givon did not list any other means of syntactically encoding a complement
clause. The various means that he has described with the exception of the
"subordinating morpheme" are all means of identifying the complement clause
as a complement clause by some type of syntactic marking within the
complement clause itself. These means have proved unproductive for Abun .
Noonan, like Givon, lists various ways of identifying complement clauses and he
lists one means being 'the external syntactic relations of the complement
construction as a whole.' (1985:44) It seems that for Abun the only way of
identifying complement clauses is not from within the embedded complement
clause but outside of it. One means that is external to the complement clause is
the complementizer.    If there is no complementizer as in the cases under
discussion here, there is other 'external evidence' which can indicate that the
complement clause is embedded within the main clause. There are various
structural indications of subordination in Abun and two of them will be given here
to provide evidence that these complement clauses are in fact subordinate to

the main clause as embedded objects. The first deals with the structure of a
negative sentence and the second concerns the transitive implications of the
suffixes on the main clause verbs found in these types of construction.



3.2.1.2 Negation of complex sentences

It has already been shown in regard to negative raising (3.1.5)
                                                              that a clause can
be shown to be subordinate by the placement of the negative particle nde. If a
                                                          Abun complement clauses 102



main clause is to be negated the negative particle nde only occurs after any
subordinate clause which may be embedded within that main clause. Example
(59) given earlier, and repeated belmv is an example of this and has a
manipulative verb (verb with -gat suffix) in the main clause.



(59) Men     yo   .   wergat        ye- wis          Y;     ben-bot     suk re
     IP      NEG      force         p ~ ~ s - k i n d other do-about    thing this
     nde
     NEG
     'We do not force other tribes to do these things.'

Example (62) below shows the other type of verb under consideration here,
verbs which may take -wa suffix, and the pattern of negation is the same. The

subordinate clause, in these cases complement clauses which do not have a
complementizer, is within the grammatical scope of the main clause negation.



(62) Men    yo      nyu-wa        men mu            ki    suk-du        re     nde
     1P      NEG fear-TRANS lj3            90       Say   NOM-Say       this   NEG
     'We are not afraid to go and tell this story.'

The syntax of these examples indicates that these types of complement are in
fact subordinate because the final negative particle nde occurs after the

complement. In order to create two separate assertions in Abun, each clause
would need to have both negative particles in the correct positions, using a total
of four particles in all rather than the two only that are used in these examples.
Although there is an absence of any other form of syntactic marking to indicate
that there is a complement clause embedded here, the presence of only two

negative particles indicates that only one verb has been negated and that is the
verb of the main clause. The second clause must be an embedded clause
because the position of the second negative particle nde indicates that this
clause is included within the scope of the main clause negation. Because there
                                                               Abun complement clauses 103



are only two negative particles there can only be one sentence here. Therefom
on the basis of the structure of the indicative negative, these complement
clauses are subordinate.'



3.2.1.3 Transitive nature of the -wa suffix

The purpose of the -wa suffix is to indicate that a part of speech, usually a verb
that is not normally transitive is transitive in the utterance given. Therefore -wa
changes the valency of the verb from having only one argument to two. Usually
-wa changes stative verbs into transitive verbs and some of these, namely iwa
'want', bariwa 'do not want' and nyuwa 'be afraid of are capable of taking the
types of complements under discussion here. Any verb which has the -wa suffix
is transitive even if the object is not overtly stated. The following examples
indicate this.



(63) Nu       nyu      nde
     2~       fear     NEG
     'Don't fear. '


(64) Nu       nyu-wa         men o      nde
     2~       fear-TRANS 1p       again NEG
     'Don't be afraid of us any more.'


(65) *Nu      nyu men o          nde
     2~       fear . ~p    again NEG
     *'Don't fear us any more.'




'The placement of the final negative particle is also significant in another way. In the simple
Abun clause only aspect particles or interrogative particles may follow the final negative
Particle. Therefore a constituent such as 'Adjunct' may not follow after the negative particle.
Thus the constituent structure given for these sentences cannot include an adjunct and is
 limited to the pattern SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT.
                                                       Abun complement clauses 104



(66) JI      nut   do   an        bi   obat nggi wa            be    an      gu
     Is      think COMP 3s        POSS magic strong for        later 3s      kill

     Is      this   So   1s       f e a r - ~ ~ just
                                                 ~ ~ s
     'I thought that his magic was strong enough to kill me. So I was just afraid
     (of him).


The significance of example (65) is that a stative verb like nyu 'fear' cannot take
an object unless the -wa has been added as in (64). Therefore example (65) is
unacceptable since an object foilows the stative verb nyu. Frequently Abun
speakers use verbs which have had -wa added and omit the object which -wa
implies. Normally the object is understood from the immediate context. This is
the case in example (66) above.         The preceding sentence to the clause
containing nyuwa 'be afraid of has been given so that it can be seen that the
object is understood or omitted.       The implications of this for complement
structures are that -wa indicates that the verb must take an object and that in
these cases the object is actually the entire clause, as indicated in the example
below.



(67) An    i-wa                ji      si    an          mu   mo      nggwe
    3s     be.happy-TRANS I s          with 3s           go   to      garden
    'She wanted me to go with her to the garden.'


The structure of (67) differs from example (39). here repeated as example (68).
In (68) the complementizer and the complement clause are not the object of the
verb i 'be happy' because i is an intransitive verb. Therefore the do-clause does
not have the grammatical relation of object (as shown in section 3.1.4 above).



(68) Yen     sino i      do     an    kra    su    ye-gwes-wai
     people all    happy COMP 3s      marry with P E R S - ~ ~ ~ - ~ ~ S S
     'Everyone was happy that she was to marry a (man who was a) mediator.'
                                                       Abun complement clauses 105             I

Because the clauses of the type similar to that of example (67) function as
                                                                                               f;
objects they must be understood as complements even though no                                  !

complementizers are used. These clauses are therefore embedded clauses.                        I




                                                                                               !

Having shown that these complement clauses are subordinate, even though
they possess no overt grammatical marking to indicate this status, the second
claim is that these embedded clauses function as the object of the complement
taking predicate. In one sense this might seem obvious since a complement
                                                                                                   ,
clause is by definition a notional object of some predicate and in the structures
                                                                                      t

             'We are not afraid to go and tell this story.'

        For these two examples, given earlier as (59) and (62) respectively, the entire
        complement clause (underlined) is considered to be the object of the
        complement taking predicates. Thus the object of wergat 'force' in (69) is
        yewis yi ben suk r6 'other tribes do these things' and in (70) the object of the
        verb nyuwa 'be afraid of' is men mu ki sukdu rd 'we go and tell this story1.8


        However, it could be posited that the entire embedded clause is not the object
        of the complement taking verbs but rather a single noun phrase only, namely
        yewis yi 'other tribes' in (69) and men 'we' in (70). This would appear to be

        appropriate with manipulative verbs like wergat 'to force' where the person
        forced is an argument of the verb. However, this type of constituent division
        poses a few problems. Because Abun has no case marking to put a noun like
        men into the accusative it cannot be seen whether this noun has been marked
        to show it is in the object relation. In fact there is no marking anywhere in the
        structure to show what is the object or where various constituent divisions can
        be made. The evidence previously given attempts to establish that these
        clauses function as a single unit. If this is not the case then what follows these

I
        verbs must be two divisions: one for the noun phrase which will function as the
I

object and a second division for what is left, a truncated subjectless clause.
This is the type of division that is made in Relational Grammar, for verbs like
want or expect, where only part of the embedded clause assumes the function
of direct object and the rest takes the relation of chdmeur 'unemployed' (Blake:
1990:93ff). It is a 'raising analysis' where a constituent that belongs logically
to the complement clause is said to be raised to the object of the matrix clause.



This is a possible analysis since Abun clauses are unmarked to show any type
of constituent marking. However, this analysis is not preferred due to structural
grounds, which are assumed to reflect the grammatical structure of Abun more
accurately.


Firstly, with both predicate types involved the entire clause which functions as
the object can be replaced by a single noun phrase which can function as the
object. For example:


(71) An       ki    do   an       kra   su   ji         safe-wo       ji
     3s       say   COMP 3s       marry with 1s         like.this-but 1s

     bari-wa                -
                            an   re
     ~ o ~ . w ~ ~ ~ - T R A3s
                             N S PERF
     'She said that she would marry me however I did not want her.'

(72) Kapre      an bari-wa            Rahel bi        si     wergat      an
     Although 3s n o t . w a n t - ~Rahel
                                       ~ ~ ~ ~ POSS father persuade 3s
     'Although she did not want (to come) Rahel's father persuaded her.'

It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object,
as in the above examples, then this would confirm the analysis that only a part
of the embedded clause functions as the direct object.             However these
sentences show that for Abun sentence structure only a single constituent
division follows the predicate. This single division consists of the direct object.
                                                             Abun complement clauses 108



    There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions following the
    predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
I   two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases-one a direct object
I
I
I   and the other a truncated clause, we are left with determining the constituent
I
I

    status of these truncated clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible
    to have reduced subordinate clauses which have no overt subject as in the
    following: "Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with the rest of his work."
    However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate clauses. If
    example (70) is considered again,



    (70) Men yo         nyu-wa        men mu           ki    suk-du        r-6    nde
         IP NEG         fear-TR~Ns I P         go      Say   NOM-Say       this   NEG
         'We are not afraid to go and tell this story.'

    what is the status of mu ki sukdu re? Subjectless constituents like this do not

    exist elsewhere in the language. There are occasions when a subject may be
    omitted. Sometimes in narratives where the subject is the same or a succession

    of events is given in quick succession the subject may be omitted.



    (73) Ye     gat0 jam nde            Yefun gum to         men    ki     subot bere

     (74) Pa        sap su            mbamyo           tjtj                ndo nde       syur sa
          child     strike with       axe NEG          get.away            good NEG      water dry

          rek       e        yo       titi             ndo nde             dipa          dipa

          LOC       place One         DET     just
          'The young man struck (it) with the axe, (it) couldn't not get away at all.
          The stream was dry, and (it was) shallow, (and it) could not get away at all,
          (it) was just struggling, struggling in one place.'

     In both these examples there are several clauses where the subject was
     omitted. In both cases the omitted subject was not in the immediate context of
     the clauses concerned. The omitted subject was given several clauses earlier.
     In example (73) the omitted subject 'people' was given only two clauses
     preceding. However, in example (74) the omitted subject is 'eel' and is given
     four clauses prior to the first which takes 'eel' as its subject. It can be seen that
     in Abun omitted subjects only occur in certain types of narrative, particularly
     where these subjects have several actions attributed to them.                          In these
     instances the subjects are omitted from either simple clauses or coordinate
     clauses. These clauses are not subjectless embedded clauses.


     On this basis it is concluded that a subjectless subordinate clause is not a valid
     clause type in Abun. A sentence having the constituent division SUBJECT + VERB
     + OBJECT is quite common in Abun.                  However, a sentence which has the
     constituent division

     SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT +        (VERB+ OBJECT)

     is not. In the above the embedded clause is subjectless.


     There are languages, such as English which allow fronting of subordinate
     clauses. Frequently, when a subordinate clause is fronted it consists of verb
     9
      An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.

and object only. However, in Abun it is not possible to front any subordinate or
                                                                                            C

According to his definition, Abun has only one complement type, not two, for all       I
                                                                                       :        I


Abun complement clauses are indicative clauses. However, I would like to            i


suggest that Abun      does    have two     complement types-      those   with
complementizers and those without (in this paper termed 'embedded'). The                        I




basis for these distinctions is not found within the complement clause itself.
This has been the basis on which Noonan and others have made their division
of complement types. This basis has come from the alteration in structure of the
                                                                                                 I

complex sentence of which the complement is a part.        External rather than
internal considerations have been the basis for the division of Abun complement
types.   In this way Abun is different in its complement structure to other
                                                                                   I

3.3 Additional possibilities

So far two types of complement have been described, those that use the
complementizer and those that do not. There are certain predicates which,
when they take a complement, they do so only by using the complementizer. I

would like to call this type of predicate Type 1. Then there are a small number
of predicates which, when they take a complement the complementizer is never
                                                                               Abun complement clauses 11 1



        used, so that the complement clause is an embedded object. I would like to call
        these type of predicate Type 2. Then there is another type of predicate Type 3,
        which is able to take complement clauses of both types i.e. with and without the
        complementizer. Table One lists these three predicate types.

        predicates


        Sentences which take predicates termed Type 1 have been previously analysed
        to have the following structure:



        SUBJECT + PREDICATE 1 + (OBJECT)         + (INDIRECT      OBJECT) + ( DO + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)


        This type of predicate can have a maximum valency of three, if the complement

        clause is considered in apposition to the direct object.


        Sentences which take predicates termed Type 2 have been analysed as follows:

Again if the complement clause is considered in apposition to the direct object
then like those of type 2 they have a valency of only two, but the sentence
contains an additional constituent. In the alternative structure the sentence is
identical to that for predicate Type 2.


Examples of predicates of this third type are given below showing both
possibilities, with and without the complementizer do.


     Manipulative predicates


There are two manipulative predicates which when they take a complement

clause may be with or without the complementizer. These are syogat 'order' and
syaugat 'command strongly'.


                                           *.
(75) An        syogat     ji    d~      11       so      nyom          wa    an
     3s        order       Is   COMP I s         buy     machete       for   3s
     'He told me to buy a machete for him.'


(76) An      syogat         pa     jogru          san
     3s      order          child take.off        clothes
     'He ordered the girl to take off (her) clothes.'
                                                      Abun complement clauses 113



Example (75) shows syogat 'orderitell' with the complement clause as an
appositional constituent within the sentence in addition to the direct object, the
pronounji '1s'. In (76),however, the entire embedded complement clause is the
object. In this case no complementizer is used since a complementizer is only
used when the complement clause is in apposition to the direct object. The
English translation of both (75) and (76) does not show these structural
differences as both complement clauses have been translated using infinitive
verb forms. A more structurally correct translation of (75) would be something
like 'He ordered me to do this: Buy a machete for me.'


Similar examples are given below for syaugat 'command'. Example (77)
appeared earlier as example (9).



             syaugat        men-ka-we do   men-ka-we ki    sukdu
             command        1p-CLASS-~WOCOMP
                                           1p-CLASS-twosay NOM-speak

                     nde
    this     again NEG
    'He commanded the two of us not to tell this story again.'


            syaugat      yen           ma but                 nin
            command      people        come capture           2~
     'I commanded you to be captured.'


     Utterance predicates


There is only one utterance predicate, kendo 'call' which exhibits these two
structural possibilities. Example (79) below earlier appeared as example (8).



(79) Yen     kendo          men do     men gwaf men           bi   suk e
                            1p  C ~ M P1p  bring l p          pass things and

     men     grem

     'They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).'

             kendo         Erensi       ma   dom
                                        come too
     'He -!led   Erensi to come too.'

     Pretence predirates


Another predicate that is similar is the pretence predicate kidar lie/trick/deceive'.
Example (81) appeared earlier as example (20).



                                    do   an      yewon
                                    COMP 3s      shaman



(82) Erensi kidar          pa      ne     mu
     Erensi deceive        child DET go
     'Erensi deceived the child into going (away).'

It appears that a only a small number of predicates may behave this way,

exhibiting two distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate
there appear to be certain restrictions which limit the number of predicates
capable of doing this.      One restriction limits predicates to those that are
transitive. Any intransitive verb can only occur with the complementizer present.
The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givon describes
the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and terms this 'referential

continuity' (1993: 15).     In describing co-reference limitations for English
complement clauses he notes that 'The subject of the complement of a modality
verb must be co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of
the complement of a manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of

the main verb (italics his).' (Givon 1993:16) In Abun w-reference restrictions

also apply but naturally are different for those which Givon has described for
English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and complement
constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituerit. In three of the above examples, (75), (77) and (79),
                                                            Abun complement clauses 115



the object of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement
clause. In all of these cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced
by a pronoun which agrees in number and person with the object of the matrix
clause. However, example (81) showing a pretence predicate varies in that the
subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of the main clause
predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all
cases where these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English where
only in manipulative predicates does the object of these predicates agree with
the subject of the complement, as shown in Table One, this restriction is shared
by other predicate types.'' Therefore it appears that if a particular predicate can
take complements both with and without a complementizer then co-reference
restrictions operate.


     Knowledge predicates


The predicate jam 'knowlheadundentand' also may be considered a type 3

predicate in that it may occur with or without a complementizer. However, this
verb is structurally different in that it does not have an object immediately
preceding the complement clause constituent as is the case with the other type
3 predicates .    If jam has the meaning 'know' it is more likely to use the
complementizer in conjunction with the complement clause.               If jam has the
meaning 'hear' it appears not to use the complementizer.                 The following
examples illustrate these possibilitios.



(83) Ji     jam kwe mbrur kwenat           kra       kagit os ma it
     1s      hear wood snap tree-leaves crackle from path DIR C O W L
     'I heard wood snapping and leaves crackling coming from the path.'
10
 In part~cularpredicates such as 'know', 'lie' and 'call' which Givon terms 'Perception-
Cognition-Utterance' predicates and which apparently for English 'no co-reference with any
argument in the main clause ' is required (Givon 1993:16).
                                                        Abun complement clauses 1 16



(84) An     jam an       baca huruf dik        huruf dik
     3s      know 3s     read letter one letter one
     She knew (how) to read one letter at a time.'


(85) Ji    jam       do        sangge nau            re      dom         suk-ibit
     Is     know COMP true               palm.\~inethis      also        NOM-bad
     ' know that it is true, this palm wine is also a bad thing.'
     1

The following example is interesting in that it contains both types of complement
clause within the one sentence. There is an embedded complement clause
which is the object of the predicate jam 'hear'. This embedded clause contains
yet another complement which in this case consists of the complementizer in

conjunction with a complement clause.
                                                                    I

     'I heard him calling out: "Friend! Friend! Run quickly!"


3.4 More on manipulative predicates

Earlier in Section 3.2 manipulative predicates which made use of the suffix -gat
were discussed. These predicates did not make use of the wmplementizer and
the complements were analysed as embedded objects.                      However, the
manipulative verb ben 'dolmake' was not discussed because it is considered to
be a predicate or a different type. Frequently ben has the meaning of 'do' and
so cannot be considered manipulative. But when ben has the meaning of 'make'
it can be used as a manipulative predicate.        With this verb, as with other
manipulative predicates, the complementizer is never used.              The following

examples are typical.
                                                      Abun complement clauses 117



(87) Nan     me su-ga             ben an       bi      pa i         ne
     2s      see thing-REL        make3s       pass child sick      DET
     'You see the thing that has made (my) child sick'

     3s     make motor that       sink   PERF
     'He made that motor sink.'

These complements have a similar structure to those that were termed
predicate type 2. In keeping with the structural analysis discussed earlier, here
also the entire complement clause is considered to be the object of the main
clause.


Since examples from all of the predicate types have been discussed fully, this
concludes the discussion of Abun complement clauses.

grammatical organization" (to use Givon's terminology). This type is known as
'clause chaining' (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause
chaining variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent
and coordinate constructions.            'The subordinatelcoordinate distinction is
irrelevant (in that there is no choice between the two) and both are absorbed
into the mediallfinal distinction.' (Longacre 1985:239) To illustrate this Longacre
gives two English sentences which illustrate the subordinatelcoordinate options
of a language such as English. These sentences, given below as (la) and (1b)

would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause chaining type.


(la) After chopping the wood, John camed it to his house.

(1b) John chopped the wood and camed it to his house.



Example (la) above consists of a subordinate temporal clause and an
independent clause. The first clause is marked as subordinate in English by
means of the participial verb form, the use of the conjunction 'after' and the
absence of the subject. Example (Ib) is given as an example of a 'coordinate
construction' (Longacre 1985239). Longacre's comment on these sentences,
quoted above, is to the effect that a clause chaining language does not permit
two different syntactic variants, as is possible in English. Only one is possible.

Abun is not a clause chaining language. However, the influence of Papuan
clause chaining languages can be seen when Longacre's examples are
translated into Abun.       The translations are given below as (2a) and (2b)
respectively. There is little syntactic difference between these two examples.




'11 Could be argued that strictly speaking the second clause of Longacre's example here cannot
stand on its own because the pronoun has been omitted. In the Abun translation given later,
this 1s certainly not the case as it is necessary to repeat the pronoun.

        Qesldes these temporal notions there is a particle in Abun which can behave similarly to a
        switch reference particle. The particle ga is used to identify the second actor or participant In a
        narfatlve Since Abun is not a clause chaining language ~t is not absolutely necessary to
        overtly mark the 'second actor'. It IS the author's opinion that thts IS a Papuan language feature         ,;
        which has influenced Abun grammar The particle ga is discussed further In K. Berry 1995
                                                          Abun Adverbial Clauses 122



neighbouring Papuan languages have had some influence on Abun sentence
structure. It is the author's opinion that just as clause chaining languages do not
have a clear cut subordinatelcoordinate distinction which is syntactically marked
in complex sentences, neither does the Abun language. This also is a Papuan
areal feature still evident in Abun even though Abun verb morphology has more
in common with Austronesian languages.         Therefore the adverbial clauses
discussed in this and the following chapter, can only be considered as 'adverbial'
subordinate clauses by semantic means; there is scarce syntactic marking to
indicate subordinate status.


Traditionally a discussion of the 'adverbial' subordinate clauses of a language
would subdivide clauses upon the basis of the semantic relationships expressed
between the clauses such as time, location, reason, condition etc.          In this
discussion I prefer to group clause types according to common syntactic
properties, as well as considering semantic similarities. In this and the following
chapter adverbial clauses are not grouped together as subordinate clauses
which contrast syntactically with coordinate clauses. Rather these clauses are
differentiated according to the type of conjunction that is used to link them. In
Abun conjunctions divide into two main types-postpositional and prepositional.

distinguisl es aspect and modality (his 'inner operators') from tense, status and
mood ('or ter operators').        Foley does not use the term 'mood' but instead
describes t as 'illocutionary force' (see Foley 1986:143ff). In Papuan languages
aspect ar 1 modality are usually indicated in some way on the verb stem, and
are part ( f the predicate. But tense and the other 'outer operators' tend to be
realised c. rammatically in different ways, on the sentence level. While Abun has
not beer classified as a Papuan language but is rather a West Papuan
language, nevertheless this generalisation made for Papuan languages appears
to have some significance. In Abun aspect and modality particles always are

part of a single clause. Status, that is the difference between realis and irrealis
time on1 occurs at the complex sentence level. In this way there appears to be
a distinction in that the concepts of 'realis' and 'irrealis' are not marked on the

individual clause in Abun as is commonly the case in many languages but are
marked on the sentence by means of a codjunction.


The usage of these two 'tensed' or temporal conjunctions in Abun sentences is

compared below.



4.2.1 The realis conjunction sa

When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within
clauses it may do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a
combination of both strategies. In regard to complex sentences tense as a

31t may appear confusing to use Foley's definition of the terms REALIS and IRREALIS since these
terms we often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example Givon 1984: 255). However,
Foley': term 'status' which he divides further into 'realis' and 'irrealis' closely approximates the
semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo.
                                                               Abun Adverbial Clauses 125



category may be marked within the component clauses and particular
conjunctions may convey particular 'marked' time meanings, such as 'before',
'after', 'as', 'while' etc.   The Abun conjunction sa carries the grammatical
information of 'realis', but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into
English as 'when.~~A~lS'.
                      Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time

setting. By usage of sa hearers know that the connected events expressed by
the clauses are in the past, have already occurred. When clauses are joined by
sa speakers usually pause after sa, indicating that sa is considered to be part of
the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a conjunction or means of joining
two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence with sa. Therefore
clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as the
English 'when' clause. Sa is a sentence medial subordinating conjunction and is
a constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following

structure:
                              [CLAUSE 1 +   sa] + CLAUSE 2


The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun.


(3)   Men kem mo kampung sa                   Rahel bi         ai  farkor an
      Ip   stay in village           when.^ Rachel poss father teach 3s
      'When we stayed in the village, Rachel's father taught her.'


( 4 ) Men     sem mone kret                  Marten          sa            Marten
      IP      sleep there wait.for           Marten          when. R       Marten

      ma      kam     Selasa
      come    day     Tuesday
      'We slept there, waiting for Marteii and he came on Tuesday.'

As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide.
Sa is a temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the
following range of meanings:
                                                          Abun Adverbial Clauses 126


              (1) precedence            'whenlbefore'
              (2) subsequence           'whenlafter'
              (3) simultaneity          'wheniwhile'
              (4) point coincidence     'whenlas1,just then'


Givon describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically 'less
marked'. Conjunctions such as 'before', 'after' 'while' etc are considered to
indicate 'specific temporal relations.' Therefore Givon considers that 'Such less-
marked coding strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the
temporal relation can be inferred from other features of the two clauses- most
commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.' (1990:828) Since in Abun the
conjunction itself indicates the 'tense' or time setting, it is not necessary to use
other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the
examples below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown
together with more specific means of indicating these.



      (1) Precedence 'whenlbefore'

(5)   Me-ka-we     gwat ma-kom      mo nu    sa     ge   gfl
      1p-CLASS-two bring come-reach to house when.R body three

      kwop          re
      die           PERF
      'When we carried (them) up to the house, three (fish) had already died.'
or    By the time we reached the house three had already died.'



(6)   Ji      ma   sa            an     yo       ma   nde      to
       IS     come when.^        3s     NEG      come NEG      INCOMPL
      'When I came he had not yet arrived.'
or    'By the time I came he had not yet amved.'
                                                                     Abun Adverbial Clauses 127



The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is
indicated by a specific time word meaning 'before'. Abun has no single word
which can be translated as 'before'. Instead the negative particle nde combined
with the incompletive aspect particle to are used to indicate 'not yet'. In the
above examples there are two additional means of inferring the time relation in
addition to the conjunction itself. Exar.iple (5) has the second clause marked by
the perfective aspect particle.' In example (6) the temporal precedence relation
is more explicitly marked by nde to 'not yetlbefore' again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general
subordinator sa. If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the
specific meaning of 'before'. For example,



(7) Tepsu gane ji                yo      fai  Apner nde            to              Apner dom
    just.like then 1s            NEG     know Apner NEG           INCOMPL          Apner also

      YO        fai  ji          nde
      NEG       know 1s          NEG


      'At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.'
or    'At that time I did not yet know Apner...       ..I




      (2) Subsequence 'whenlafter'

(8)   Men    ma   mo     kampung        sa           men                   nai     yor
      IP come to         village         when.^      1p                    take    spears
       'When we came to the village, we took the spears..'


(9)   Men    wat-bot            or     sa             an                   ki      do
       IP separate-along        finish when.^         3s                   say     COMP
      'When we had finished examining (her), he said......'
or    'After we had examined (her) he said... .'



'There is no need to mark the first clause for aspect since the meaning of sa is similar to that of
the perfective aspect particle re.
                                                                                        I
                                                           Abun Adverbial Clauses 128



In the above examples only one has any specific indications of the temporal
relations involved.   The word or has several meanings including 'finished',
'completely' and 'empty'. In example (9) or has the meaning that the action is
finished and within a complex sentence or can have the connective meaning of
'after' (as in example (2a) at the beginning of this chapter). It is not necessary to
use the general subordinator sa when the temporal relation of subsequence is
intended. For example,



(10) Yewon        ne   ben suk          ne      or     yen           ma
     shamans DET do           things DET        after people          come
     'After the shamans did those things, the people came.'


     (3) Simultaneity 'whenlwhile'

(11) An   kra     Lamber sa         an-we ku       pa     dik          sor    re
     3s   marry Lamber when.^ 3p-two get           child one           only    PERF
     'When she was married to Lamber, they only had one child.'

or   'While she was married to Lamber,.......'


(12) Men    gwa bei     mo    sa           yen ki       kabar ma     do
     IP pound sago exist when.R             peoplesay news come COMP
     'When we were pounding sago, people brought some news that ...'
or   'Aslwhile we were pounding sago.. . .'



(13) Ye     we ma      sa        Ye      we but         gre nak we
     person two come when.^ person two catch frog nak two
     'When the two were coming, they caught two 'nak' frogs.'
or   'As the two were coming (along) they caught two 'nak' frogs.'


The three examples above all show temporal simultaneity. As noted previously
in common with other Papuan languages temporal simultaneity is strongly
marked in Abun grammar. Besides the usage of the conjunction sa to indicate
simultaneity, a compound form, sare-sa, is used to emphasise a simultaneous
                                                                        Abun Adverbial Clauses 129



    relationship between clauses. The compound is created by the addition of the
    adverb safe 'like this.' The adverb safe is itself a compound consisting of the
    adverb sa 'like's and the determiner & 'this'. When safe is used immediately
    after a verb it can convey a continuous or repetitive meaning to the action of the
    verb. For example



    (14) Wermus        titi     safe    ma   ket      yam0 kampung       tore
         Werrnus       run.away kept.on DIR west LOC         village     here
         'Wermus kept on running away (or making his escape) westward, towards
         the village here.'

    Therefore on some occasions safe is joined to the conjunction sa to form saresa
    'as, while' a conjunction which more specifically indicates the simultaneous
    relationship between the clauses joined.



    (15) Ji        kani        ret                   nden saresa             ji       sokme
         1s        look.around random                land while               Is      see

          lsak     ram
          lsak     move
         'As I was looking about everywhere, I saw lsak (moving) in the distance.'

    For more exact simultaneity of the time relationship between two clauses Abun
    has another way of expressing this which is not by means of a conjunction.
    When the speaker intends to convey that the events of both clauses occurred at
    the same time then the clitic           -I   is added to both clauses.            For precise
    simultaneity sa is not used being too general in meaning6.




    'The adverb sa is homophonous with the conjunction sa. As an adverb it rarely appears as a
    free form. It is normally part of a compound such as sare 'like.this', sat0 'for example', sagana
    'usually' etc. However it does appear as a free form in the interrogative sa u? 'like how?/how?
    'The fact that Abun grammar can mark the temporal notion of simultaneity in three overt ways.
    by the conjunctions sa and saresa and by the clitic -i indicates the grammatical importance of
    this notion.

         'When I came, the house was empty, everyone had gone.'

    or   'By the time I came, the house was empty, everyone had gone.'



    (18) An ndo mo pilot          sa          yesan desa         su-gane       ma

         'When he was asking the pilot, just at that time the local area chief came.'

    Apart from the conjunction sa this temporal relationship can be indicated by the
    time word sugane 'at that timelthen'. Example (18) includes this.



         Sa-realis 'conditional'

    The conjunction sa is most commonly used as a general temporal subordinator
    as described above and as such would best be translated into English as 'when'.
    However, sa can also be extended in its meaning to include the semantic
    concept of condition and to also include subjunctive modality. Longacre, in
    describing clause chaining languages states that, 'Temporal relations appear to
    be central in these languages and are extended metaphorically in other
    directions.' (Longacre 1985: 265) Certainly in regard to the conjunction sa,
    which normally functions as a temporal subordinating conjunction, its usage can
    be extended to include the notion of condition. Abun has no single lexical item

    that could be translated 'if. There are a number of ways that the semantic
    concept of 'condition' is conveyed in Abun. One of them is by means of the
    conjunction sa used together with the time words behere 'laterlwilllfuture'.
I

/   When the second clause of the complex sentence containing sa is marked by
                                                                     Abun Adverbial Clauses 131   ?




    behere the sentence has the same meaning as a conditional sentence and can
    be translated as 'if...then'.       Also in some cases these sentences could be
    translated as in a way that could be considered as 'subjunctive'.7 Because sa is
    a conjunction which conveys time setting, or 'tense' these sentences, although
    referring to hypothetical events, must be marked as being in the past. It could
    be stated that a past tense or realis 'conditional' conjunction is a contradiction in
    terms. However, because Abun does not overtly mark the notion of conditional
    by means of a morpheme, other strategies are used to convey this notion. One
    means is by the combination sa + be which results in a conditional sentence in a
    past or realis time setting.

         killing each other, don't you think?'


    4.2.2 The irrealis conjunction yo

    In the previous section the conjunction sa was described as a temporal

    subordinating conjunction which could be rendered as 'when' in English. Sa was
    described as a 'realis' conjunction because its usage indicates a past time
I

1   setting for the clauses that it links. In the same way the conjunction yo is also a
I
/   temporal conjunction. It also may be rendered in English as 'when'. However,


    'The notions often termed 'subjunctive', such as 'would have'. 'should have' etc are more
    emphatically conveyed by the compound conjunction sane-sa 'had that been the case'. This
    conjunction is discussed in the following chapter, section 5.4.
                                                               Abun Adverbial Clauses 133



independent clauses, it is necessary to mark the second clause with the
temporal word be 'futurelwill'.


(23) Ji         ben     ji    bi   suk i           Be         a     ma kon
     Is         do      Is    POSS thing own       FUT        2s    come look.afler
        ji  e
         IS FQM
        'I do my own thing. Will you later come and look 'after me?'

For a complex sentence, however, the conjunction yo indicates the same
meaning. It is not possible for a single clause to be marked by yo, because yo
is a conjunction. Like sat yo goes with the first clause of the complex sentence
and not the second.

Examples (27) and (28) above show hypothetical situations which could happen
at any future undisclosed time. These hypothetical situations could aptly be
translated by 'whenever'. Thus yo, here translated as 'when' in English could
also be translated as 'if for these irrealis sentences. Givon notes that, 'In many
languages, irrealis conditionals are marked identically as irrealis when-clauses,
so that the slight difference between them is inferred from the context.'(l990:
830) This is the case for Abun. Examples (30) and (31) below are irrealis

conditional sentences and are marked by yo to express the conditional
relationship between the clauses.

     2s        happy when.lR~ l p           add Barbarina        with 2s      live
     'If you are happy (about it) we will (send) Barbarina to live with you.'

     bere      syogat
     FUT       order
     'But if the young men haven't seen anything, (then) they order...'

It was stated earlier that Abun has no single lexical item to represent a
conditional relationship between clauses. The tensed conjunctions sa and yo
can be used to express this relationship but often no conjunction will be used at
all. In the following example the first clause expresses a current state so that
the time setting is neither past or future. Here neither sa or yo have been used
to link the two clauses.        There is no linker at all.    The two clauses are
juxtaposed and the conditional relationship that is expressed is inferred by the
hearer from the known context.


                                ..          ..
(32) Nan       bambn           11    be    j~     ben    obat        mo         a

     die       ASST

     '(If) you are not going to have me [marry me], (then) I will kill you with
     sorcery, so there!'

The conjunction yo is also used to link other clauses that could be described as
'hypothetical alternatives.'    Abun has no single lexical item that represents
alternation such as English 'or'. In questions often bad0 'ALTERNATIVE
                                                                     QUESTION

                                                         Abun Adverbial Clauses 136



be used where the situation is not fully known and therefore hypothetical in
some way. In such instances yo is best translated as 'whether'.



(33) An       mewa         an     bi   "won             ndo yo               ibit

    'Whether he looks after his wife well or badly, we do not know.'


                                       ...
    (4) compulsory consequence 'if then (must)'

It has been shown that yo is used within sentences to express the future time

setting of those sentences, to express possible events or hypothetical ones and
also to express a conditional relationship between two clauses. It can also be
used to link clauses where the event expressed by the second clause is a
compulsory consequence of the event expressed by the first. These types of
sentences are always hypothetical in nature, yet the additional link of
consequence is contained within the meaning of the complex sentence. For
example:



(34) Ye-to           gwa   yewon           dabe yo,            Ye           ne

    with antique cloth.'

    off       just
    'Whatever you find there, you know you must just kill it.'
                                                        Abun Adverbial Clauses 137



4.2.3 Constituent status of sa and yo

When both of these 'tensed' conjunctions mark a sentence they modify the first
clause of the sentence only. Thus these sentences have the following structure

                         [CLAUSE 1 + s@~o]+ CLAUSE 2



Because a single clause cannot be modified by a grammatical category 'tense',
sa and yo are considered subordinating conjunctions. However these 'tensed'
conjunctions differ structurally to other Abun subordinating conjunctions in that
they are postpositional. The complementizer do precedes the complement.
Likewise compounding conjunctions such as we 'because' and wo 'but' precede
the clause. This is to be expected since Abun is a language with svo word
order and has prepositions. The 'tensed' or temporal conjunctions sa and yo
depart from the pattern that is else where found in the language. In fact in vo
word order languages generally 'the connecting morpheme appears clause
initially - in the following clause.' (Givon 1990:889) These conjunctions being
postpositional illustrate characteristics often found in ov languages. Because
these two conjunctions show a difference in syntactic behaviour to other Abun
conjunctions they are considered to be in a separate sub-class to the others.


The two final examples show clearly that while both conjunctions have several

meanings in Abun, the predominant meaning is to give a time setting to the
sentences concerned. The first clause of each sentence is almost identical to
the other except for the choice of conjunction. The meaning difference is that
the events expressed by sentence (36) had at that stage not yet taken place
(being in the middle of a narrative), whereas sentence (37) (given earlier as
example (20)) expresses events already concluded and is in fact a summary
statement at the end of the same narrative. Therefore it is by the means of two

subordinating conjunctions that hearers can identify the time settings of Abun
sentences.

5. Prepositional Conjunctions

5.0 Introduction

In the previous chapter adverbial subordinate clauses, which were linked to the
larger sentence by means of postpositional conjunctions, were described. In
Abun, clauses are linked to form complex sentences in one of two ways- by
means of postpositional conjunctions or by means of prepositional conjunctions.
Clause types in Abun can be classified according to which type of conjunction is
used, rather than a subordinate/coordinate distinction which depends upon
clause-internal syntactic differences. In this chapter, the usage of prepositional
conjunctions within sentences will be described.           There are three types of
prepositional conjunction. These three types are grouped together according to
their common syntactic properties. Table 1 below outlines these groups and
lists the common syntactic features that distinguish them from each other.
There are a small number of conjunctions which do not fit neatly into these three
groups. These 'exceptions' have not been included in Table 1 but are also
discussed in this chapter.

 1. Preposition conjunctions            are also members of the class of prepositions
    wa 'for'                            can embed single clauses within larger
      tepsu 'like' etc                  sentences
                                        do not compound with other conjunctions

 2. Compounding conjunctions            cannot be used to embed clauses but link two
      we 'because'                      or more independent clauses
      wo 'but'                          may compound with other conjunctions to
                                        extend their range of meaning
      te 'then'
--.   ..



 3. 'Negative' conjunctions             consist of the clause negator onde
      onde-wo 'but really'              are always in compound form together with
      onde-sa 'otherwise (would)'       other conjunctions or time words
                          etc
                                                    Abun prepositional conjunctions 140



5.1 The preposition as conjunction

Traditionally prepositions and conjunctions have been considered as two
separate word classes within a language. Recently Huddleston has proposed,
at least for English, that prepositions and subordinating conjunctions be
conflated into a single class (1984: 338). Some of the reasoning behind this that
is applicable to Abun as well as English is that a number of these words 'enter
into construction with either an NP or a clause.'(Huddleston 1984: 339) Abun
prepositions behave like conjunctions in that a large number of the class of
prepositions have the ability to link a clause to a larger construction. Where
they differ from the other conjunction groups listed in Table 1 is in their ability to
be embed clauses within        larger units.    It will be shown later that other
conjunctions in Abun (also prepositional) link independent clauses together.
These conjunctions have been described as compounding conjunctions from
their ability to create new forms and extend their range of meaning.


The following table lists those Abun prepositions that behave also as
conjunctions. For some, when they are used to link a clause rather than an NP
their original meaning is extended.

                       TABLE 2 PREPOSITION CONJUNCTIONS

                     as PREPOSITION               as CONJUNCTION
     wa              'for' BENEFACTIVE             'for/in order to' PURPOSE
     tepsu           'likelsame as'                'likelsame as'
     wade            'until'                       'until'
     kadit           'fromlrather than'           'fromlrather than'
     karowa          'close tolnear'              'close to'
     subot           'aboutlalong'                'about'
     SU              'with' INSTRUMENT            'with'

The majority of Abun prepositions may act as conjunctions.             However, the
general locative mo 'atlin' can only be used in association with the relative
                                                          Abun prepositional conjunctions 141



clause marker gato.'          Some of the prepositions such as subot 'along' kamwa
'close totnear' and su 'with' are not commonly used as conjunctions. Examples

of those that are more commonly used, both as prepositions and as
conjunctions are given below.


         'wa' 'fsrlin order to'

(1)      An      fro         nu      yo                  wa    men
         3s      prepare     house DET.INDEF             for   1P
         'She prepared a house for us.'


(2) Marta tot             su-gato          gum do    brer      gwat ma        wa      men
    Marta cut             thing-REL        name COMP brer      bring DIR      for     Ip

         git      sugit mo
         eat      food on

         'Marta cut some 'brer' (leaves) and brought them back for us to eat our
         food on.'

The clause that follows the preposition wa in example (2) above is considered
as a single constituent. As discussed in Chapter 3 earlier, there is no non-finite
form of the verb in Abun, thus men git sugit mo represents a single clause.



(3)      Yenggras       Cosmils brek kwem           su   mu         nden     mo tanjung
         mister         Cosmus turn canoe           head DIR        land     to point

        Kasuwari          wa       men     sem mone.
        Cassowary         for      Ip      sleep there

        'Mister Cosmus turned the head of the canoe towards the shore at
        Cassowary Point in order for us to sleep there.'

Since wa is a preposition, if a clause containing wa is negated the prepositional
phrase is included within the negation. For example,




1
    Examples of these are in Chapter 2, p20ff.
                                                         Abun prepositional conjunctions 142



    (4)   Yenggras       ~0     ki     nggon       YO             wa         ji  -
                                                                                 nde
          elders         NEG say       women       ~ ~ ~ . i n d efor
                                                                    f         IS NEG
          'The elders did not speak to any women for me (to marry).'

    Likewise if wa links a constituent that is as large as a clause, this clause is also
    included within the scope of the negation of the main clause verb. Example (5)
    below illustrates this.



    (5)   Men fi          ku     oto     wa     men     bes    men    bi   suk yo
          IP NEG          find   car     for    Ip      lift   1p     POSS thing NEG

          mo      -
                  nde
          exist   NEG
          'We did not find any cars to carry our load (for us) at all.'

    In sections 3.1.5 and 3.2.1.1 earlier it was shown how a clause can be
    considered as subordinate by the placement of the final negative particle nde. If
    a main clause is to be negated the negative particle nde only occurs after any
    subordinate clause which may be embedded within the larger sentence. Thus
    clauses joined by wa are embedded clauses within a larger sentence. So in
    example (5) above the preposition wa is used to link the clause men bes men bi
    suk 'we load our things' to a larger sentence. The placement of the negative

    particle nde as sentence final indicates that this clause is in fact embedded.


    The following example is even more complex. The verb of the main clause is
    negative, and as is the case with main clause verbs in Abun, the second
I


    negative particle cannot occur until after any embedded clauses which are
    governed by the main clause.         In this example there are three embedded
    clauses, one a relative clause and two that are embedded by means of wa,
    show~ngthat wa is also recursive in nature. To add to the complexity the main
    clause is also an interrogative.       Again, like the final negative particle the
    interrogative marker e occurs after the embedded clauses.

     In a language like English adverbial subordinate clauses can be distinguished
     from coordinate clauses in that the subordinate clause is not fixed in its position
     within the sentence. The subordinate clause may either be pre-posed, that is
                                                   Abun prepositional conjunctions 145



sentence initial, or post-posed, that is sentence final. Such flexibility of sentence
position is not possible in Abun. Therefore in Abun, the ability to pre-pose or
post-pose an adverbial clause is not an indicator of subordination.           It has
already been discussed earlier (section 3.2.1.1) that there is no non- finite verb
form that can be used to signify that a clause is subordinate. Hou.:wer, the
placement of the final negative particle is an indicator in Abun that a ciause is
embedded within a larger sentence. By this means clauses that are linked to
larger clauses by means of prepositions are can be shown to be subordinate, as
in examples (5) and (6) above. However, prepositions and all conjunctions in
Abun are sentence medial. A clause together with its linking conjunction cannot
be fronted or pre-posed as is possible in a language like English. It has been
claimed that 'All languages seem to allow the pre-posing of ADV-clauses.'(Givon
1990:844) This is not the case for Abun and therefore this cannot be used as

an indicator of subordination.



5.2 Compounding conjunctions

The most striking feature of the second group of prepositional conjunctions is
indicated by their name- 'compounding' conjunctions. From three 'base' forms-
we 'because', wo 'but' and te 'then', a total of eight other compound conjunctions
are created. This feature, the ability to act as a base form within a compound, is

a significant syntactic feature which can be used to identify these three

conjunctions as a distinct group or sub-class in Abun.        Before the extent of
these compounding possibilities is discussed, another syntactic feature common
to these compounding conjunctions will be discussed first.



This second group of prepositional conjunctions, unlike those which are
prepositions, does not have the ability to embed a clause within a larger unit.
These conjunctions link two independent clauses together to form sentences
                                                  Abun prepositional conjunctions 146



which cannot be easily described by the traditional labels of subordinate or
coordinate.   In chapter four it was explained that Abun has little syntactic
evidence to support a subordinatelcoordinate division of complex sentences.
This is most likely due to the influence of Papuan clause-chaining languages
which also do not have this division. In fact many languages, not only Abim, 'do
not make a clear morpho-syntactic distinction between coordinate and
subordinate clauses.' (Givon 1990:848) At first glance sentences which contain
these conjunctions appear no different to those where a preposition is used as
the means of clause linkage. To show this several sentences are given below.
The first two, given earlier as examples (3) and (8) use the prepositions wa 'for'
and tepsu 'likelsame as'. Examples (18 ) . (19) and (20) show we 'because', wo
'but' and te 'then' respectively.

     'Yan Sundoi has already died but Edia Yesa is still living.'

     'I came and put on clothes then I went.'

In all of the above cases none of the clauses preceded by prepositional
conjunctions can be pre-posed, as this is not possible in Abun. In all of the
sentences above there are no special verb forms used, as the form of the verb
in Abun is invariant. Therefore it could be said that the constituent structure of
these sentences is identical. However, this is not the case.


In the previous section it was shown that the placement of the final negative
particle nde could be used to show that clauses which were linked by means of
prepositions such as wa were subordinate.                 In example (6) earlier the final
interrogative particle e also indicated that several clauses linked to the main
clause by the preposition wa were subordinate. In Abun the mood particle is
always the final constituent of the ~ l a u s e . ~If this same indicator of
subordination is applied to clauses that are linked by 'compounding' conjunctions
what is the outcome? Can clauses linked by compounding conjunctions be
shown to be embedded just as those linked by prepositions are? When this test
of subordination is applied it can be seen that sentences which use

compounding conjunctions are in fact different to those which make use of a
prepositions.     Example (5) is repeated below as example (21) to show this
contrast.



(21) Men                ku       oto     wa      men      bes     men      bi   suk yo
     IP NEG             find     car     for     1p       lift    1p       POSS thing NEG

     mo
     exist      NEG

      'We did not find any cars to carry our load (for us) at all.'


2 ~ h i sis discussed more fully in the paper by K. Beny 1995, Chapter 6
                                                         Abun prepositional conjunctions 148



In (21) above the main clause verb ku 'get' is negated and the final negative
particle nde occurs after the embedded clause which is linked by the preposition
wa 'for'. In example (22) below the means of clause linkage is the compounding
conjunction we 'because'. The negative particles have been placed in exactly
the same way as in (21) above, yet this is an unacceptable sentence.



                      ma   we
                NEG come because        1s       POSS woman                    sick   NEG
      'I did not come because my wife was sick.'

Example (22) above is structurally incorrect because when clauses are linked by
a compounding conjunction such as we 'because', each clause must be

individually marked for negation if negation is relevant. In example (23) below,
only the verb of the first clause, ma 'come' is negated. The second negative
particle nde occurs before the conjunction we indicating that the second clause
is not a subordinate clause.




               NEG   com NEG because            1s             POSS woman             sick
     'I did not come because my wife was sick.'

When clauses are linked by compounding conjunctions they cannot be

embedded, as is the case when clauses ?.re linked by prepositions. In these
cases each clause must be marked for negation and for mood, if this is
applicable. Each clause could stand as an independent clause. Therefore the
sentence which uses a compounding conjunction as the means of clause
linkage is structurally different to those which use prepositions. The following

     'He does not think about (the things) he (does ) wrong but he goes (and)
     talks about (the things) other people (do) wrong.'

The third conjunction that is included in the group of compounding conjunctions
is the sequential conjunction te 'then'. Abun has no single conjunction which in

meaning is precisely equivalent to a coordinate conjunction such as the English
'and'. However, te and its dialect variant ge in compound form produce a
number of varying sequential conjunctions.                It has been observed that the
notions of temporal simultaneity and sequence 'are elaborated with considerable
range and variety in Papua New Guinea.' (Longacre 1985:267) The number of
sequential variants found in Abun is typical of a Papuan language and shows

pointed out at the beginning of Chapter 4 there is little syntactic marking to distinguish the two
types. Rather I have preferred to distinguish the other syntactic feature that these conjunctions
possess, namely the ability to compound and create new forms.
                                                                                                     I

    something of the influence of these languages on Abun syntax.                     It may be
    uncommon to group sequential conjunctions together with those meaning
    'because' and 'but'. However, there are no syntactic distinctions found in Abun
    complex sentences which correlate with the semantic differences of these
    conjunctions and which would justify a further subdivision. Another type of
    conjunction, that which means 'alternation', such as the English 'or', is also
    normally considered together with a conjunction of contrast such as wo 'but'.
    Abun has no single morpheme which is used to indicate a~ternation.~
                                                                     Therefore,
    for Abun, on the basis of common syntactic behaviour sequential conjunctions
    are included within the second group of prepositional conjunctions-the
    'compounding' conjunctions.          Examples of sentences containing te and its
    variant ge are given below.

    5.3 Compound conjunctions

    As stated earlier the most obvious way that this second group of prepositional
    conjunctions differ from prepositions is their ability to compound with other
    conjunctions.     By doing so the range of semantic possibilities is greatly

     This is a feature marked on each clause which may represent a choice to the hearer. In
    interrogatives bad0 is used. Otherwise the temporal subordinate conjunction yo is used, or the
    particle ka, a borrowed term from the unrelated Biak language.

         e         is su-bere 'so that1. In this word the preposition su 'with' compounds with the
    time word bere 'later' to form a conjunction. Most conjunctions do not compound with time
    words as is the case here, the only exception being onde-ber 'otherwise.wil1' which will be
    discussed later.                                                                                 I

     sarewo 'however'

The compound sarewo is made up of safe 'like.thisl and wo 'but'. In many
instances its meaning is interchangeable with wo 'but'. Often it is best translated
as 'however.' While wo is used to express a semantic relationship of contrast
between clauses sarewo is more likely to express the semantic relationship of
contra-expectation.

     'They performed healing rituals on her there; however, she did not get
     properly healed from her sickness.'

The conjunction wo is a constituent of one another compound, onde-wo 'but
really'. Since onde is a negative particle this conjunction will be discussed in the
final section of this chapter on negative conjunctions.



5.3.1 Sequential clauses

The compound sequential conjunctions are not only made up of the conjunction

te 'then' but are also made up of other morphemes. One of these is the adverb
                                                 Abun prepositional conjunctions 153



or 'afterlfinished'. The other morpheme, the additive conjunction e 'and', is the
closest to truly being a coordinate conjunction of any that are found in Abun.
Before giving examples of the compound conjvnctions derived from te, a brief
sample of Abun sequential clauses is given below showing the use of these
constituent morphemes which frequently feature in Abun sequential clauses.


Like Papuan languages Abun has a number of ways to mark temporal
simultaneity and also temporal sequence. In regard to sequence especially
there are quite a variety of options to express the relationship of temporal
succession between clauses. Often clauses that are sequential in nature do not
use any conjunctions at all. They are simply juxtaposed. For example



(34) Men gwa        bei     mone men git men ror    men si     ndar
     Ip    pound sago there 1p       eat I p scrape I p  with dogs
     'We pounded sago there, we ate, we scraped (the sago palms), we
     (hunted) with dogs...'

On some occasions sequential clauses are joined by e which could be said to

mean 'and'. However, it often acts more like a pause word and is never used to
join nouns in a coordinate phrase. In these phrases si 'with' is used so that a
coordinate phrase such as 'women and children' in Abun is nggon si pa. The
conjunction e is used when the speaker is listing items, or closely related
activities, hence it is described as an additive conjunction. When used to join
clauses it is usually used with only two clauses and in a longer group of
sequential clauses other sequential conjunctions may be used together with it or
none at all.
                                                     Abun prepositional conjunctions 154



(35) Men        gu     boge         e      men     gu     wo-nggwan e
     IP         kill   fish.generic and    Ip      kill   fish-nggwan and
     wo-kwai           e
     fish-eel          and
     'We killed fish of various sorts, we killed 'nggwan' fish, eels..'


(36) Mentiti                  Men sem e            men mu         sem kagit
     IP run.away              Ip  sleep and        Ip  go         sleep from

     suk-sara  ne
     No~-dance that
     'We ran off. We slept and we went and slept rather than (continuing on
     with) the dance.'


(37) Ji        sam mu ji            grem kop e          Wgwe         ne    er
     1s        carry DIR    Is      put fixed and garden             DET   clear
     'I carried (the wood) away, I left it somewhere and the garden was cleared.'

Also frequently used to join sequential clauses is o r e 'after-and' or more simply
translated as 'and'.    The addition of or 'finishlafter' indicates that the action
expressed by the previous clause is finished and so this adds to the sequential
nature of the sentence.



(38) Nggon we          si     A baidim     kwas ore       go    ore       tik
     women two         with   Abaidim      bum and        cutup and       pull

     on                ne
     intestines        DET
     'The two women and Abaidim burned off (the hairs of the skin) and they
     cut (the meat) up and they pulled out the intestines.'

Thus the morphemes e and or are joined with te/ge to create other sequential
conjunctions.
                                                   Abun prepositional conjunctions 155



     ete 'and then'

By far the most commonly used sequential conjunction in any narrative or

dialogue is e-te 'and then'.      It is more frequently used than both of its
constituents, e and te.



                                 wa    men ete                  men    ma
             send.message       for    Ip    and.then           Ip     came
     'He sent a message for us and then we came.'


             ben safe               ete           be      ms sa          u ne
             do     like.this       and.then      later family how which QM
     'You do (things) like this and then Row will it be for the family?'




     oretelorge 'after that then'

Yet another sequential conjunction is created by the addition of the adverb or
'afterlfinish' to the conjunction ete 'and then'. Orete and its dialect variant orge
differ little in meaning to ete. The addition of or emphasises that the action
expressed by the first clause of the sentence is finished before preceding on to
the action of the second clause.          The notion of immediate chronological
sequence is made more evident by usage of orete rather than ete. Like ete,
orete is frequently used.



                                    men    git   mone or-ete           men      mu




     'He cooked food, we ate there and then we went to Syurur.'


                    sem wade kam or-ete                Abaidim         sun
                    sleep until day after-then         Abaidim         get.up
     'Abaidim slept until it was day and then Abaidim got up.'
                                                   Abun prepositional conjunctions 156



(43) Ji      ma   or-e             ji    grem suk or-ge                ji      mu
     Is      come after-and         1s   put  things after-and          1s     go

     o       re
     again   PERF
     'I came and I stored the things and then I went off again.'

By the illustration of the above examples it can be seen that the Abun speaker
has a wide variety of options when wishing to link clauses that are sequential in
nature. As well as not using any conjunction at all the speaker may choose from
five different conjunctions in order to express the notion of temporal sequence.
Therefore in any sentence of a sequential nature it is possible to find more than
one sequential conjunction used.



(44) An   gwa      dmm     det   pu         or-ete     yenggras          Erensi
     3s   beat     drum    piece loud.noise after-then elder             Erensi

     gen     ete           Erensi        sun
     startle and.then      Erensi        get. up
     'She beat on the drum loudly and then old Erensi was startled and Erensi
     got up.'

     eteyoloreteyo 'and nextland so'

There are two more sequential con~ur~ctions
                                         in Abun, but tbese two have the
component of meaning of result or outcome added to that of temporal sequence.
The conjunctions ete and orete when expanded by the tensed conjunction yo
result in two new conjunctions meaning 'and so' where both the concepts of
sequence and logical result are combined in one form. In this case the addition
of yo does not indicate an irrealis or non-past time setting for the sentence as

when yo is normally used. The addition of yo creates a new conjunction which
differs in its range of meaning and usage to other sequential conjunctions. The
way in which the usage of oreteyo differs to that of orete and other sequential
conjunctions is shown by the examples below. Example (45) was earlier given
as example (41).
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 157



(45) An         kon su-git          men git       mone or-ete               men mu
     3s         w o k NOM-food      1p  eat       there after-then          lp  go
        mo      Syurur
        to      Syurur
        'He cooked food, we ate there and then we went to Syurur.'


(46) An       ben suk-ye          oreteyo      an      bi      pa  kwop
     3s       do     ~Oudifficultyand-so       3s      POSS child die
     'He stirred up problems and then as a result his child died.'

Example (45) describes a series of events which presumably were
accomplished in close chronological sequence. This is normally the case when
the conjunctions ete and orete are used. However, example (46) does not
describe events that occur in close chronological sequence. The time sequence
between the two clauses concerned is more indefinite. Rather it seems that the
second clause does not merely follow on chronologically after the first clause but
follows as a result of the first one. The event expressed by the second clause
arises from, or is due to the events of the first. Other examples below illustrate
this.

Examples (47) and (48) show that something more than sequence is involved.
In both of these examples there is some cause-effect relationship involving the
two events that are linked by ete-yo/or-ete-yo. The second event is regarded as
being the result or outcome of the first. Thus eteyo/oreteyo has been translated
as 'and so' or 'and then as a result' to indicate its difference to cther sequential
conjunctions.


Oreteyo can also be used to link together a series of clauses which represent a
list of steps or actions in a common process. In these cases, there is a common
semantic thread expressed by the sequence of clauses, which concerns the
completion of the process being described. To understand this better it can be
seen in example (45) given earlier that while there is a semantic thread between
the first two clauses, 'He cooked food, we ate there...', there is none between
these first two and the final clause, 'and then (orete) we went to Syurur.' The
event expressed by this final clause did not follow as a direct result of the events
of the other two clauses. A conjunction like orete does not create any logical

expectations. A clause such as 'and then we went to sleep' wuld have also
followed the first two. This is not the case when oreteyo is used as example
(49) shows below.



(49) Pa              go     Pa            k m ~         Pa             bok jamtu
     young.man       cut.up young.man     make.hole     young.man      insert vine

     mo      oreteyo        Pa         far       jamtu nggwa
     in      and. next      young. man tie        vine loop
     'The young men cut (it) up, they put holes (in it), they put vine through the
     holes and then they tied the vine into loops.'

Oreteyo is used to link the final clause in these sequences indicating that the
outcome of the process has been reached. Oreteyo precedes the clause that
expresses the end of a semantically related chain of events. In this way the
                                                   Abun prepositional conjunctions 159



behaviour of the conjunction oreteyo is not unlike that of the final verb of a chain

in clause chaining languages. In such languages the distinct markings that the
verb takes for tense and person etc indicate that the end of the chain has been
reached.    Likewise by the choice of the conjunction oreteyo speakers can
indicate that the end of certain sequences has been reached. Again there is
something more than chronological sequence involved. Examples (50) and (51)
show oreteyo used in this way.        Here it has been translated 'and.nextq to
distinguish this usage from that in the earlier examples.

     group of relatives over there and then they took (it all).'


5.3.2 Constituent status of compounding conjunctions.

The compounding conjunctions described here have been included with other
Abun conjunctions that are classed as prepositional. With these conjunctions,
however, it is not always easy to determine which clause they are considered to
be a constituent of. The situation is further complicated when a postpositional

conjunction such as yo is part of the compound conjunction. In regard to two of
the compounding conjunctions, we 'because' and wo 'but', there is plenty of

variation by speakers as to whether they pause before or after the conjunction.
However, it appears that the larger or more complex the conjunction is speakers
                                                  Abun prepositional conjunctions 160



are more likely to pause at the end of the first clause, placing this conjunction
with the second clause. If for some reason less than a complex sentence is
given, for instance as a shortened response in a dialogue, all of these
conjunctions occur before the single clause that is given and never occur clause
finally. Therefore sentences which contain compounding conjunctions have the
following structure:

                       CIAUSE 1 + [CONJUNCTION   + CLAUSE 21


All conjunctions in Abun are typically sentence medial. While many of the
clauses discussed here could be described as neither subordinate nor
coordinate the role of the conjunction in Abun is to delineate the semantic
relationship that exists between the linked clauses. Therefore if any constituent
of these clauses is absent, including the conjunction, it is no longer possible to
have a complex sentence expressing such semantic relationships as reason,
contrast etc. In this way then the conjoined clauses become interdependent.



5.4 Influence of the national language on Abun complex
    sentence structure.

Over recent years a growing number of Abun speakers have become bilingual
and speak the national language, Bahasa Indonesia. However, the number of
those who are reasonably fluent is still small. This means that the influence of
Bahasa Indonesia on Abun complex sentence structure is not yet great. Abun
complex sentences differ quite markedly from lndonesian complex sentences.
There are also several conjunctions in lndonesian which have no Abun
counterpart. The most common of these are kalau 'if, sebelum 'before' and atau
'or'. Some Abun speakers add these lndonesian words alongside the existing

Abun form.    As yet these are not used to replace the Abun forms which
represent these concepts.
                                                         Abun prepositional conjunctions 161



The lndonesian language has, in a small way, influenced the structure of the
Abun complex sentence. All Abun conjunctions are sentence medial so that
sentence structure is as follows (constituency aside):

                          CLAUSE 1 + CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2


However, there are lndonesian conjunctions which are sentence initial. These
sentences have the following structure:

                         CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 1 + CLAUSE 2


This pattern has influenced Abun sentence structure in two cases. The first is
with the concessive conjunction kap-re 'although'. The second is with the logical
conjunction sane 'so'.


      kap-re 'although'

Kap-re is actually a noun phrase meaning 'this (period of) time'.                 Kap 'time
(unspecified)' is an older word which is infrequently used. It sutvives as a
variant of 'when INTERROGATIVE', kap u? 'when?'. The other variant is kam u?
'day whichlwhen?'. Kapre has come to be used as a conjunction meaning
'althoughleven though.' Of the existing Abun conjunctions there is none that has
the equivalent meaning of 'a~though'.~lndonesian, however, is a language
which strongly marks the semantic notion of concession. There are a number of
forms which can be used including meskipun 'although', walaupun 'although' and
also sungguhpun and sekalipun. Therefore it appears that the Abun temporal
phrase kap-re has undergone a category change. In doing so, it fills a semantic
concept which is strongly marked in the national language, but was not explicitly
marked in Abun.


6
 The semantic notion of concession can be created in Abun by marking the first clause with the
factitive predicate marker da and linking the two clauses by means of sarewo 'however'. This
gives rise to a sentence with the meaning 'He actually da did X however sarewo Y.'
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 162



Not oniy has the influence of lndonesian created a conjunction out of a temporal
phrase, but also its use in Abun follows the lndonesian sentence pattern. Kapre
is a sentence initial rather than a sentence medial conjunction. As such it is the
only sentence initial conjunction in Abun. It has been suggested that bilinguals
'create patterns in one of their languages which are structurally parallel to those
found in the other.' (Thompson and Longacre 1985:205) This appears to be
confirmed by the usage of kapre, which is most common with bilingual speakers
who have been educated in Indonesian. The following examples show the
influence of the lndonesian sentence structure. The first is in Bahasa Indonesia,
the others are Abun examples.



(52) Walaupun      ia       sakit ia      pergi ke          kelas
     although      3s       ill    3s     go    to          class
     'Although he was ill he went to class.17


(53) Kapre          an     ben sane               men jimnotku             an      to
     although       3s     do      1ike.that      3s      love             3s      still
     'Although he does (things) like that we still love him.'


(54) Kapre       an ban-WE!             Rahel bi        ai     wergat      an
     although    3s not want-TRANS Rahel POSS father persuade              3s
     'Even though she did not want (to do it), Rahel's father persuaded her.'


     sane 'so'

The conjunction sane 'so' has also been influenced by the sentence structure of
the national language. Sa-ne is actually an adverbial meaning 'like-that' or 'in
that way'. It is used as an adverbial in example (50) above in the first clause- an
ben sane 'he did (things) like that.' Like kapre, sane has come to be used as a
conjunction. On many occasions sane may precede a single clause only. In
these cases as in the example below, it acts as an adverb.


7
This example is taken from Echols and Shadily (7975: 25)
                                                      Abun prepositional conjunctions 163



(55) Sane    an     i      dom
     SO      3s     sick also
     'So she was sick also'
or   'It was like this, she was sick as well.'


Frequently with this type of sentence sane does not have the connective
meaning of 'so', but rather sane is equivalent to a descriptive sentence such as
'It was like this..' or "It was this way..' Abun has neither a lexical equivalent to 'it'
or the copula 'be', therefore sane in clar~seinitial position can be adequately
translated in this manner.       The meaning of the adverbial sane has been
extended to include that of a logical link between clauses and even between
larger units such as paragraphs. The influence of Indonesian is such that sane
may be either a sentence initial or sentence medial conjunction. Examples (56)
and (57) below are from illiterate speakers. Here sane is a sentence medial
conjunction following the usual Abun pattern.



(56) Nin      mu     sino sane nin       mewa          Yu
     2~       go     all    SO    2p     1ook.after    REFLEX
     'You all go together so you can look after each other.'


(57) A        kaim yenggras          it             sane a         yo      da

     palm.wine        again NEG
     'You are an old man now, so you don't drink palm wine any more.'

Examples (58) and (59) are from speakers who have been educated in
Indonesian. In these examples sane is a sentence initial conjunction.

         kinds of things.'

         'SO we carried the canoe towards the sea (and) left it near the water's
         edge. '

    Unlike with kapre the influence of Indonesian is not so strong as to totally
    change sane from a sentence medial to sentence initial conjunction.
    Nevertheless it can be seen that sane does not behave like other prepositional
    conjunctions.


    The conjunction sane has several variants all of which illustrate that the
    influence of the lndonesian language is still only partial. Sane in common with
    the compounding conjunctions also has the ability to compound with other
    conjunctions, creating new forms. Sane-yo and sane-gehe are two variants
    which could both be translated as 'so then' or 'therefore'. Just as the distinction
    between yo and sa was primarily one of tense or time setting, this distinction is
    carried over to the conjunction sane by means of the compound forms. Thus
    sane-ge is 'therefore.R' and sane-yo 'therefore. IRR'.


         sane-ge there fore.^'

    The compound sane-ge uses the conjunction ge 'then' to indicate realis or past
    time rather than the subordinating conjunction sa. There are dialect variants
    sane-te and sane-gede. Sane-ge differs from sane-yo only in the sense that

    sane-ge links two clauses that express events that have already occurred or are
    already past.

     'Later the yerom spirit would say that (the shaman) was the one who
     together with others killed his relative this (other) yerom, so the shaman
     went away (to avoid suspicion).'

In the above example the first clause represents not an actual event but only a
possibility. However, this possibility, what the yerom spirit might say, occurred
in the past according to the time setting of the narrative from which this
sentence was taken.        The last clause of the sentence is marked with the
perfective aspect re. By this it is known that the events described have already
taken place. Therefore these clauses are linked by sane-ge rather than sane-yo
to indicate a past time setting.


     sane-yo 'therefore.1~~'

When the temporal conjunction yo is joined to sane, creating sane-yo, then the
various ranges of meaning attributable to yo can be added as wall. In Chapter 4
it was stated that yo is used to indicate future events or plans, it can be used to
describe hypothetical events and it can be used to describe procedural,

     'Whenever women give birth (other) women must not touch her.'
or   'When a woman gives birth, if this is the case then (other) women must not
     touch her.'


     sane-sa 'had that been the case'

These two variants of the conjunction sane, described above, overtly mark the
time setting of the complex sentence by means of the additions of ge or yo.
Normally the conjunction ge does not indicate time setting but rather indicates
temporal sequence. It is used in this way because when the conjunction sa
combines with sane the meaning of the compound form is not that of time
setting. Sa has been described as a realis conjunction. This definition has been
taken to primarily mean that sa can be used to indicate events occurring in the
past. If events are marked for past time setting this is an indicator that these
events are factual. In Abun the conjunction sa has a secondary usage that is
derived from this 'factual' component of its meaning. This secondary usage can
best be described as 'subjunctive.'     The following examples illustrate this
secondary usage which is evident in the compound form sane-sa.



(68) A napawa    amam bi    suk-du    kamekre
     2s remember daddy POSS NOM-speak yesterday

     sane-sa                      kwis yo       gu     a       nde
     had.that.been.the.case       snake NEG     bite   2s      NEG
     'Had you remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake
     wouldn't have bitten you.'
or   'If you had remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake
     would not have bitten you.

The context for example (68) above is that a father has warned his son not to
play in long grass, because often snakes are found there. The son ignores the
warning and is bitten by the snake. The semantic thrust of sane-sa is to indicate
                                                   Abun prepositional fdnjunctions 168



that 'had the events of clause one been factual then the events of clause two
would not have happened.' Example (69) is similar:



(69) A       jam mo        ji      bi   suk-du    sane-sa
     2s       hear to       Is     poss NOM-speak had.that.been.the.case
     a      yo      ku     suk-ye       sare          nde
     2s      NEG get       ~o~-difficultlike.this     NEG
     'Had you listened to me, you would not have got into this trouble.'

or   'If you had listened to me you would not have got into this trouble.'

By comparing the usage of sane-sa with sane-yo it can be seen that sa and yo
demonstrate a perfectivelimperfective contrast. Sane-sa has the meaning 'had
that been the case', which is perfective or realis. On the other hand sane-yo
can mean 'that being the case' which is imperfective or irrealis. Example (70)
shows sane-yo used in this way.



(70) Men     i       saneyo               men mu        nai  pel       mo
     IP      sick    that. being.the.case Ip  go        take pills     at

     'If it is the case that we are sick, we go and get pills from the health
     worker.'
or   'Whenever we are sick, we go and get pills from the health worker

The last variant of sane is sane anato. This will be discussed in the following
section.



5.5 anato 'causative' conjunction

In the previous section two conjunctions were described which primarily filled
another category in Abun grammar besides that of 'conjunction'. Kap-re is a
temporal phrase meaning 'this time.' Sane is an adverbial meaning 'like that' or
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 169



'in that way.' For both these forms the influence of the national language has
affected the sentence structures in which they are used as conjunctions. There
is one other Abun word which is used as a conjunction, but this word is primarily
used as another part of speech. Unlike kapre and sene, this word, anato shows
no influence from Indonesian in the way that it is used. Anato is primarily a noun
modifier with the meaning of 'focus'. It is also used as a conjunction to link
clauses together. Therefore this word fills two categories in Abun grammar.
Anato does not fit into any other type of conjunction described so far, so it is
discussed separately to other conjunctions.


The word ana-to consists of two morphemes ana 'FOCUS' and to 'NMP'.'               Anato
frequently modifies a noun phrase to bring this noun phrase into focus, just like
a cleft construction does in languages that are capable of cleft constructions.
Since Abun does not possess a copula, the type of cleft construction found in
English is not possible. Neither are passive constructions possible in Abun.
However, the semantic possibilities engendered by both the passive and cleft
constructions are handled in Abun by means of de-focus and focus
respectively. A noun phrase may be brought into focus by means of anato. In
this way anato functions as a noun modifier, as shown in the examples below.


(71) Yewon        anato gu      suk ne        mon
     shamans      FOC kill     thing that aftewards
     'The shamans were the ones who killed the things afterwards.'

speakers are strongly emphasising that the event expressed in the first clause is
the reason for the event expressed in the second clause.

     her husband) killed his child.'


5.6 Negative conjunctions

The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde.
When a single clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles
which bracket the verb phrase. So clause negation has the structure

                       SUBJECT + YO + VERB PHRASE + nde


But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the
complex sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the
first clause can be negated by means of onde. Onde always occurs together
with some other conjunction. These create a group of conjunctions which are
termed 'negative' conjunctions. Sentences that use these negative conjunctions
have the following structure:

                   CLAUSE 1 + 0nde-CONJUNCTlON+ CLAUSE 2



Semantically this is most basically expressed as 'not clause one, clause two'. It
has been claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show
much influence from Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an
unrelated Papuan language, also has two distinct means of negation. One of
these 'ba ...negates the entire clause and roughly means 'it is not the case
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 173


that' ...it is the only element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final Barai.'
(Foiey and Van Valin 1984:192) The fact that this form has an equivalent
meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.

Table 4 lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.

                 onde-wo                'but really'

                 onde-sa                'otherwise.R (would)'

                 onde-yo                'otherwise.IRR (will)'

                 onde-bere              'otherwise.C~~T'

                 onde-ge                'otherwise-then'


     onde-wo 'but really'

The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the
contrastive conjunction onde-wo.        Any clauses linked by onde need to be
understood semantically in the following way:


CLAUSE 1                     onde-                          CLAUSE 2
event asserted               not the case, instead          reallalternative event


The event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as
negative within the clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde.
However, whatever was asserted by clause one is not the case, and so this
clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the event expressed by clause
two is in the speakers opinion the real situation. If the clause is linked by a
                                                 Abun prepositional conjunctions 174



negative con.iunction other than ondewo, the event expressed by clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo
links clauses expressing a false and true contrast. For example:



(77) Yenggras      njim do    re   ndar syut    nok      ondewo
     elders        think COMP here dogs bark.at wild-pig but.really

     ndar    syut         pa    kaiyi
     dogs    bark.at      child actual
     'The old men thought that the dogs were barking at a wild pig but actually
     the dogs were barking at a child.'


(78) An      ki     do   Sem ana         ben brek ne          ges    ondewo
     3s      say    COMP Sem FOC         make plate DET       fall   but.really

     an      dakai ben ges
     3s      self make fall
     'He said that Sem was the one who made the plate fall but really he himself
     caused (it) to fall.


     ondesa 'otherwise (would)'

Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time
conjunction sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is
counterfactual. Again the structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken
down semantically below to explain clearly the meaning of these types of
sentences.


ClAUSE I                  on&-sa                      CLAUSE 2

event asserted            (if) not so, instead        different outcome, past


The event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events
may or may not be true. The second clause describes a situation that would
arise in the event that clause one was negated. Onde represents the negation.
Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event and the outcome described.
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 175



    In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer to
    hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not
    the events in question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than
    in the future. In these sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner
    giving the meaning: "If the events expressed by clause one had not happened
    then the events expressed by clause two would have." Since Abun has no
?
    English equivalent to the conditional 'if this meaning is merely for the purposes
    of good translation. However 'Counter-fact propositions need not be associated
    with conditional ADV clauses.' (Givon 1990:831), as is the case here. That is to
    say, a wunterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt
    conditional means only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For
    example:



    (79) Su-gane men         ku      Ron onde-sa     men yo ku sugum
         with-that Ip        meet    Ron 0therwise.R 1p  NEG get money

         wa       men    ma   nde
         for      Ip     come NEG
         'At that time we met Ron, othewise we would not have had money to
         come (here).'

    or   'If, at that time, we hadn't met Ron we would not have had money to come
         here.'

    In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did
    actually occur-the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two
    expresses a hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not
    received the money-they would not have been able to pay for fares to return to
    their village. The usage of sa indicates to hearers that this speculation is about
    past events. Example (80) below is similar. It contains the variant onde-sor-sa.
    This adds a component of meaning similar to 'it was just as well that..'
                                                      Abun prepositional conjunctions 176



(80) Nu-won       ga mo Aiwam                 ndo ndo sat0          yewon
     house-shaman REL at Aiwom                good good for.example shamans

     gu       YU              to
     kill     REFLEX          still
     'It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was
     good in that the shamans didn't kill each other any more. But otherwise
     they would still be killing each other.'

or   'But if not they would still be killing each other.'

In the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these
clauses is that of its primary meaning -it is functioning as a tensed conjunction
indicating past time. The following two examples differ from (79) and (80) above
in that here sa is functioning according to its secondary usage-, it adds the
notion of 'subjunctive' to the first clause. Abun has no lexical equivalent to the
subjunctive 'should'. Therefore the translation of (81) below indicates this. In
these examples the hypothetical or non-factual event is in the first clause; the
factual event, describing what actually happened is in the second clause.

     'You should have all rowed that canoe, otherwise if one of you rows alone
     and then there is a really violent wind, then what will he do?.'

Example (81) above is a reprimand by an older woman to certain young people.
As such it could also be translated as 'Would that you had all rowed that canoe.'
This also is subjunctive. It expresses a wish or desire that past events could
                                                       Abun prepositional conjunctions 177



have occurred in a better way.g What actually happened was that one young
man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind. His comments are
given below as example (82). The variant onde-sor-sa here adds the meaning
'it would have been better...'



(82) Ware si          ji mbms kwem              onde-sor-sa      no-fuf sye         gwat
     Ware with         I s row canoe            otherwise-just-R wind big           caw
     ji        su      kwem
      Is       with    canoe
      'It would have been better if Ware had rowed the canoe with me, rather
      than me struggling against the wind in the canoe (by myself).'

or    'If Ware had rowed the canoe with me, the strong wind would not have
      battered me about in the canoe.'

Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as
the English 'if, it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that
hearers encode what is hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to
negate the contents of the preceding clause. On its own it does not attach truth
value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part of the conjunction onde-
wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of 'contrary to expectation.' When
part of the conjunctions onde-sa and on&-yo, onde is used to express the
notion of 'contrary to fact'.


      onde-yo 'otherwise (will)'

Onde-yo differs in meaning to onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In
clauses linked by onde-sa, the 'tensed' conjunction sa indicates to hearers that
the time setting of the sentence and its contents is in the past, events described
therein have already occurred. However, when the conjunction changes to yo


'~ust as Abun has no word for the modal 'should' neither does it have an equivalent to the
subjunctive verb 'wish'. The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for
expressing this notion.

     hearers understand that the event expressed by the second clause is non-past.
     These events have not actually occurred and may be hypothetical in nature
     also.

      or 'If you do not sweep up that mess down there, you will not get any more
         biscuits!'

     Givon makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals which
     are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions. "In addition to the
     subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend to be marked,
     cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically conflicting verbal
     inflections:

              (a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect and,

              (b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as:
                   future, subjunctive, conditional or a modal." (1990:83 1)

     According to Givon this 'semantic conflict' arises if a clause is marked with both
     a realis and irrealis 'operator' or one clause may be marked realis and the other
     irrealis. This situation may arise as given in example (84) below. The first
     clause is marked by the perfective aspect marker re. However, the usage of
     onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the conjunction yo on its
     own. If a sentence describes a predictive or procedural situation, then onde-yo
     is used.
                                                         Abun prepositional conjunctions 179



(84) Yen         gu     or         re   onde-yo                Ye     si      ma
     people      kill   completely PERF otherwise.IRR          people go.with come

      to       house side      people            give   ginger.root   lo
      'They would kill off (all those people). If this is not possible the (young)
      people with them (the older shamans) will come to the side of the house
      (and) give ginger root to (the people they want to kill).

Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English
'unless'. It is possible to give an alternative translation for example (84) above
as 'Unless you sweep up that mess down there, you won't get any biscuits!'
However, as seen in examples (77) and (78) above, which use onde-wo, onde
does not always have the meaning of a negative conditional. Wnen used as
part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast.                   Usage of onde
indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved.
This is achieved by negation of the content of the first clause.


      onde-bere ' o t h e w i s e . C ~ ~ ~ '

This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word bere
FUTURE/^^^^'. There are several variants of bere which need to be explained.
These three variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view
future time. These variants are:
                        ber    'soon, shortly'
                        bere 'later, definitely+ will'                                         I
                                                                                               I
                                                                                               I
                        be     'later, likely/probably+ could'

All these variants could be translated as 'later' or 'will' in regards to future time.

Ber is used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future.
However, with bere and be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified.
What is specified is the degree of certainty that the speaker attaches to the
future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels that the event          IS   a certainty
                                                               Abun prepositional conjunctions 180



L   then bere is used, meaning 'definitely will'.              If the speaker attaches less
    certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning 'probably
I

    will' or 'could1.   Both these time words can be joined to onde to create
    counterfactual conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past
    or future time in the same way as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-

I
    bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the speaker adds the semantic element of
    'degree of certainty' which is not present in the case of onde-yo. In regard to
    counterfactuals Givon notes that 'many languages allow further gradation, most
    particularly of eventslstates that are judged to be unlikely but not altogether
    impossible.' (1990:832) The gradations referred to here are from possibly true
    to not true. The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from
    probable to certain. Abun has no adverb or modal form which mearis 'definitely'
    or 'certainly'. Thus these concepts have been incorporated into these future
    time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bem and onde-he are given
    below.

                 events. It is not as frequently used as the other counterfactuals. The example
                 below has several variant translations since the negative contrast indicated by
        I        onde can be rendered in several ways in English.
