Summary

This thesis presents the first extensive description of the phonology,
morphology and basic syntax of the Abun language, which is spoken by
about 3,000 people in lrian Jaya, Indonesia.

After a discussion of Abun phonology, including syllable structure and tone,
an examination of Abun's morphology creates the basis for the organisation
of the rest of the thesis. Abun being an isolating language has very little
affixation. As a result of this there is a preponderance of closed word
classes. Furthermore, all the functions performed by affixation in synthetic
languages such as tense, aspect, mood and grammatical relations therefore
require the use of different strategies in Abun. Two basic strategies are
employed to perform these functions, namely, the use of word order and
particles.

The role of word order as the basis upon which grammatical relations are
indicated is discussed in chapters on clause and phrase structure.

The role of clause final particles which are used to indicate mood, aspect,
modality and negation are the focus of the final chapters of the thesis.

1. Introduction




             B*& people from Biak idand
    Abun is the name given to the language by the people themselves, a means
    'language', and bun means 'bush, jungle'. They call themselves the Yenden
    people, ye- ' person' and nden 'interior, land'. Sometimes they refer to the
    name of their language as Anden, but more commonly Abun. Rarely do they
    call themselves the Yembun people; rather they say that they, the Yenden
    people, speak the Abun language.


    The Abun language has been known by various names including Karon Pantai,
    Madik and Yimbun.     The name Karon Pantai, as it is listed in Voorhoeve
    (1975a:48), is the name given to the Abun speaking people by the Biak people.
    The Moi people to the west call them Madik, the meaning of which is uncertain.
I   Voorhoeve (1975a:48) listed the name Madik as a separate language for what
    has since been analysed as the Abun Ji dialect (Berry & Berry 1987). The
    Amberbaken to the east call them the Yimbun, or Yembun, a name which they
    obviously acquired from the Yenden themselves. This name is commonly used
    at the western end of the language group.


    The Biak name of Karon Pantai relates to the first contact between the two
    groups. The Biak people arrived from the island of Biak around the turn of the
    twentieth century and settled along the north coast of the Bird's Head of lrian
    Jaya, as in figure1 above. Their initial contact with the Abun speaking people
    was rather unusual. Some of the Biaks landed on the mainland and found
    several Abun speaking people who had feigned death and smeared maggots
    over their bodies. The Abun speaking people did this in the hope
1       Biaks would just ignore them and leave. But the Biaks soon discovered that
        they were still alive. As a result of this, they used the Biak term, Karon,
        meaning 'maggot eaten body' to describe the Abun speaking people. Later a
        further distinction was made between those who lived near the coast and those
        who lived on the Tamrau ranges, thus the addition of the Indonesian words
        pantai 'coast' and gunung 'mountain'.    So the Biak people called them the
        Karon Pantai people, and named their language Karon Pantai as well. The
        mountain group, which is a different language, they named Karon Gunung
        (listed as Karon Dori by Voorhoeve 1975:48).


    I
        Those in the closest major town, Sorong, use the Biak name Karon or Karon
    I
        Pantai to refer to this people.    Abun speaking people will often refer to
    I

        themselves as Karon people when talking to outsiders.          Even so, Abun
    1
        speaking people
                --      do not like the name Karon because of its negative
        connotations. And since the name, Abun, has now been introduced into the



                                                                                              I
        literature by Silzer & Clouse (1991) and Grimes (1992), this thesis will use
        Abun as the name for the language spoken by the Yenden people.

        1.5.1 Classification of the Abun language
                                                                                                    ,:
        The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206).                    r
                                                                                                    4
        It belongs to the small West Papuan Phylum. It is part of the Bird's Head

        Superstock, the Central Bird's Head Stock, and more specifically the North
                                                                                                    I


        Bird's Head Family, of which Abun and Madik are listed as members. While                    E


        Wurm listed Abun and Madik as separate languages, Berry & Berry (1987)
        have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and structural
        similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the same                I




        language. Therefore Abun is a family level isolate in the Central Bird's Head

I       Stock.                                                                                  41

Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based
mainly on its lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal
pronouns. There are a considerable number of Austronesian loanwords in the
West Papuan Phylum (WPP) languages, and when only non-Austronesian
lexical items are compared, the lexical interrelationship between the WPP
languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's Head contain a small
Trans-New Guinea Phylum lexical element, some of which may be due to
borrowing from the South Birds Head Stock (which is part of the TNG Phylum),
or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set Ill (Wurm
1982:40). Abun personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person
plural inclusive and exclusive, whereas this is universal for Austronesian
languages. Neither are there bound subject markers on the verb, which is a
feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun's pronouns are more akin to
Papuan languages rather than Austronesian languages.


However Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the
                                                                                       i

        1.5.2 The influence of surrounding languages on Abun
    I
    I   The influence of surrounding languages on Abun has been significant. It is
    1   particularly easy to see the influence of Biak and Indonesian, as will be
        demonstrated below, but less so the influence of the three neighbouring
        languages of Moi, Mpur and Mai Brat (Mare). This is no doubt because the
        contact with Biak and lndonesian has been closer and more continuous.


        There are two tribal groups that have migrated to the region where Abun is
        spoken, the As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated
        from Gag island before the turn of the century, came to live in the subdistrict of
        Mega where the Abun Ji dialect is spoken. The Biak people, who fled from the
        island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area in the early 1900s and have had a
        significant influence on the language of the Abun people. The Biak people
        brought the Christian message to the Abun people and in doing so used many
        of their own phrases and words. Words such as rur 'spirit', nadi 'pray', som
I
        'worship' were introduced from the Biak language. The word for 'God', Yefun
        has come from the Biak fun 'respected person' combined with the Abun
        personaliser prefix ye- 'person'. Also many words for fish and terms related to
        the sea and seaside have been assimilated from the Biak language.


        The Abun speaking people have not just had contact with the Biak people.
        Trade in kain timur '(antique) eastern cloth' with neighbouring language groups
        has had an influence on Abun. Kain timur is one of the Abun speaking people's             a




        main tokens of wealth and is used for paying bride price as well as fines. It
        originates from East Timor.




I       Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so, the
        lndonesian language has found its way to some extent even to the remotest
                                                                  Abun Introduction 7




Abun village. Many lndonesian words also accompanied the introduction of
Christianity and government systems, and have become part of Abun
vocabulary.     lndonesian words such as selamat 'save', ampuni 'forgive',
perintah 'command, rule', desa 'village' and berkat 'bless' have been introduced
although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning of some of these
lndonesian terms.


Several lndonesian and Biak verbs have been included in common use in Abun
even though in many cases there is an Abun lexical item for the same idea. A
bi- prefix, probably borrowed from the Biak language, is attached to verbs that
are introduced from other languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with
what could be named, the foreign verb verbaliser (w)prefix. Example (1)
shows the borrowing of the lndonesian word mengerti 'understand'; (2) uses the
Biak word win 'sail'.


(I)   lsak bi-mengerti       su-gato     nan       ki    ne.
      lsak W-understand NOM-which~ S             G say   DET
      'Isak understands what you are saying.'

(2)   Men bi-win mu               mo    ef
      ~ P L W-sail       go       LOC   island
      'Let's sail to the island.'

Abun speaking people have borrowed words to handle new concepts such as
sailing. In (2) the word is borrowed from Biak. The Abun people traditionally
lived on and around the Tambrau ranges and so did not have cause to sail
anywhere. Other verbs that have been introduced from lndonesian are tutup
'close', buka 'open' for closing and opening doors. Doors are also an new thing
for the Abun. In the past they just had a nu-syo 'house opening; doorway' (lit.
house-mouth) with no door as such.
                                                                   Abun Introduction 8




Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not retain the original
pronunciation. Abun does not have a separate velar nasal phoneme. The
velar nasal occurs only medially preceding a voiced velar plosive. So when
words are borrowed such as bunga 'flower', the ng (which represents a velar
nasal) is pronounced as a prenasalised plosive by Abun speakers. When a
velar nasal is word final in borrowed words such as kosong 'nil, empty, zero', it
is pronounced as an alveolar nasal, (koson).


Words borrowed from other languages are also changed in pronunciation not
just according to Abun phonology but also because the first ones who heard
the words that were borrowed did not recall and repeat the words accurately.
For example, the Biak word farkor 'study' was somehow changed to faskor by
the speakers of Abun Ji dialect whereas Abun Ye dialect speakers do not make




lndonesian conjunctions have also found their way into the Abun language.
The main conjunctions adopted from lndonesian are kalau 'if, when', sebelum
'before', baru 'then (in colloquial use)', jadi 'so, therefore'.      lndonesian
conjunctions are frequently used in addition to Abun conjunctions because the
placement of Abun conjunctions in the sentence often differs from the
lndonesian placement. In lndonesian the word sebelum 'before' is sentence
initial, whereas in Abun the expression nde fd 'before' occurs at the end of the
first sentence as in (3).


(3)   Men yo       mu nde         t6,       men git      sugif.
      IPL    NEG g0        NEG    INCOMPL   IPL eat      ~0~-eat
      'Before we go let's eat.'
        The Abun speaker who borrows the lndonesian sebelum 'before', also keeps
        his own language's expression for the same idea. So the use of the more
        redundant form as in (4) is common.

    I   (4)   Sebelum men yo              mu nde   tb,      men        git   suqit.
    I
    I         before    IPL     NEG       go NEG   INCOMPL I P L       eat   NOM-eat
    I
              'Before we go let's eat.'

        This is not just limited to conjunctions but also to other items such as the
        lndonesian prohibition jangan 'do not'. In Abun negation requires that yo and
        nde bracket the predicate as in (3). In the prohibitive form the yo is omitted.
        Example (5a) is the traditional way of saying 'Don't cry!', but Abun speakers
        who have been influenced by lndonesian add jangan. as in (5b). However (5c)
        is unacceptable.




                                                                                               I

    1   Abun speakers have borrowed some Indonesian words to make meanings




                                                                                           I
        more specific. The Abun word jam has the meaning of both 'to know' and 'to


I   I
        understand', as in (6) and (7). They have equated jam with the lndonesian
        word tahu 'to knod, but have borrowed the Indonesian mengerti 'to understand'
        in many cases to differentiate the two concepts, as in (7b).                           I
        (6)   Ji      jam an      gum.
              ISG      know 3 s ~ name
              'I know his name.'                                                          ..
                                                                   Abun IntroducWon 10



(7) a. Ji      jam         nan bi       sukdu.
         ~ S Gunderstand 2 s ~ poss words.
         'I understand what you are saying.'

     b. Ji     bi-mengerti       nan bi      sukdu.
         I S G FW-understand 2 s ~poss words.
         'I understand what you are saying.'

Some borrowed words undergo a shift in meaning from the original meaning in
the source language. For example, even though the Abun have a way to
express intensification, they have borrowed an lndonesian word, jadi 'to
happen, become' and mixed this with nde 'not' to make jadi nde 'INTENSIFIER'.
They actually have many ways of expressing intensification (see 5.5)'but they
have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the lndonesian is not
standard. The meaning of jadi nde according to its components is 'did not
happen'. But the meaning given to it is 'happened very much', as in (8).


             wo     jadi          nde.
     ~ S G cry      happen        NEG
     'He cried very much.'

There has been a significant amount of borrowing notably from the Biak and
lndonesian languages so much so that Abun speakers say that the 'original'
Abun is no longer spoken.



1.6 Abun and other West Papuan Phylum languages

The closest language lexically to the Abun language is Mai Brat (and in
particular, the Karon Dori dialect), which is also part of the Central Bird's Head
Stock, but is in a different family, the Central Bird's Head Family. Even then

the lexical relationship is rather low, somewhere in the order of 10 -15% are
cognate depending upon the dialects compared. (Berry & Berry 1987:30 show
figures of 6 - 8% cognate for a dialect of Mai Brat and each of the three main
Abun dialects. This is based on a word list of 200 words. However, when the
                                                                   Abun lntrodudon 11




Swadesh 100 list is used the percentages tend to be about 5% higher as
illustrated in Berry & Berry (198756).


The other West Papuan Phylum languages show a lexical similarity of between
3 and 6% (Berry 8( Berry 1987:30), or about 8    - 11% based on the 100 word
Swadesh list. According to the critical percentages used for classification of
languages based on lexicostatistical comparison in Voorhoeve (1975:16), these
other languages would be considered as part of a different stock to Abun. A
figure of 12% - 27% of shared cognates would result in the classification of the
languages as belonging to the same stock, but different families. So Abun and
Mai Brat belong to one stock, but they are in different families, on the basis of
lexical similarity. The other languages in the West Papuan Phylum in the Bird's
Head belong to other stocks.


Phonologically Abun and other WPP languages are very similar in terms of the
number and types of phonemes and syllable structure.          However, there are
several differences between Abun and the closest related language, Mai Brat.
Specifically, there is one additional consonant phoneme in Mai Brat lhl, and a
much wider variety of consonant clusters, including lsrl, lhrl lrknl, ImW, lmsyl,
Imfl which do not occur in Abun. Also in Abun tone is significant, but not in Mai
Brat. To the east, Mpur also has several contrastive tones.


Syntactically all WPP languages are similar. All have svo sentence structure.
Even so, there are differences between Abun and Mai Brat as revealed in
Brown (1991:43-61). Brown's paper on nominal phrases alone reveals that Mai
Brat has an obligatory subject person agreement prefix on verbs. According to
Wurm (1982:208), "An important structural and typological feature of the West
Papuan Phylum l~nguagesis the indication of both subject and object of the
verbs by prefixes, with a masculine-feminine gender distinction in the 3sg."
        This may be true of most other members of WPP, but for Abun there are no
        such prefixes on verbs and nor is there a masculine-feminine distinction. Abun




                                                                                           I
        stands in stark contrast to other WPP languages at this point.


        An examination of Brown's examples also reveals that in Mai Brat possessive
        phrases, where kinship relationships are involved, the possessor and the
        possessum are juxtaposed. However in Abun, a linker, bi is used. Thus there
        are some significant differences between Abun and the closest related WPP

        1.7 Abun dialects

        There are four distinct dialects of Abun. Each one is known by the word used
        for the first person singular pronoun in the dialect. The table below lists each

in their respective phonemic systems.

Each dialect is mutually intelligible, but the greater the distance from each
other the greater is the likelihood of lower intelligibility because the dialects are
in a chain from Abun Ji /I/ to Abun Ji Irl to Abun Ye to Abun Tat. Thus speakers
of Abun Tat frc    I.    Waibim find it difficult to understand everything that speakers
of Abun Ji /I/ from Mega say. Berry & Berry (1987:47) list the lexical similarity of
Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun Ye (Sausapor) as 86%, Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun
Ji 111 (Mega) as 82%, but Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun Ji 111 (Metnayam) as 74%.
The further away from each other, the lower is the lexical similarity. Abun Ye
speakers, being most central, understand the all other dialects best.                 The

majority of text analysed and discussed in this thesis is from Abun Ye and Abun
Ji /r/ dialects.
2. Phonology

2.1 Introduction

The sound system of Abun is relatively simple and consists of 20 consonants 5
simple vowels and seven diphthongs. Also there are three distinct tones,
highlrising, low and falling.



2.2 Consonants

The consonant phonemes of Abun are displayed in table 2.1 below.

2.2.1 Plosives

Plosives are differentiated by voicing and prenasalisation at four different
points of articulation. Plosives are distinguished from the other consonants in
                                                                               Abun phonology 16




                                                                                                   II
        However in the Indo-Pacific area only 28% of languages studied had affricates.
        Therefore, it is probable that Abun did not have affricates [tS], [j] and [nj] in the

    I   past, but that in recent years with the influence of the national language.

    I   Indonesian, these are becoming distinct phonemes. To date, only [j] and [nj]
                                                                                                   I
                                                                                                   I
        have achieved this.



                                                                               -
        Prenasalised plosives are analysed as units. They- could have been analysed
        as consonant clusters to make the phonemic inventory simpler, but this reason
        does not have a . place in linguistic analysis and description according to
        Herbert (1986:76). An attempt has been made to discover "what is, in some
        sense, psychologically 'real' for the native speaker," as Herbert puts it. There
        are several reasons that could be advanced to support the unit interpretation
        including timing considerations, irreversibility of the components and sonority
        hierachy considerations, but the most significant is syllable structure
        considerations, in particular an analysis of word initial consonant clusters. The
        only non-suspect word initial consonant clusters are pry br, fry kr and gr. No
        non-suspect examples of CCC clusters occur word initial.              Therefore, in
        examples such as mbre 'antique cloth', lmbl must be interpreted as a unit
        because no non-suspect CCC pattern exists. This is in accordance with Pike




                                                                                                   I
        sounds exert structural pressure on the phonemic interpretation of suspicious
        segments or suspicious sequences of segments" . Thus lmbl and the other




                                                                                                   I
        prenasalised plosives, have been interpreted as complex units.




I       The feature of prenasalised plosives is chiefly found in IndoPacific languages
        and the Nilo-Saharan languages according to Ruhlen (1976: 140). Ten percent
        of the 693 languages he studied have this feature, whereas in these two areas
                                                                                                   I
        36% of the languages studied had prenasalised plosives. Of the eight ways                  1
        that prenasalisation may interact with voicing, the most common systems are 'p
                                                                   Abunphondogy 17




mb'   and 'p b mb' accounting for 31 and 30 of the languages respectively. The
full system of 'p mp b mb' was only found in five languages and 'p mp b' in two.
Other possible systems such as 'mp b', Imp mb', 'p mp mb' and 'mp b mb' were
neither found nor expected. Abun fits the 'p b mb' system.


All plosives occur word initial and word medial, but not all occur word final.
Contrasts between voiced and the voiceless plosives are neutralised word final,
that is, voiceless plosive occur word final, but voiced and prenasalised plosives



Examples of plosives :




                                      'remember'
                                      'to arrest'




                                      'river mouth'

2.2.2 Fricatives

There are three voiceless fricatives in the Abun language, and no voiced ones.
Fricatives are distinguished from the other consonants in that they are
[+continuant, -sonorant]. All fricatives occur word initial, medial and final with
the exception of IS1 which neutralises to Is1 syllable finally.         They are
differentiated as follows:

                                    2.3- FRICATIVES

Examples of fricatives:

(I 3)   [frcm]        Ifreml              'landslide'
        [m3f~t]       Imofitl             'seven'

        [ScSar]       ISeSarl             'to go out'


2.2.3 Nasals

Nasals are distinguished from other consonants in that they are [-continuant,
+sonorant]. All nasals occur word initial, medial and final with the exception of
/fill which neutralises to In1word finally. The three nasals are differentiated by
the same features as fricatives, as seen in the table below:
                                                                           Abun phonology 19

                                                  'below'
                                                  'love'
                                                  'cloth'

    For example when the prefix suk- is added to a stem beginning with the velar
    stops, the lkl is elided. However when suk- is added to a stem beginning with
    labials lb p wl, the lkl is not elided. The glides are differentiated by the same
    features as for fricatives and nasals, as listed in the table below:                       ,

    Glides occur word initial, medial and final as in the examples below. There are
    no final consonant clusters.


                                              'this'

    Abun vowels tend to be more tense when in open syllables or when tone is
    high. For the high vowels, lil and lul, tensing is particularly noticeable in open
    syllables as seen in (16). For the mid vowels, /el and 101, tensing is more
    noticeable when tone is high, as in (17). Abun's one low vowel, la/, has no
    ~ e r c e ~ t i balloehonic

    There are also seven complex syllable peaks (diphthongs) in Abun - ail au, ei,
    eu, oil ou and ui. These could be interpreted as single units consisting of
    movement from lower to higher (ai, au, ei, eu, oi and ou) or back to front (ui).
    However they have been interpreted as VC clusters on the basis that they
    never occur before a consonant within a syllable. Indeed a unit interpretation is
    also viable based on non-suspect syllable patterns, but the absence of a CVC
    syllable, where the V is a dipthong, is significant.       Thus for this reason
    diphthongs, which are not very common in Abun, have been interpreted as
    sequences of VC clusters.
                                                                                            I

    2.4 Syllable structure

I   Although some linguists doubt the reality of the syllable as a phonologically
    definable linguistic unit (Herbert 1986:67), it is a useful aid in description. In

    Abun, syllable structure may be given simply as (C)(C)V(C). This assumes the
    definition of a syllable as a sequence of sounds containing one peak of
    prominence. The peak is represented by a vowel.


    The most common syllable is CV. Any consonant can occur in the syllable
    onset of this type of syllable. Also any of the five vowels can occur as the

    peak. The only restriction is that wu is unacceptable. All consonants may be
    absent, resulting in simple V syllables. Examples of these two syllable types
    are listed in (19).

The next most common syllable type is CVC. The onset can be any consonant
and the peak is any one of the five vowels.             The coda is limited to the
phonemes l p t k f s m n w r yl, that is, voiceless obstruents, nasals and glides.
The obstruent IU and the nasal Itilare neutralised to Is1 and In1 respectively in
the coda position.    The initial consonant may be absent, resulting in VC
syllables. Examples of these syllable types are listed in (20).

The least common syllable patterns are CCV and CCVC, where the first
element of the CC cluster consists of one of eight phonemes listed below in
                                                                   Abun phonology 24

the glide /y/ does not occur in this position (+ means occurs, - means does not

                                rn

The first consonant in these clusters is always [-coronal].      The [-coronal]
consonants Iml and l w l are not found in the non-suspect clusters with /r/, but
they are distinguished from the other [-coronal] consonants in that both lml and
Iwl are sonorant. Thus non-suspect CC clusters in Abun are in general made




               C    +      C



However when the second element is /w/, then the first consonant is usually




There is only one aberration to this, and that is the existence of imwl. There
are very few words beginning with Imwl. It it possible that these may have
been introduced from the Amberbaken language to the east. The word used

for 'many' in Abun Ji dialect is ok, while in Abun Tat it is mwa. The other /mw/
words also figure more prominently in the Abun Tat dialect which is at the
western extremity of the Abun language.

    Apart from consonant clusters commencing a syllable there are clusters across
    syllable boundaries. The first element must be one of the eight phonemes that
I
    are in the coda position of a syllable as listed vertically in table 2.10. The
    second component can be one of 20 phonemes as displayed horizontally in the
    table below.

    We can make the following observations from table 2.1 0:

    1.   Geminate clusters do not occur. Several other consonants are analogous
         to geminate clusters such as a voiceless plosive followed by a voiced
         plosive (!pbl, ltdl, ltjl, /kg), fricatives with other fricatives (Ifsl, IfSI, /sf/, 1~51)
I
         and the cluster /nfi/ does not occur.

    2.   Apart from geminate clusters, the l k l phoneme precedes all consonants
         word medially, with the exception that a word medial lkiil has not yet been
         found in the data to date. The only prefix in Abun ending with a consonant
         is suk-   'NOM'.   This may account for the fact that virtually all consonants
         follow Ikl.

    3.       Nasals before prenasalised plosives are usually assimilated to the point of
             articulation of the prenasalised plosive. Nasals do not always assimilate

             word medially to a following oral or nasal stop, such as in semda 'dream',
             benbot 'do according to', jamgwatu 'sweet potato', jamiii 'sweet potato
             (variety)'.

4.           Plosives, nasals and the glide l r l may all be followed by fricatives.

    5.       Nasals are not followed by irl.

6.           Only the I W phoneme precedes prenasalised plosives.

    7.       Both Is1 and in1 followed by l y l word medially become 151 and IN

             respectively.

    8.       There are many blank spaces left because Abun is basically a

             monosyllabic language, and although a particular combinat'[on does not
             occur in the data to date, the possibility is not ruled o

2.5.2 Nasal deletion

The nasal of a prenasalised stop is elided where prenasalised stops are
preceded by a nasal across word boundaries, according to the following rule.
                                                                        Abun phonology 28

                                                               I



       /an#mbad/      +     /an baO/       'he is well'


                                      are exceptions to the norm in that
                             ' men 'IPL'
The two pronouns, nan ' 2 s ~and
the final nasal is deleted at the word boundary when it is followed by a vowel, a
voiceless consonant or a nasal.




                       +    Ina iff        'get up'

       /nan#ma/        +    /na ma/        'come'



For these two pronouns only, a word final nasal assimilates to the point of
articulation of a following voiced stop across word boundaries as in the

2.5.3 r deletion

The alveolar glide lrl is deleted preceding morpheme boundaries. The only
instances observed involve the form /S&/ 'water' which forms compounds with
the names of rivers and creeks.


              r - 0 1 -     +
                                                 'Nju rivet'
                                                 'Yan river'




In Abun stress is predictable. Stress occurs on the last syllable of each word.
The following examples illustrate this. Stress is indicated by ' preceding the
stressed syllable.


                                'male'
                                'fish'
     /kw6 .'nQ/                 'tree sap'
                                'bad'
     /no.wa.'r&/                'lightening'
     /man.gor.'es/              'spinach'




Tone in Abun has a low functional load and may be disappearing as a useful
contrastive feature. There are three contrastive tones, highhising, low, and
falling. In this section high or rising tone is marked with an acute accent mark
above the vowel of the syllable, falling tone is marked with a grave accent, and
low tone is unmarked. Elsewhere in this thesis, tone is only marked where it is

germane to the discussion, as normally the context makes it clear to an Abun
speaker what tone is required. In (29a) bn has a falling tone, whereas in ( 2 9 ~ )
                                                                      Abunphonology 30




on has a low tone. In (2%) buk has a low tone, whereas in (29b) brSk has a



(29)   a. A n     dn          buk.
           ~ S G stomach tight
           'She is pregnant.'

       b. A n    dn        bdk.
           ~ S G stomach lump
           'He has a stomach lump.'

       c. A n    on         buk.
           ~ S G stools     tight
           'He needs to defecate.'

The three way distinction of tones can be seen in the following, but in (a) the
word sye is a verb, while in the other two examples it is an adjective. (Note: sy
is used here to represent the phoneme /y).


(30) a. SyrSr     sy&.
           water flow
           'The water flows.'

       b. Syur sy6.
          water flood
          'a big flood.'

       c. Syur sye.
          water big
          'a big river.'

Other sets where tone affects the lexical meaning of Abun words are i '(be) sick'
and I '(be) happy'; ndd 'good' and n& 'bitter'. There are very few minimal pairs
in the same word class, so the functional load borne by tone in Abun is very low.


Tone is also used in some instances to indicate plurality. The most common
use of tone here is to differ between the singular and plural forms of the third

Person pronoun, in which ' ~ P L 'is /An/ with a rising tone, while '3s~'
                                                                        is /en/ with
                                                                             Abun phonology 31




a low tone, as in (31). Other examples of where highlrising tone is used to
pluralise are seen in (32).


(31) /an bro sugif/           'he boils the food'
     /hn bro sugW             'they boil the food'




                                                     'taro tubers'


Tone sandhi also occurs in Abun. Ladefoged (1993:255,6) says, "Even in a
tone language the pitch of the voice changes continuously ... assimilations
occur between tones in much the same way as they do between segments.
When a high tone precedes a low tone, then the low tone will usually begin with
a downward pitch change. ... There seems to be a tendency in the languages of
the world for tone assimilations to be perseverative-the tone of one syllable
                                                                            II
hanging over into that of later syllables-rather     than anticipatory...


In Abun, where a highlrising tone precedes a low tone, the low tone begins with
a downward pitch, that is, it appears to be a falling tone. So, in (33a), when ma
is preceded by Bn it has a falling tone, but when it is preceded by an as in
(33b), ma has a level low tone.


(33) a. ~ r r ma      mo-re     re.
        ~ P L come    LOC-here PERF
         'They have come here.'

     b. An     ma     mo-re  re.
         ~ S G come LOC-here PERF
         'He has come here.'

When a low or falling tone precedes a high tone, the high tone begins with an
upward pitch, like a rising tone. The particle, it in (34a), although normally a
high tone, has a rising variant in this case due to the irlfluence of jam, which
has a falling tone. When jdm is replaced with gff, which has a high tone, as in
(34b), it also has a level high tone.


(34)   a. An     jrim     it.
          ~ S G know COMPL
          'He finally knows.'

       b. A n    git        it.
          ~ S G eat         COMPL
          'He finally ate.'


Note regarding the orthography of Abun as used elsewhere in this thesis:


The orthography used in the remainder of this thesis uses the phonemic
symbols presented in the consonant and vowel charts (Tables 2.1 and 2.7
above), with the exceptions that IS/ is written as sy, and I / is written as ny. Also
diphthongs such as /a~/,leu/, W and /ail, although interpreted earlier as VC, are
written as au, eu, oi and ai respectively.       This then reflects the practical
orthography used in Abun as a result of the influences of Indonesian
orthography.
                                                                lasses

    Traditionally major classes of words that are grammatically distinguished in a
    language have been called parts of speech.           In this chapter, after a brief
    discussion of morphological typology (3.1), we will explore the parts of speech
    distinctions that are significant for the Abun language (3.2),the components of
    each word class and their formation (3.3 and 3.4).


    Of particular interest is the analytical or isolating nature of the Abun language
    which therefore has very little affixation and as a result a prominent role for
    closed function word classes.


    In addition, many of the free forms in Abun are undergoing the process of
    grammaticalisation to become affixes, since they focus on grammatical function
    rather than lexical meaning. These free forms are handled together with the
    affixes in this description of Abun morphology.



    3.1 Typology

    The Abun language is best classified as an isolating or analytic language since it
    largely has a one to one correspondence between words and morphemes as is
    illustrated by the following sentence:


    (35)   Men ben suk mo nggwe yo,                   men ben suk sino.
            IPL    do thing LOC garden then IPL               do thing together
           'If we do things at the garden, then we do it together.'

    Furthermore,words in Abun are mostly monosyllabic. A sampling of the first 200
    words in each of five stories each by a five different speaken reveals that 80.8%
    of the words are monosyllabicl 17.8% have two syllables and oniy 1.4% have

I   three or more.
                                                                  Abun morphology and word classes 34




    1       In relation to morphological typology, Comrie (1989:46) discusses two indices,
            the index of synthesis and the index of fusion, the most significant for Abun

    1       being index of synthesis. This index has two extremes. At one extreme are
    i
            isolating languages, which have a one to one correspondence between

            morphemes and words.       At the other extreme are polysynthetic languages
            which have a high level of morpheme to word ratio.           Each language fits
            somewhere along this continuum. Abun is particularly noteworthy because it is
            very close to the isolating end of the spectrum. Examples of affixation and
            word compounding exist, but the vast majority of Abun words consist of only
            one morpheme. Analysis of the sample mentioned above reveals an average
            morpheme to word ratio of 1.13. This compares with English 1.68, Sanskrit
            2.59 and, at the other end of the scale, Eskimo, with 3.72 (Lyons 1968:188).


            The second index that Comrie discusses is the index of fusion which measures
            the extent to which morphemes within the word are readily segmentable, with
            the extremes being agglutination and fusion. The few affixes which occur in
            Abun are easily segmentable. There is some slight variability of morpheme
            shape predictable in terms of general phonological rules discussed in 2.5.
            Abun then, has an agglutinating morphology within its relatively small amount

f       I
            Comrie (1989:46ff) discusses several languages in relation to the index of
            fusion including Turkish, Hungarian and Russian.          Turkish is relatively

            agglutina!ing, Hungarian exhibits more fusion, and Russian even more fusion
                                                                                                        II
                                                           Abun morphology and word classes 35




     Therefore Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic and, in the few
     cases of affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are
     easily segmentable.


     The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are
     required to effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in
     many languages affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical
     relations.   However, in Abun, word order alone defines core grammatical
     relations, while prepositions are used with obliques. Number is expressed with
     a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix. Possession is not marked
     with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor and the
".




     Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs.        Instead of personlnumber
     agreement affixes on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other
     languages in the West Papuan Phylum have both free pronominal forms and
     personlnumber prefixes on verbs, includino the most closely related language,
     Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, .y.mporal prepositional phrases and
     some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by tense affixes.
     Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
     by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1986).


     The processes of word building in Abun are therefore rather limited. The
     following processes are evident:    limited suffixation on verbs (3.3.1); three

     prefixes for nouns (3.3.2); word compounding, principally in nouns (3.3.2) and
     some adjectives are used as manner adverbs (3.3.3 and 3.3.4).
    3.2 Establishing word classes

    In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be
    defined after a discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.


    In establishing the parts of speech classification for the Abun language

I   grammatical criteria have been employed, namely, the word's distribution, its
    range of syntactic functions and the morphological or syntactical categories for
    which it is specifiable. These criteria are listed by Schachter (1985:3)who states
    they are not open to the objections of unclear application that traditional
    definitions are.

I




    Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical
    criteria, they are then given e label that reflects their characteristics, so words
    that express actions, processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word
    class is decided upon after the word class has been established.


    Honey (1972:277) makes the point that "the object of the grammarian is to
    estaWish categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make
    the most comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical
    statements..."     Honey developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he
    established his system of word classes for Vietnamese (which is also an
    analyhcal language like Abun) on the basis of positional relationships of certain
    selected words anellor classes of words. Some of his methods have been
    applied to establish a set sf word classes far Abun.


    The wcrd classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes.
    Open classes of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that
    is in principle unlimited.    Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts.

verb adjuncts, conjunctions, proforrns, particles and interjections, have a fixed
and generally small number of words.



3.3 Open word classes

There are four open word classes discussed below, verbs (3.3.1), nouns (3.3.2),
adjectives (3.3.3) and adverbs (3.34, as shown in the table below.


                         TABLE3.1 - OPENWORDCLASSES

           Verbs               Intransitive
                               Transitive
                               Ditransitive

Accorditig to Schachter (1985:4) the distinction between nouns and vehs is one
of the few universal parts-of-speech distinctions. Regarding the distribution of
nouns in Abun, they may directly follow or precede the possessive linker bi but
never directly follow the predicate marker yo. Conversely verbs never directly
follow bi, but may directly follow yo.


Adjectives are distinguished from nouns and verbs in 3.3.3. Many adjectives do
double duty as adverbs and there are several other distinct adverb subclasses
discussed in 3.3.4.
3.3.1 Verbs

Verbs in Abun have three subclasses, transitive, intransitive and ditransitive.
These subclasses are distinguishable on the basis that intransitive verbs do not
occur with objects, transitive verbs do, whereas ditransitive verbs occur with an
object as well as an 'indirect object' in the form of a prepositional phrase. A
subclass of intransitive verbs can be transformed into transitive verbs by the
suffixation of -wa.


Suffixation on verbs is relatively limited in Abun. Four suffixes occur, three of
these resulting from grammaticalisation of prepositions, and the fourth from the
coalescence of an adverb. The following table lists verb suffixes.

                        TABLE3.2 - ABUNVERBSUFFIXES

                        Suffix       Meaning

                       I -wa     ( 'transitivelbenefactive' I
                                 1
                       pot-'extends scope'                 I
                        -ke!         various

                       I -gat I 'intensifier'              I
Three of the suffixes that occur with verbs come from the prepositions, wa
           bot 'PERLATIVE'
'BENEFACTIVE',          and ket 'along'. These three prepositions occur
in their free form, but also they have become attached to some verbs and
nouns with which they frequently co-occur.         For example, the benefactive
preposition has become affixed to some verbs to form verbs that have a
different meaning incorporating a benefactive notion. Likewise the other two
prepositions have also become affixed to some verbs. This procedure follows
the grammaticalisation principle of divergence proposed by Hopper (1991:22),
"when a lexical form undergoes: grammaticisation to a clitic or affix, the original
     ~ S G   prepare     house          a     BEN    IPL
     'He prepared a house for us.'

The suffix -wa has two basic uses in Abun. One transitivises intransitive verbs
and the other changes the meaning of transitive verbs to include a benefactive
notion.

           'Don't fear us anymore.'

                    kern.
           ISG      sit
           'I sit.'

    (40)   Noru ne        yen     ke-wa       Lamber nombrak.
           night DET ~INDEF sit-TRANS Lamber morning
           'That night they guarded Lamber's (body until) the morning.'

    The transitive verb syim-wa 'shut' can be derived by the suffixation of -wa to the
    noun syim 'hand' as in (41).


    (41)   lsak    syim-wa         nu-syo.
           lsak    ~ ~ C ~ - T R A house-mouth
                                   NS
           'Isak shut the door.'

    In addition to transitivising some intransitive verbs and nouns, the suffixation of
    -wa to transitive verbs changes the meaning to include a benefactive notion. In
    (42), the transitive verbs me 'see' and the preposition wa have combined
    together to form the inflected word, mewa 'take care of in (43).                    The

    benefactive notion combined with 'seeing' the canoe results in the idea of
i
I   'taking care of the canoe.
i
                                                         Abun morphology and word classes 41



(42)   Marinus        me kwem.
   a   Marinus        see canoe
       'Marinus saw the canoe.'

(43)   Mannus         me-wa         kwem.
       Marinus        take.care.of canoe
       'Marinus takes care of the canoe.'

Similarly the verb kon 'cook' and wa coalesces to result in a different meaning.
In (44) the transitive verb kon 'cook' is used in its normal sense, but if we
cooked food for lsak then the benefactive preposition would be a free form as
in (45).    However, to celebrate something, which comes from the idea of
cooking for something, results in the suffixation of -wa as in (46).


(44)   Men    kon sugit.
       1PL    cook NOM-&
       'We cooked food.'

(45)   Men    kon su-git          wa        Isak.
       IPL    cook ~ 0 ~ - e a t BEN        lsak
       'We cooked food for Isak.'

(46)   Men     kon-wa       nu    an.
       1PL     cook-BEN     house Sunday
       'We celebrated (the opening of) the church.'

Other verbs that change in their semantic scope as a result of the suffixation of
-wa are:

(47)         bi           'give'          biwa         'pay for'
             ki          'say'            kiwa         'ask for'
             napa        'recall'         napawa       'remember'

There are also a few verbs that no longer have an uninflected form such as
syaretwa 'to listen to'; rewa 'to deny'; sakanwa 'to meet at a nominated location
not at either person's home'; eswa 'to wait for'. The forms, syaret, re, sakan
and es no longer occur.

The grammaticalisation of bot

Bot, too, has undergone a process of grammaticalisation. The free form bot is
a PERLATIVE preposition, meaning 'along, about or through'. In (48) the normal
use of this preposition as 'about' is shown.


(48)   Pa          siker nok         bot     ha-yo-ha-yo
       young.man tease wild.pig PERL thing-a-thing-a
       'The young men teased the wild pig about many things.'

The form bot has in many cases become combined with verbs. The resultant
forms have a different semantic scope when compared to the uninflected forms,
for example, wat 'separate' and watbot 'examine' in (49) and (50).                    The
uninflected wat means 'separate', while watbot contains the perlative notion of
separating about or along a particular path, that is, examining.


(49)   Nggon we wat          nok     onyar       1,    be        onyar    i.
       women two separate wild.pig intestine own kangaroo intestines own
       'The two women separated the wild pig's intestines from the kangaroo's
       intestines.'

(50)   An      wat-bot            buku.
       ~ S G ~ e p a f a f e - ~ ~book.
                                   ~~
       'She studies the book.'

Some verbs that combine with bot and have meaning changes to include a
perlative notion are:


(51)        wat   separateldivide              wat-bot     examine
            jam   know, understand             jam-bot     believe
            tik   pull                         tik-bot     draw conclusions
            ki    say                          ki-bot      discuss
            nut   think                        nut-bot     think about
            mu    go                           mu-bot      go along
            is    go down                      is-bot      go down along
    The grammaticalisation of ket

    Ket also follows the same grammaticalisation procedure as bot and wa. The
    free form ket is a LOCATIVE preposition. It precedes the location of the path of
    the action. For example, the location where goods were being carried in (52) is
    along the ground, that is, by foot, and the location of the path of the cutting
    across in (53) was towards the interior (rather than the sea).
1


I
    (52)   Men     Sam suk ket bur.
           1PL    carry things LOC earth
           'We carried the things, walking along.

    (53)   Men     tot   ket nden.
           1PL     cut   LOC     interior
           'We cut across to !he interior (path).'

    Frequently, as stated above, objects are omitted in Abun resulting in the
    preposition ket being adjacent to a verb. This has resulted in the combining of
    some verbs with ket with a subsequent semantic shifl. The free form ket occurs
    adjacent to the verbs mu 'go', ti 'stand', tot 'cut', e 'fall over', but there is no
    evidence of semantic shift or change of prosody in these cases, so ket remains
    as a free form and is not affixed to these verbs. However, ket has become a
    suffix in the case of the two adjectives mbrin 'unconscious' (54) and ye 'difficult'

I   (55). This is clear because of both prosody and significant meaning changes in
I
I   these two examples. Another example of a change of meaning when -ket is

    suffixed is with the verb ki 'say'. The resultant word is ki-ket 'slander'.


    (54)   Ji      mbrin-ket               nan   gum re.

                                                            Abun morphology and word classes 44



The grammaticalisation of gat

The free form gat 'to spear, join' is a regular verb as in (56),and it arso behaves
as an adverb meaning that an action is done with intensity or penetratingly. In
(57) gat signifies that the act of entering new students of witchcraft into the
training house was not just at its old pace, but that now there was a new
emphasis on doing it, and that emphasis was more intense.


(56)   Musa gat nok.
       Musa spear wild.pig
       'Musa speared the wild pig.'

(57) An      sok     pa          ye-won              ne, i-be         gat.
       ~ S Genter young.men PERS-knowledge DET              its-new INTENSE
       'He is putting in young men (to train as) shamen, lots of new ones.'

Adverbs are post object in Abun clauses. Since objects are frequently elided,
the adverb often directly follows the verb, just like the prepositions wa, bot and
ket. Some verbs and nouns undergo prosody and semantic changes when
they co-occur with the adverb gat, and so they coalesce. In these cases, the
semantic changes are not always equal to the compositional meaning of the
components.      However the inflected verbs do have notions of intensity or
pressure. The conversion of status from a free form (the adverb) to an
inflection on the verb is clear due to prosody and semantic changes. In (58)
the verb wer 'to try (to seduce)' combines with -gat to form wer-gat 'make a
determined effort, work hard at'. Likewise the verb ki 'speak' combined with                 -
gat forms kigat 'speak persuasively'.        Furthermore the verb i '(be) sick'
combines to form i-gat '(be) frequently sick' (59).

(58)   An     wer-gat          an     baca.

       'Slhe pushed herself intensely to be able to read.

I        actually the verb, gat that is coalescing with another verb. Sentences like (60)
         show that indeed both the verb and adverb gat can occur in the one clause.
         The verb makes clear that they are spearing each other and the adverb
         conveying the manner in which they were doing it. In fact, ndi and gat in (60)


         there is certainly no change of compositional meaning compared to each verb's
         meaning when they occur in this way.            This is a case of serial verbs.   In
         contrast to \his when the adverb and a verb co-occur then coalescence occurs.
         So in (61) ndi-gat, the 3 a t refers to the intensity of fighting. Instead of an
         independent stress centre on each morpheme the primary stress is on gat,
         according to the stress patterns found in Abun words.


         (60) An     we ndi gat            yu           gat.

                'They (two) fought furiously.'

         A few nouns have also combined with -gat to form verbs, such as: syimgaf


    /                                                              toSorder'.
         'hand-INTENSE:to start' and syo-gat ' m o u t h - l N ~ ~ ~   ~:


         (62) Pilot      syim-ga t       kaparok uk            safu o.

                'The pilot started up the plane again.'

         (63) An        syo-gat                  pa    kern.
                ~ S G   mouth-INTENSE            child sit.
                'He ordered the child to sit.'


    1I   Some verbs no longer have the uninflected forms in the language. For

         example, the form syaugat 'to command' occurs, but syau does not.

3.3.2 Nouns

Within the noun class there are five distinct subclasses, proper nouns, common
nouns, compound nouns, body parts, and relator nouns, the last two of these
subclasses being closed ones. Proper nouns, which together with pronouns
always directly precede bi 'possessive linker', consist of words such as names of
people or places. They are distinguished from common nouns in that they never
occur after the possessive linker.        The subclass of body parts occur in
inalienable possessive constructions and are juxtaposed to the possessor, see
5.3 for more details.


Nouns are in general a single morpheme, but can also consist of multiple
morphemes. Multiple morphemes are derived from single morpheme nouns or
some other form classes through the processes of affixation and compounding.


There are three prefixes on nouns, a nominaliser, suk-, a personaliser, ye-, and
i-, a possessive pronoun prefix for non-human referents which replaces the
whole of a non-human whole-part relationship in compound nouns. They are
listed in the table below.

A subclass of verbs including activities such as eat, grow, plant, fight, decorate,
dance and any speaking type of verb such as say, advise, tell stories, sing or
chant can be prefixed with suk-. Adjectives can also be prefixed by suk-.
Intransitive motion verbs do not combine with this prefix. There is only one
example in the data of a noun, bo 'fruit' combining with suk-. The phonological
rule, that geminates do not occur in Abun, results in the ellipsis of k preceding
velar oral stops. In addition, the primary stress occurs on the final syllable and
so the prefix, suk- is unstressed. Some examples are below.

                             'to decorate'      suk-mbrau            'decoration'


          sara               'to dance'         suk-sa ra            'dance'



                                                                     'sickness'


                                                suk-ndo              'goodness'
                                                su-gum               'money'



                                                sukbo                'container'

The personaliser, ye-

Similar to suk, the free            lexical form, ye 'person' also undergoes
grammaticalisation to become a personaliser prefix, yet remains elsewhere as
an autonomous element. The free form occurs as an undefined or indefinite

third person pronoun (68). In such cases it has its own independent stress.

              mu        mo nden.
     ~INDEFg 0      LOC    outside
     They (indefinite) went outside.'
                                                                Abun morphology and word classes 49




        This independent stress is lost when the personaliser, ye- combines with nouns
    I

        to form names for persons in different roles or positions. The prefix is a
        derivational prefix and the resultant forms, which are in a different subclass, are
        frequently not equal to the compositional meaning of the components. In (69)
        the one who stands on a tree stump does so because he is a Isader in society.
        In (70) a man who has not been trained at one of the shaman training schools
        (where Abun men are trained to relate to spirit beings and so become 'priests'
        of their animistic religion) is considered to be not a 'normal' man but literally a
        woman-person.


        (69) ye-kwe-su

I       (70) ye-nggon
               PERS-woman
               'male who is not a shaman'

        Not all the affixed forms are idiomatic, but aspects of a particular person's
        origin or features are referred to, such as:


        (71) An         ye-nden.
               ~ S G PERS-in  land
               'He is a non-coastal (inland) person.'

        (72)   An      ye-ka-kwo.

               'He is a white person.'

        Use of the ye- prefix is also made in the Abun people's names. Almost all clan
        names, which are used like a family name, are formed by the prefixing of ye- to
        a verb or adjective, such as Ye-njau 'PERS-bite', Ye-bro 'PERS-boil', Yefin

        'PERS-pour1,Ye-nggren 'PERS-shine', Ye-kese 'PERS--evil1.
                                                            Abun morphology and wcud classes 50



    Noun compounds


    In addition to the stem modification processes such as those discussed above,
    a significant feature of Abun is word compounding. Words are formed by the
    combination of two or more members of open lexical classes such as kapar-ok
    'boat-fly: airplane', kwe-ngwot 'tree-packaged: book'. The components of these
    compounds are noun + verb and they form nouns. This may be expressed as
    [N-v]~,   in the same format Anderson (198546) uses. Other compounds, such
    as gwem-bo 'face-fruit: nose', nu-syo 'house-mouth: doorway' consist of noun +
    noun to form a noun and can be expressed as [ N - N ] ~


    The compound status of the examples given here is confirmed by the way the
    forms have shifted in meaning, which is more common for words than for
    phrases (Anderson 1985:43). So a yeqwes-wai 'PERS-leg-pass: leg passing
-   person' is actually a mediator, a kwe-ngwot 'tree-packaged: packaged tree' is a
    book and so on. But the main factor determining the compound status of the
    forms is the fact that stress in Abun is predictably syllable final, so the lack of
    stress on the initial syllables indicates that in the Abun mind a new word is
    derived. Thus in kapar-ok the final syllable, ok is stressed, v~hilethe syllables
    ka and par are not. If this was a clause, in the unusual event of a boat flying,
    then par of kapar would be stressed and the word ok would have its own
    independent stress.


    Some noun compounds consist of the personaliser and noun and verb, [N-V]N,

    or a noun and adjective [ N - ~ d j ] ~For
                                           . example, ye-gwes-wai 'PERS-legpass:
    mediator', ye-da-mok 'PERS-skin-raw: foreigner'       ye-pa-sye 'PERS-child-big:

    important person'.


    Nan-human 'whole-part' compounds are combinations of nouns where the
    second member is a bound morpheme. All of these may be represented as
                                                        Abun morphology and word classes 51




[N-N]~, since they are combinations of nouns, and the resultant form is also a

noun, eg. gur-bo 'coconut-fruit', su-go 'head-hair', be-ku 'kangaroo-flesh:
kangaroo meat'. In addition, bird names are compounds. The word ndam 'bird'
occurs in isolation, but the second morpheme (bird type) does not, for example,
ndam-kokor 'bird-fowl: domesticated fowl', nda-warn 'bird-crow: crow', nda-som
'bird-bat: fruit bat'. All of these types of compounds indicate a possessor-
possessed or whole-part relationship. For example, the generic word for tree is
kwe. But when leaves are referred to, the form is kwe-naf 'tree-leaves' The
first morpheme kwe, is a free form morpheme, but the latter morpheme -nat
'leaves' is bound. Leaves are never referred to as *nat. Likewise branch, bark,
roots are formed using kwe together with the respective bound morpheme,
kwe-guk 'branch', kwe-da 'bark' and kwe-nos 'roots'. The 'whole' in these types
of whole-part relationships is not just limited to kwe, but also other plants also
such as gur-nat 'coconut-l-.avesl, bei-nat 'sago palm-leaves'.           Furthermore
other living things such as birds, animals and fish and some inanimate objects
and their parts are also compounds. For example, ndam-go 'bird-feathers', wo-
dar 'fish-scales', yor-ot 'spear-tip'.   The morpheme representing the part is
always bound.

Noun compounds and the i- prefix

After the initial reference to a 'whole-part' type noun in a discourse, further
reference can be made to the item by replacing the morpheme representing the
whole with the prefix, i-.Therefore after an initial reference to kwenat,
additional reference to that item later in the discourse is made by using the
prefix I-as a pronominal referent and so the form would be i-nat 'its-leaves'.
Likewise with the other types of whole-part relationships, ndam-go becomes i-
go 'its-feathers', wo-cjar becomes i-dar 'its-scales' and yor-ot becomes i-ot 'its-
tip'. In such words both morphemes are bound.
                                                       Abun morphology and word classes 52




In human whole-part relationships or inalienable possession, the prefix i- is not
used, rather the person's name or person pronoun is used, for example, Musa
syim 'Musa's armlhand', ji syim 'my armlhand', an gwes 'hislher leg'.               The
possessive pronoun for human inalienable possession is the same as the
subject and object pronoun for each person. Furthermore the body part (syim,
'arm', gwes 'leg' etc.) may occur as a free form and is not a bound morpheme
as is the case of the 'part' in non-human whole-part relationships. Therefore the
prefix, C is only used as an inalienable possessive pronoun prefix for non-
human referents, replacing the 'whole' in the 'whole-part' relationship in the
same way a pronoun replaces a noun.

Relator nouns

The final noun subclass is relator nouns. These may appear in some cases as
the head or as a modifier in a locative prepositional phrase (see 5.4.2 for
examples). Words in this subclass can be broken into two subsubclasses,
those that stand on their own and those that compound with de 'side'. There
are nine in the former group and six in the latter. These are listed in the
following two tables.

                           &&n             'behind'
                           deruf           'at the back of
                           desnak          'underneath'
                           &n&n            'outside'

3.3.3 Adjectives

Adjectives are a class of words denoting qualities or attributes, which in Abun
functionally modify nouns, and frequently function as predicates (73a).
Adjectives are distinct from verbs in that they function as head of adjectival
phrases and in those phrases can speclfy degree such as comparative and
superlative (73b, c). Furthermore although structurally both adjectives and verbs
directly follow the predicate marker yo, verbs never directly precede the
intensifier wai, whereas adjectives do.


(73) a.    Yenggras           ne       nggi
          old/respected.man            strong
          'The old man is strong.'

                                 ne    nggi     wai       kadit nan.

          'The old man is stronger than you'

                                 ne  nggi wai       ore.
          oldlrespected.man DU       strong INTENSE complete
          'The old man is the strongest.'

The class of adjectives in Abun hovers on the borderline of being an open or
closed word class. While on the one hand adjectives do occur as predicates
and also specify degree,         features of an open class of adjectives,              many
adjectival meanings are expressed through verbs, which is more typical of a
                                                        Abun morphology and word classes 54




language with a closed adjective class according to Schachter (1985: 16).
Relativisation of verbs express the equivalent of a modifying adjective. For
example:


(74) Pa      gat0   jam suk       mwa ma.
       child REL     know things many come.
       'The boy who knows many things came. or The intelligent boy came.'

(75)   An      sok-bof      nu-sya       gat0 kak ne.
       3sG     enter-along house-mouthREL open DET
       'He entered though the open door.

Among the adjectives which modify the head of a noun phrase, syntactically
only one class can be distinguished because only one adjective can modify a
noun head in a noun phrase. The modification of a noun by more than one
adjeztive requires the use other constructions which are discussed in 5.2.1.


In the corpus of data to hand a total of 38 adjectives have been distinguished,
but there may well be others, thus it is included as an open word class.
Semantically distinctions can be made to form groups of colour, size, quality or
age adjectives, but syntactically they all function in the same way.


                                                                    wok-
There is one adjective compound formed by two adjectives, [ADJ-ADJ]~~~,
gan 'small-little: young and small'.


3.3.4 Adverbs

The class of adverbs, which function as modifiers of constituents oth,er than
nouns (Schachter 1985:20), is a heterogeneous group in Abun consisting of
several subclasses, 'directional' adverbs, 'time' adverbs, 'manner' adverbs and
'degree' adverbs. Directional and degree adverb subclasses are closed, and
the number of manner adverbs are limited. Time adverbs have more flexibility
with some compounding evident.
                                                            Abun morphologyand word classes 55




The directional adverbs subclass, which includes words such as nim
'east(erly)', ju 'upstream', act as adverbs when they occur outside the phrase,
that is, directly following a determiner as in (76b) and (77b).                This same
subclass of words (listed as relator nouns above) may also occur within the
phrase to modify the head of a locative prepositional phrase as seen in (76a)
and (77a). This subclass of relator nouns does 'double duty' acting both as
modifiers of a phrase, and as a closed subclass of directional adverbs in which
case they occur outside the phrase.


(76)   a. mo     banbo      sye nim ne
          LOC mountain big       east DET
          'on the big eastern mountain'

       b. mo     banbo     sye ne        nim.
          LOC mountain big         DET east
          'on the big mountain in the easterly direction'

(77)   a. mo     Nyanvon bi         nu     de-ju                     ne
          LOC    Nyarwon POSS house side-upstream                    DET
          'on the upstream side of Nyarwon's house'

       b. mo     Nyanvon bi         nu     ne        de-ju
          LOC    Nyarwon p o s s house DET           side-upstream
          'at Nyarwon's house, upstream side'

The second subclass of adverbs is time adverbs, which consists of words such
as ik 'tomorrow', kamekre 'yesterday', and compound constructions like kam-
dik-kam-dik 'day-one-day-one: everyday' and ber-gan 'later-little: shortly', are
usually sentence initial in their distribution, but may also be part of the
predicate. This subclass of adverbs alone has considerable options in its
placement in the sentence, for example,


(78)   a. Kam-dik-kam-dik an       ma     mo        ji bi      nu.
          day-one-day-one 3 s ~ come LOC               P o s s house
                                                     ISG
          'Everyday he came to my house.'

       b. An   kam-dik-kam-dik ma         mo       ji  bi   nu.
          ~ S Gday-one-day-one come LOC             ISGPOSS house
          'Everyday he came to my house.'
                                                        Abun morphology and word classes 56



       c. An      ma     kam-dik-kam-dik mo ji    bi   nu.
            ~ S G come day-one-day-one      LOC ISG
                                                  POSS house
            'He came everyday to my house.'

       d. An      ma     mo     ji     bi      nu    kam-dik-kam-dik.
            ~ S G come LOC       ISG   p o s s house day-one-day-one
            'He came to my house everyday.'

The third subclass of adverbs is manner adverbs. This subclass is not as
'open' as a regular open class because many adverbial meanings are
expressed in other ways, such as associative prepositional phrases su sangge
'with truth: truly', or the use of adjectives without any special markings, the
possibility of which Schachter (1985:22) mentions, where there are languages
in which the class of adjectives do double duty, modifying verbs as well as
nouns. Abun's adjectives do that type of double duty, for example, ndo in (79)
is a manner adverb, whereas ndo in (80) is an adjective. Alternatively one may
say that some adjectives undergo conversion to form a subclass of manner
adverbs.


(79)   An    ben an        bi     suk   i      ne      ndo.
       ~ S G do     ~ S G POSS thing    Own    DET     good
       'He does his things well.'

(80)   An    it    san    ndo     sepatu ndo.
       ~ S G wear clothes good shoes       good
       'He was wearing good clothes and good shoes.'

Manner adverbs consist of a small group of adjectives (about 12) that do
double duty as adjectives and manner adverbs such as ndo 'good/well', ibit
'badlbadly', nggi 'stronglstrongly', of 'sharplsharply'.      In addition there is
another group that only behave as adverbs such as kekro 'quickly', pare 'slowly'
                                                                  Abun morphology and word classes 57




    and a reduplicated form? nyip-nyap 'finely crushed'. All manner adverbs are
    distinguished distributionally in that they fall outside the noun phrase or
    possessive phrase, directly following the determiner as seen in (79).


    'Degree' adverbs are a small closed subclass of adverbs which modify manvier
    adverbs as well as adjectives. Distributionally they always directly follow an
    adjective or an adverb. There are two adverbs in this subclass, teker 'veryltoo'
    and wai 'more thanlpassing' as seen in (81) below and (82) above.

    (81)   An     nuk     ye       feker.
           ~ S G speak people INTENSE
           'She spoke (about) people too much.'

    (82)   An      bes an       nggwa kok          wai          ore.
           3 s ~lift      3 s ~body       high INTENSE          complete
           'He lifted up (exalted) himself as the highest.'


    3.4 Closed Word Classes

    In Abun there are six basic closed word classes consisting of noun adjuncts,
    verb adjuncts, conjunctions, proforms, particles and interjections.                  Each of
    these and their subclasses will be discussed in turn below.


    With regard to closed classes, Schachter (1985:23) makes the comment that
    there is a correlation between the prominence of closed classes in a language
    and the position of the language on the analytic-synthetic scale. The more
!
    analytic the language is, the more prominent is the role of closed classes.
    Schachter (198524) adds, "...much of the semantic and syntactic work done by
    the members of closed word classes in analytic languages is done instead by
    affixes in synthetic languages." Abun, being heavily analytic, therefore, has
    many distinct types of closed classes and very few affixes.


      Reduplicated forms occur in Abun but number less than ten. There are some verbs like rup-
    rek 'twinkle', and fot-fat 'break' and a noun, mok-muk 'body'.

                          Modal
 Interjections


The closed classes in Abun are distinguished on the basis of syntax, for
example, pronouns (together with proper nouns) may be directly followed by
the possessive linker bi, predicate markers always directly precede a verb or
predicate adjective, prepositions always precede their noun, and particles,
except the topicaliser, are always sentence final.

3.4.1 Noun adjuncts

There are several subclasses of noun adjuncts including the possessive linker
bi.    (for more detailed use of this linker see 5.3); ten prepositions; many
quantifiers (including general quantifiers, cardinal and ordinal numerals);
classifiers and determiners (which have three subsubclasses and many
compounds forms).


Below is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent.
More details of their use is found in 5.4.




      Preposition     English                      Preposition Type
      is/nai         'to'                          dative
      mo             'at/ to'                      spacio-temporal
      subotlbot      'aboutlalong'
      kagitlkadit    'from'
      karowa         'near'
      ket            'across1 at (non-locative)'
      wade/kom mo untillfor
      su             'with'                        associative, instrumental,
                                                   temporal
      wa             'for'                         benefactive/purposive      b




Quantifiers may be either general or a specific numeral.                The general
quantifiers are mwa 'many', bok 'several' and deyo 'some'.               They follow
adjectives, when present, in the noun phrase.


The Abun numeral system is a decimal system. This is common in the West
Papuan phylum to which Abun belongs, but the languages belonging to the
neighbouring Trans-Papuan phylum, some of which are in the south of the
Bird's Head peninsula of lrian Jaya, have a binary and additive system. The
table below lists the Abun numerals. Note that sop means 'andtin addition'.
The same word is also used in an syim-sop-kwa 'lit. his arm-addition-thing: his
finger'.

Ordinal numerals are formed by a combination of do and each numeral except
for do-ketke 'first', or the dialectal variant, do-futmo 'first'. Every other ordinal
numeral is formed by the combining of do and the appropriate cardinal
numeral. For example, do-mumek 'fifth', do-musyu dik sop we 'twelfth' and so
on.




 wotin is borrowed from the Biak language.
 rjbu is borrowed from Indonesian.

    When the quantifier is a specific numeral normally a classifier precedes it to
    indicate something of the shape and size of the object. There are many types
    of classifiers that may be used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase
    head. In Table 3.9 the common classifiers are listed with the types of nouns to
    which they apply.




    There are several subclasses of determiners including what may be called
    articles that deal with a specificlunspecific distinction, these are yo 'a' and ne
    'the'. A second subclass is the deictics which consist of re 'this', ne 'that' and tu
I
!   'that (distant)'. Thirdly there is a referents subclasses which consists of a
i
i   anaphoric referent, ga and a external referent to.          Also the three deictic
    particles and the subordinating conjunction to (a different to to the external
    referent) form compounds with the referents, as well as the focus, or
    topicaliser, particle, anal the simile particle, sa, and the general locative
    preposition mo, as shown in the table below:
                                                                Abun morpholosyand wwd classes 62

3.4.2 Verb adjuncts

There are two subclasses in the closed class of verb adjuncts. First there are
certain verbs that combine with verbal particles. These particles, such as ma




                                                                                                    I
'come', mu 'go' and kem 'stay' do double duty as verbs, but when used as
verbal particles are discontinuous with the verb and follow the object, see 5.1
for more details. Some of the verbal particles, like we 'away', are not used as
any other part of speech. Some verbs with verbal particles are listed in the
table below:                                                                                        1




A second subclass consists of four predicate marker particles which always

directly precede the verb when present.                The meanings of the predicate
markers range across the entire spectrum of concepts that are normally
Particle              Meaning                   Used in:

Abun has three subclasses of proforms including pronouns, prosentences,
interrogative proforms.


There is only one set of pronouns in Abun which are used for subject, object
and possessor listed in the table below. There is significant dialectal variation,
with the three main dialects being distinguished by their first person singular
pronoun. In addition to dual forms trial and greater are possible by the in
accordance with the noun phrase structure. Thus me-ka-gn 'we three' or an-ka-
at 'they four' are frequently used in story telling.
                                                                   Abun morphology and word classes 65

    In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun and two
    reflexive forms, dakai and wadigan which modify to the appropriate pronoun
    above (for further details regarding the distinction between these two see 5.2.1)
    and , yu. The same form of this pronoun is used for all persons.


I
    The Abun prosentence subclass consists of one member, which is also the
    primary negation particle, nde. This word is used to answer questions with a
    'no' and as such is equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use
    an echo system rather than a prosentence (see 6.1 for more details).


    There are three members of the interrogative proforms subclass, namely, u
    'which', suma 'what' and ot 'how many'. These forms combine with other words
    to form interrogative expressions such as, mo u 'LOC which: where', karn ot 'day
    how.many: when'. For more details see 6.4.



    3.4.5 Particles

    There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a
    particle used for negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles.
                                                            Abun morphology and word classes 66




    The term particle is used to mean a free form word that does not take any type
    of inflection. It is an invariant form that never occurs in an environment where it
    could be described as 'bound'.


    The topicaliser, or focus, particle is ana(to) which always occurs after the
    subject and before the verb. See 4.7.2 for more details about the use of this
    particle.


    There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before
    aspect mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in
    the negative.   To form the indicative negative this particle along with the
    predicate marker, yo, form a linked pair of particles. These particles jointly
I
    bracket the constituent "predicate". Used in a sentence without yo, nde makes
    the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see chapter 8.




    be in clause final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the
    verb, the object, the indirect object or an adjunct depending on the consttuents
    of the particular clause concerned. Also these particles are not clitics in that
    the particle takes equivalent phonological stress along with every other word in
    the clause.
                                                                    Abun morphdogy and word classes 67

There are a limited number of particles which some writers refer to as 'modality'
rather than as aspect (Foley 1986:152fT). In Abun three modal particles are
used which are listed in the table below and are discussed in more detail in 7.2.

In Abun the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed
through the means of a clause final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked.
One interesting feature of the mood particles is the use of two particles as a
linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a similar way, negation of indicative
sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the strategy of using two
particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating constituent
boundaries. Thus the constituent "interrogative" is marked by two particles,
one termed the initial question marker,       IQM,   occurring clause initially and the
other, the final question marker, FQM, which ends or closes the interrogative. In
modern usage the initial question marker fe appears to be optional, perhaps

influenced by the national language, Indonesian, which does not possess such
a particle. The FQM differs according to the type of interrogative.


A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about
mood particle listed here see chapter 6.

3.4.6 Interjections

There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! 'expression of
surpriselalarm' (for example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! 'expression of
disgust' (for example, when someone doubts the integrity of another person,
this interjection would begin a defense); bei! 'expression of surprise'.
According to Schachter (1985:58) "The class of interjections often includes
words which are phonologically distinctive." However, in contrast to this, those
interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the
language.
4. Clause structure

The focus of this chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly some
comments are made regarding the core grammar and grammatical relations
(4.1) followed by a note regarding how the grammatical relations hierarchy
relates to Abun (4.2).      A discussion of clause types (4.3), peripheral
constituents which are here labelled adjuncts (4.4), and clause final particles
(4.5), completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In section 4.6
Abun verbless clauses are discussed.


A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core,
but also in the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are
several syntactic information packaging options in Abun clauses such as a
passive-like constructions, topicalisation and cleft-like constructions which are
discussed in 4.7.



4.1 Core grammar and grammatical relations

The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum
languages, is SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.


Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews (1985:104) points out that in a great
many languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding
features of ordinary main clauses.      For example, in English, subjects are
primarily marked by the coding feature of preverbal position, and in some
limited cases indicated by case marking and cross-referencing. Abun subjects
are similar to English in that they are clearly encoded by word order. No case
marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather Abun subjects
                                                                   Abun clause structure 70




are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately
precedes the verb.


The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order
alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that
immediately follows the verb.


According to Andrews (1985:69) the first step in analysing the system of
grammatical relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is
transitive subject (prototypically an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent
or patient) and 0 is transitive object (prototypically a patient). Typologically
languages differ according to how these grammatical relations group.
Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.


On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the
S and A functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic-
coding being word order.     S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the
verb. In an intransitive clause, a subject (S) precedes the verb, as in (83). The
same is true for a transitive clause, the subject (A) precedes the verb and an
object (0)follows, as in (84).


(83)   Men       kas.
       1 PL      run
       SUBJECT VERB
       'We ran.'

(84)   Men        gwa Isak.
       1PL        hit lsak
       SUBJECT VERB OBJECT
       'We hit Isak.'
                                                                 Abun clause strudure 71




Morphologically the constituents of noun phrases are the same irrespective of
the grammatical role filled by the noun phrases. In (84) the subject of the
transitive clause (A) is first person plural, while an identical form is also the
object ( 0 ) of (85) and subject of the intransitive clause (S) in (83). All Abun
pronouns are invariant in form whether they refer to the subject, object or
possessor. See table 14 in 3.4.4. for a full list of pronouns.


(85)   lsak        gwa men.
       lsak        hit 1PL
       SUBJECT VERB OBJECT
       'Isak hit us.'

Most other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the
use of prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order
is still fairly rigid. For example, dative, where present, follows an object and
precedes other prepositional phrases. Locative phrases with the preposition
mo usually follow all other prepositional phrases.


Free form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free
from the otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that
they cannot occur preceding the direct object (see 4.4.1).


Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:

(ADJUNCTS) SUBJECT VERB (DIRECT OBJECT) (INDIRECT OBJECT) (ADJUNCTS)    [PARTICLES]

Adjunct means free form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various
prepositional phrases expressing, associative, instrumental, benefactive etc.
The subject is obligatory and is rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses.
Particles may optionally occur clause finally to indicate polarity, aspect,
modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the subject of the
last three chapters of this thesis.

i
i
    Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adjuncts expressing location or time
I   may also be fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see
I
I   4.7 below). Those expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those
    expressing location are only fronted on rare occasions.


    4.2 Abun and the grammatical relations hierarchy

    Blake (1990:l) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar
    and includes a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a
    hierarchy, namely subject, object, indirect object and obliques (that is,
    adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be distinctly marked, for example,
    the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be associated with the
    oblique end of the hierarchy.


    In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy it
    can be seen that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in table 1
    below. Firstly the subject is marked by word order, it is simply preverbal.
    Second, the object also is marked by word order, it is postverbal. Next, at the
    level of indirect object a change in marking takes place.       Higher in the
    hierarchy word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
    objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with
    word order taking a secondary role.
    Relation          Indication

    Subject           precedes verb

    0bject            follows verb, and intransitive verbs require class changing
                      suffix, -wa

    Indirect Object   follows object, and takes indirect object preposition idnai*

    Adjunct           occurs clause final following object or indirect object, and
                      takes appropriate preposition to indicate locative,
                      benefactive, instrument etc.

                                                                   Abun clause structure 74




subject person prefix on the verb, but Abun does not, necessitating the
continual use of the subject. So, for example, in (86) lsak is obligatory.

(86)   lsak      ma.
       lsak      came
       SUBJECT VERB
       'Isak came.'

Likewise the verb is obligatory. Any verb in isolation is ungrammatical. An
intransitive clause may consist of several verbs together as in (87). Serial
verbs like this function as a unit.


(87)   An        kas mu sem               mo   nden.
       ~ S G     run go         sleep     LOC  bush
       SUBJECT VERB                       LOCATIVEPHRASE
       'He ran and slept in the bush.'

Intransitive clauses may also contain prepositional phrases. These phrases
usually follow the verb as in (87), and will be discussed in greater detail below,
regarding position in 4.4.2, and regarding types in 5.3.


4.3.2 Transitive clauses

Transitive clauses contain verbs such as sap 'cut', git 'eat', gwa 'hit', and nai
'get'. The basic structure is SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT. Example (88) illustrates
a transitive clause.


(88)   Men        git      boge-ku.
       1PL        eat      fish-flesh
       SUBJECT VERB        OBJECT
       'We ate fish.'

The subject, as for intransitive clauses, is obligatory.       The object is also
notionally obligatory, however, object ellipsis frequently occurs in discourse. In
(89) there are two transitive clauses, the first contains sugit 'food' as the object.

However in the second clause the object is elided. The speaker could say an
1
I
?
     git sugif or, including the object, and still be acceptable grammatically. In all
I    cases where the object is elided it is recoverablefrom the context.
I




     (89)   An         gif       su-git.            An      git  or.
            ~ S G      eat       NOM-eat            ~ S G   eat  completely
            SUBJECT VERB         OBJECT             SUBJECT VERB
            'He ate the food.   He ate (it) all.'

     Transitive clauses may also include serial verbs depending upon speaker
     preference. A pronoun may be used to separate verbs such as in (go),
     whereas others run several verbs together, Ji mu git. 'I went and ate.' Three
     verbs have been observed together in the data, as seen in (91). Conceivably
     more than three could be acceptable given suitable semantic connections. In
     serial verb constructions like this, intransitive verbs precede transitive verbs.
     Where transitive verbs precede intransitive verbs an object intervenes.


     (go) Ji           mu       ji    git su-git                mo  nu.
1           1SG        go        1SG  eat NOM-eat               LOC house.
I.          SUBJECT VERB SUBJECT VERB OBJECT                    LOCPHRASE
i           'I went and ate at home.'

     (91) Ye-suk-mise      ma      nai       mat      an      mu           kef.
            PERS-NOM-evilcome capture carry           3 s ~ go             west
            SUBJECT        VERB                       OBJECT VBPCL         ADVERB
            'The police came and caught him and took him westward.'


     4.3.3 Ditransitive clauses

     Ditransitive clauses include verbs that require three arguments such as syo
     'give', kadum 'show', and bi 'send'. They are constructed in a similar way to
     transitive clauses but also include an obligatory dative prepositional phrase as
     the third argument. A ditransitive clause consists of:

             SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + DATIVE


     The dative argument here is obligatory. It is filled by a prepositional phrase
     that begins with the preposition is (Abun Ji) or, dialectal variant, nai (Abun
                                                                    Abun clause structure 76




Yenat) and it usually precedes other types of prepositional phrases, as seen in
(92) and (93).


(92)   Men      kadum      men bi         tiket     is   ye-suk-mise.
       IPL      show       IPL     POSS ticket      to   PERS-NOM-evil
       SUBJECT VERB        OBJECT                   DATIVE
       'We showed our tickets to the police.'

(93)   Nggon ne        syo     suk-ne      nai an      bi   im mo nu.
       girl     DEM give       NOM-DET     to 3SG POSS mother LOC house
       SUBJECT        VERB OBJECT DATIVE                       LOCATIVE
       'That girl gave those things to her mother at home.'

Frequently the object is omitted where it is understood from the context. In (94)
the object, 'three plates', is elided from the second clause. This is possible
because it is recoverable from the context that three plates were given to Isak.
In the same way the indirect object itself, when recoverable from the context
can be elided, except for the preposition. In (95) it is clear that the third person
singular referred to in the first clause is the recipient of the ginger.


(94)   An         nai brek gri,            an        SYO        is Isak.
       ~ S G      get plate three          ~ s G     give       to lsak
       SUBJECT VERB OBJECT                 SUBJECT VERB DATIVE
       'He took three plates (of food), he gave (them) to Isak.'

(95)   Ji    si an ma,             ji         bi     n          nai
       I S G with ~ S Gcome         1SG       give   ginger to
       SUBJECT         VERB         SUBJECTVERB OBJECT DATIVE
       'He and I came (to the house), and I gave the ginger to (him).'


4.4 Adjuncts

Adjuncts express spatio-temporal settings of events and other secondary
participants and information not contained in the core arguments. Adjuncts are
distinguished from the core arguments by syntactic positioning outside of the
core and by marking with prepositions. Adjuncts of a clause are therefore
typically filled by adverbial phrases (4.4.1) and prepositional phrases (4.4.2).
                                                                Abun clause structure 77




4.4.1 Adverbial phrases

Adverbial phrases consist of an adverb and an optional intensifier. In most
cases such phrases are realised by an adverb alone.


There are several types of adverbs discussed in 3.3.4 such as time adverbs,
manner adverbs, directional adverbs and degree adverbs. Degree adverbs are
used in forming adverbial and adjectival phrases and will be discussed later in
5.5. The other three types occur as free forms or as the head of an adverbial
phrase. There is some flexibility in their placement in the Abun sentence, but
as a general rule time adverbs are sentence initial while manner and directional
adverbs generally follow the object and precede prepositional phrases.


The most flexible as to their placement in an Abun sentence are time adverbs.
An example below repeated from 3.3.4 illustrates this. Usually time adverbs
are sentence initial, but to change the focus and semantic scope of the
predicate, they may follow the verb. This is particularly significant in negative
indicative sentences which are discussed in 8.5. Also time adverbs can occur
between a subject and verb on rare occasions, as in (96b), breaking the normal
pattern of Abun main clauses.

            SUBJECT   VERB   LOCATIVE PHRASE            ADVERB
            'He came to my house everyday.'

In Abun adverbs of manner there is some flexibility, but they generally follow
the object, where present. Therefore in intransitive clauses these adverbs
directly follow the verb (97a) or an another adjunct (97b), but are unacceptable
preverbal (97c) or following any polarity, aspect, modality or mood particle.


(97) a.     An         sem not           mo gum-wak        re.

             SUBJECT VERB ADVERB LOCATIVEPHRASE ASPECT
             'She has been sleeping quietly in the room.'

       b.   An        sem mo            gum-wak not         re.

       c.    *An      not      sem      mo gum-wak       re.

            SUBJECT ADVERBVERB LOCATIVEPHRASEASPECT
            'She has been sleeping quietly in the room.'

Usually an adverb indicating the manner of the action not only follows the
object but also precedes the dative as seen in (98a). It also may follow any
adjunct including the dative as in (98b), but it may not occur in any position
ahead of the object as in (98c) to (98e).

           'Quickly he gave food to me.'

Adverbs indicating direction also occur in the same position, that is, following
the object and preceding any prepositional phrase (99). These adverbs are
free form relator nouns (see 3.3.2) such as ti 'sea, north', bur 'earth, down', nim
'above, east', ket 'west', and nden 'interior, south'.

     SUBJECT VERB           OBJECT VBPCL ADVERB LOCATIVE
     'We turned around to go seaward at Sorong.'


4.4.2 Prepositional phrases

Prepositional phrases consist of dative, spacio-temporal, benefactive, manner,
associative, and instrumental phrases. Prepositional phrases follow an object.
When there is a dative prepositional phrase, it usually precedes other
prepositional phrases.      The order among the other types of phrases is
somewhat fluid.


The following examples illustrate the position of various types of phrases in the
clause. For more details regarding the types of prepositional phrases see 5.4.
Several types of phrases begin with a preposition su 'with', for example,
temporal phrases (1OO), associative phrases (101), instrumental phrases (102)
and (103) and manner phrases (104).
                                                                 Abun clause structure 80

(104)An         sok       mo Yefun bi      rus su sange.

     SUBJECT VERB LOCATIVE                     MANNER
     'He truly entered into God's family.'

Benefactive phrases begin with the preposition wa 'for' (105). Locative phrases
generally begin with the locative preposition mo 'at, in, on' (100) or can also
begin with ket 'along' (106), bot 'about' (107), or kadit 'from' (108).           The
preposition kadit is also used to form temparal phrases (109).


(105)An       so      semen      mo-re      wa an bi nu.

     just up to the east (of the village).'
                                                                  Abun clause structure 81

         SUBJECT VERB LOCATIVE                   VERB LOCATIVE
         'We went from Dom to Uigwern.'

         SUBJECT VERB TEMPORAL
         'I have done (that) all the time up until now.'

The position of prepositional phrases relative to each other is somewhat fluid
as is normally the case for adjuncts. H;vwever, in the corpus of data it is clear
that there is a preference for su (associative and instrumental) phrases to
precede mo locative phrases.


Of the adjuncts, temporal phrases more commonly precede the subject as in
(11O), and they may be placed just like time adverbs illustrated in (96) above.


(1 10)   Su futmo ye                  mu nai su-git          mo   nggwe.
         with first      ~ I N D E F go get       NOM-eat LOC     garden
         'At first people went to get food from the garden.'

Prepositional phrases can occur in series as in the case of locative phrases
with the prepositions bot as in (107) above, and mo (111).


(111)    Yen         taru         mu mo nje         mo nden ms Syubun.
         ~ I N D E F send.message go LOC ~ I N D E   F bush LOC Syubun

         SUBJECTVERB                  LOCATIVE LOCATIVE LOCATIVE
         'They sent a message to the people in the bush at Syubun.'


4.5 Particles

The role of particles in Abun clauses is significant. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 in the
last section of this thesis are devoted to a discussion thereof. To complete the
general picture of Abun main clauses, here is a brief summary of the role of
particles used to convey notions of negation, aspect, modality and mood. They
all occur clause final in the following order:
                                                                   Abun clause structure 82




Each particle is optional. They may co-occur where semantically feasible.
Furthermore, the particle expressing negation may co-occur with another
particle, yo, which is preverbal, forming a linked pair, as discussed in 8.2.
Likewise the particle expressing interrogative mood may co-occur with a
sentence initial particle, te, forming a linked pair, as discussed in 6.1.


4.5.1 Negation

Givon (1984:336) comments that NEG-markers tend to attach themselves as
morphemic operators almost always to the verb.              However Abun differs
markedly from the norm in that its main NEG-marker,nde, is not attached to the
verb, and is frequently distant from the verb, being one of the clause final
particles. For prohibitive sentences nde is used as in (112) and (113), but for
negative indicatives the predicate (v, o and all ADJUNCTS) is bracketed by two
particles, yo and nde as seen in (114) and (115).            For a more detailed
discussion of negation see 8.1.

(112) Nggon git su-ge         ga    sye         nde.
     women eat NOM-body REL big                 NEG
     'Women must not eat big animals.'

(113) Nan    mu      nde.
     ~ S G 90        NEG
     'Don't go! .'

(114) An        YO         gwat    kwem           nde.
     ~ S G      NEG        bring   canoe          NEG
     SUBJECT NEGPCL VERB OBJECT                   NEGPCL
     'He did not bring the canoe.'

(I15) Ji       YO        syo     mbre         is Musa mo nu       n de.
      1SG        NEG      give antique.cloth to Musa Loc house NEG
     SUBJECTNEGPCL VERB OBJECT                 DATIVE    LOCATIVE NEGPCL
     'I didn't give antique cloth to Musa at the house.'
                                                                         Abun clause structure 83




    4.5.2 Aspect

    The verb in Abun is uninflected for either tense, mood or aspect. Aspect
'   particles add increments to the meaning of the verb and occur clause final. In
    Abun, aspect particles, which are optional, refer to the distribution of time or
    contour of an action or state of affairs. They are:




    Examples of each type are given in (116) to (118). For further details about
    aspect in Abun see 7. I.


    (116)An         we     mu       re.
             ~ P L fWO     g0       PERF
             SUBJECT       VERB ASPECT
             'They (two) had gone.'

    (I 17)   Nggon we sap       yu           it.
             women two slash each.other cOMPL
             SUBJECT VERB OBJECT             ASPECT
             'The two women had already slashed each other.'

    (1 18)   An           ben     suk       mo nggwe fb
             ~ S G        do      thing     LOC  garden INCOMPL
             SUBJECT VERB OBJECT LOCATIVE               ASPECT
             'He is still working in the garden'

    Aspect particles follow prepositional phrases and a final negative particle, nde,
    where present. It is uncommon for two aspect particles to occur together, but it
    is possible with a negated incomplete that is perfect as seen in (119).


    (I 19)   Ji        yo   jam      kom mo mit           nde     f6     re.
             1SG NEG know up.to LOC inside NEG                    INCOMPL PERF

I                                                                           Abun clause structure 84




    4.5.3 Modality

    Modal markers optionally occur where the attitude of the speaker is marked
    grammatically near the end of a clause, following negation or aspect particles
    and just preceding any mood marking. Modals in Abun are:

                        Ya               'POSSIBILI~', (120)
                        bayok            'PROBABILITY' ( I2 1)
                        go               'ASSERTIVE' ( I 22)


    They are all clause final, and where semantically possible may occur with
    negation, aspect and mood particles. For more details see 7.2. Examples are:


    (120)   Prisila    ma       sap     Barbarina      o         Ya.
            Prisila    come     cut     Barbarina      again     PosslB
            SUBJECT    VERB             OBJECT         ADVERB MODAL
            'Prisila might come and cut Barbarina again.'

    (123)   An        ben     suk        Ye        ndo nde       go       fe?
            ~ S G     do      things     difficult good NEG      ASST  CQM
            SUBJECT VERB      OBJECT     ADJECTIVAL PHRASE       MODAL MOOD
            'He really made things very very difficult, didn't he?'


    4.5.4 Mood

    According to Lyons (1968:307) the term mood "is best defined in relation to an
    'unmarked' class of sentences which express simple statements of fact,
    unqualified with respect to the attitude of the speaker towards what he is
    sayir ~g."
                                                                   Abun clause structure 8S




In Abun the indicative mood is unmarked while the other two basic types of
mood are marked by the use of particles which occur clause final. In addition
Abun also marks another mood, that of frustrated action. A list of all Abun
mood particles is given in table 3.16 in 3.4.5.


Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that
bracket the clause, te 'INITIAL QUESTION MARKER' for all types of questions and a
final question marker which is one of:

               ne         'INFORMATION    FINAL QUESTION MARKER'
                          (124)
               e          'YES-NO FINAL QUESTION MARKER' ( I 25)

               bad0       'ALTERNATIVE QUESTION MARKER'   (126)
               fe         'coNFIRMATIVE QUESTION MARKER' (127)


The initial question marker is optional, however the final question marker is
obligatory. More details of interrogative structure types are found in chapter 6.

    The initial question marker, te, is used to alert the hearer that a question is
    about to be asked. It is more commonly used within a complex sentence rather
    than simple sentences, as in (128). In a sample of 194 questions in the corpus
    of data, te occurred 41 times, that is about 21% of questions used te.


    (128) Nggwe ga            nan     kem sure te      nu    but bado,
          garden REL          ~ S   G live now IQM     ~ P L clear AQM

             'In the garden where you are living, have you cleared it (and worked it), or
             have pigs eaten the plants in the garden?'

    For imperative, the following particles are clause final, se (Abun Ji) and the
    dialectal variant, tom (Abun Tat)     'STRONG HORTATIVE'   (129), et 'MILD HORTATIVE'
    (130),nde 'PROHIBITIVE' (131). The unmarked form, 'BASIC IMPERATIVE' (132), is
    distinguished from indicative mood by context. For further discussion regarding
    imperative mood see 6.2.

    Frustrated action mood uses the particle ware, as in (133).                 The nearest
    English equivalent would be 'in vain', 'to no avail' or 'but without success.' It's
    meaning is that an action was attempted but the goal of the action was not
    achieved. It is clause final like other moods following modal markers. See 6.3
    for more details.

    4.6 Verbless clauses

    In Abun there is a small number of verbless clauses. Three of them are simply
    juxtaposed, while a fourth uses the complement particle, do to attribute a
    proper name. The four types are:

        Equational clauses:        attribute a nominal to the subject (134).

I       Name clauses:              attribute a proper name to the subject (135).
I


I       Descriptive clauses:       attribute an adjective to the subject (136).

        Locational clauses         attribute a location to the subject (137).

            Ofni     POSS house big
            'Ofni's house is big.'

    The first two types are negated by the use of nde only (see 8.1.3), while the
    latter two require the use of a linked pair of negative particles yo.. nde, as
    discussed in 8.2.3 and 8.2.4.


    Name clauses require the use of the complement particle. The same particle is
    also used to introduce direct and indirect speech.            For a full discussion

    regarding these complements in Abun, see C Berry (1995).



    4.7 Syntactic information packaging options in Abun clauses

    According to Foley & Van Valin (1985:299) there is a wide variety of syntactic
    information packaging options used in languages. They discuss the options of
    passive, dative shift, left-dislocation, topicalisation, and cleft constructions.


    Of these passive, dative shift, left-dislocation and cleft constructions, as
    defined by Foley & Van Valin, do not occur in Abun. However, passive-like
    constructions (4.7.1), topicalisation (4.7.2), and cleft-like constructions (4.7.3)
t
i   do occur in Abun.


    4.7.1 Passive-like voice

    According to Foley & Van Valin (1385:299) passives characteristically present
    the undergoer argument as the subject. They also sap that traditionally the
    subject has been described as the constituent which specifies what the
    sentence is about, meaning that passive scsntences are understood to be about
    the untergoer argument.


    In Abun there is no passive construction as such, but a shif~in focus of a
    sentence, or, what the sentence is about, to the undergoer argument can be
    achieved by a different means. In Abun this is achieved by using an indefinite
I
I
                                                                    Abun clause structure 89




    pronoun, ye as subject of a sentence. This effectively removes focus from the
    subject by backgrounding the subject, and so transfers focus to the undergoer
    argument.. So instead of saying, 'The bag was taken to the bush', the Abun
    people say , 'Someone took the bag to the bush' as in (138).


    (138)   Ye       gwat yu     ne     mu     mo    nden.
            ~ ~ N D Etake
                      F   i,sg the go          LOC   bush
            'The bag was taken to the bush.'

    The sentence here is about the bag, not about the indefinite subject, 'someone'.
    The use of an indefinite pronoun in this way therefore results in a semantic
    force similar to an agentless passive.


    This is similar to what Foley & Van Valin (1985334) say, "There are many
    languages that lack all of the constructions... [of both backgrounding and
    foregrounding passives]. Nevertheless, they do have means of expressing that
    a non-actor is more important than the actor.", as seen in (138) above.



    4.7.2 Topicalisation

    Foley & Van Valin (1985:355) define topicalisation as a procedure used to
    place an NP other than a subject sentence-initial.       In contrast to passive
    structures which are clause-internal, Foley & Van Valin consider topicalisation
    as clause-external. They say, "Topicalisation ... involve(s) the occurrence of an
    external topic NP followed by a sentence which relates to it in some way."


    In Abun, simple prepositioning is used to foreground objects and mo locative
    phrases with no pronoun trace lef! in the sentence. The foregrounded item
    becomes the topic upon wh~cha comment follows. For example,
                                                                  Abun clause structure 90



(139) Yu        ne    Ye      gwat mu mo nden.
        bag ANAPH ~ I N D E F take go      to bush
        'The bag, someone took (it) to the bush.' or 'The bag was taken to the
        bush.'

(140)M0         nden ne         men   git    boge.
     LOC        bush ANAPH 1PL        eat    fish
        'In the bush we ate fish.'

Foley & Van Valin (1985:356) claim that "...the primary functions of these
[topicalised] constructions are to introduce new referents into a discourse, or to
reintroduce a referent which was previously introduced but which has not been
mentioned in the immediately preceding discourse."


The function of topicalisation in Abun is the second of those mentioned above,
namely, to reintroduce a previously introduced referent. However, the referent
may have been mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence, such as in
(141 ).


(141)   An      mu    me     su-git         yak mo      nden.
        ~ S G   go    see    NOM-eat        jump LOC    outside

        Sar-git jon    ne    men grem kop               mo    dapur.
        NoM-eat cooked ANAPH IPL put aside              Loc   kitchen

        'He went quickly outside to see the food. The cooked food, we had put
        aside in the kitchen.'

In Abun topicalisation does not occur in isolation. The object or location must
have been mentioned in previous discussion. For this reason, in all cases of
topicalisation in Abun, the determiner, or more specifically, the anaphoric
referent, ne, is obligatory.     In (141) 'food' was already mentioned in the
sentence previous to the one where it is topicalised.


Foley & Van Valin (1985301) also make the point that in most languages
passive is restricted to core constituents while topicalisation is not. In Abun
    1

                                                                           Abun clause structure 91




        such passive-like constructions are limited to the core, whereas topicalisation is
        also possible with peripheral constituents, but only with mo locative phrases, as
        seen in (142). Topicalisation of other phrase types such as benefactive (143)
        or instrumental (144) is unacceptable to an Abun speaker.


        (I 42)   MO kampung mit ne                an gu ye           or        re.
                 LOC village       inside ANAPH ~ S Gkill ~ I N D E Fc~mpletelyPERF
                 'Inside that village she had killed everyone.'

I       (143)    *Wa   Wonja Marta kon su-git.
                 BEN Wonja Marta cook N o ~ - e a t
                 'For Wonja, Marta cooked food.'

        (144)    *Su mbam an           gu ndar ne        kwop.
                 with axe      3sG kill dog DET          die
                 'With an axe he killed the dog.'

        Regarding the frequency of topicalisation in Abun, in a sample of five different
        stories by five different speakers, seven examples of topicalisation were found,
        four of object fronting, and three of mo locative phrase fronting.                  This
        represented about 1.5% of the clauses examined.                Thus topicalisation,
        although possible, is uncommon in Abun.



        4.7.3 Cleft-like constructions

        According to Huddleston (1984:459) the general effect of a cleft construction is
        to give added prominence to a particular constituent, which he calls the
        highlighted element.


        The Abun equivalent of what translates across into English as a cleft is not
        syntactically a cleft construction.      In other words, there is no subordinate
        clause, or division into two clauses that causes prominence of a particular
        constituent.      Instead a particle anato serves to highlight the constituent
        immediately preceding it, and intensifies any focus or topics already structured.
                                                                  Abun clause structure 92




For example, compare unmarked (145a) with the cleft-like construction in

(145b),

(145)   a. Ron bi wa men.
           Ron pay for IPL
           'Ron paid for us.'

        b. Ron ana-to       bi     wa      men.
           Ron FOC-NMP pay for             IPL
           'It was Ron who paid for us.' or 'Ron is the one who paid for us.'

Anato is a compound of ana 'FOCUS'and to          'NOUN MODIFYING PARTICLE'.          TO
usually indicates that embedding will follow. Such embedding refers back to
and modifies the noun preceding.           In other words, to introduces more
information about the preceding noun. So we know that any noun followed by
to is going to have some modification. In this case the additional information
conveyed by adding to to the noun is that of prominence, highlighting or
additional focus.
5. Phrase structure

The structure of phrases in Abun is consistent with what has already been
stated about its syntax, namely, that fixed word order and particles, rather than
affixation, are used to signify meaning.


This chapter consists of a survey of phrase types, namely, verb phrases (5.1),
noun phrases (5.2). possessive phrases (5.3),prepositional phrases (5.4).
adverbial and adjectival phrases (5.5), quantifier phrases (5.6) and complex
phrases (5.7). The head of each phrase type is indicated by word order, and
word order alone. The table below summarises the structure of each of these
phrase types.

5.1 Verb phrases

For the purposes of this discussion we shall define a verb phrase not as a total
predicate, but limited to the verb and its modifiers, as discussed by Schachter
(1985:41). In Abun, verb phrases are defined as consisting of a verb as head,
with optional predicate markers and verbal particles.


Auxiliaries, which carry notions of tense, aspect, mood, modality, polarity and
voice are not considered as part of the Abun verb phrase since they are
~eparatedfrom the verb, not only by any object, but also by any adverbs and
adjuncts in the sentence. Aspect, mood, polarity and modality particles can
only be contiguous with the verb when there are no object(s), adverbs or
adjuncts. Therefore, for Abun, such particles are not analysed here as part of
the verb phrase, but are considered separately because they operate on the
clause level. They are discussed separately in chapters 6, 7, and 8.


Thus an Abun verb phrase consists of
                  (PREDICATE    MARKER)VERB* (VERBALPARTICLE)
      ('a direct object, where present, occurs between its verb and the verbal particle)


One of the two modifying components is a predicate marker particle. There are
four predicate marker particles which always directly precede the verb when
present. They are listed in the table below:
                          TABLE5.2 - PREDICATE
                                             MARKERS

        Particle                              Meaning

           yo       did not happen
           waii     happened exactly as before (same verb and
                    object)

           da       did actually happen

           do       is in the process of happening together with ...
                                                                   Abun phrase structure 95




The first of these particles, yo, is the first particle of a linked pair of particles,
where the second particle is nde 'NEGATIVE'.           YO occurs only in negative
indicative sentences (146). For further discussion of this predicate marker and
its role in delineating the scope of negation see 8.5.


(146)   An yo         ma     mo       nu    nde.
        ~ P LNEG     come LOC         house NEG
        'They did not come to the house.'

The second of the predicate markers, waii, indicates that the action is the same
type of action as the previous one. The object is also the same type of object,
as seen in the sentences below:


(147)   Men mu nai sugit ete Apner ki       nai lsak do      Nan waii mu nai sugit.
        1PL go get food then Apner said to lsak COMP 250 also go get food
        'We went to get food, then Apner said to lsak, 'You also go and get some
        food".

(148)   An we sam nyim mo nu                   efe men waii sam wan.
        3 s ~ two carry ahead LOC house then IPL          also carry behind
        'They (two) carried (things) ahead of us to the house and we also carried
        (things) after them.'

The third and fourth predicate markers are used in complex sentences only.
Below is one example of each. For further discussion see C Berry (1995).


(149)    Yunus da         sok-wa      lsak sare...
        Yunus actually look-TRANSlsak but
        'Yunus actually looked at lsak but (he didn't do anything).'

(150)   Men do is              mone sa               men yo ku auto nde.
        ~ P L PM came.down there then(~EALls)~ P LNEG find car      NEG
        'And when we landed there we did not find a car.'

The other modifying component of Abun verb phrases is verbal particles which
are particles attached to certain verbs, like 'up' in the English, 'He looked up
the words.', which may, in English, also be in the form, 'He looked the words
up.' This type of verbal particle is referred to by Schachter (1985:45) who
    I
                                                                           Abun phrase strudure 96



1
1       comments that they frequently have a directional or locative notion. Abun has

        similar forms. Take, for example,


        (151) a       An     gwat     buku     ma     mo     nu.
                      3so carry book           come LOC      house
                      'He brought the book to the house.'

                 b. An       gwat     buku      mu     mo    nu.
                      3SG carry       book      go     LOC   house
                      'He took the book to the house.'

        (152)    Pa    bare jamsem         ne     we       mo        nden.
                 child throw cassava       DET    away LOC           outside
                 'The child threw away the cassava outside.'

        (1 53)   An    grem buku ne          kwop mo         nu    mit.
                 ~ S G put     book DET down LOC             house inside
                 'He put the book down inside.'

        In English the verbal particles 'up', 'down' and so on, may be continuous or
        discontinuous with the verb. In Abun, however, the particle is discontinuous
        when there is a direct object, as seen in the examples above. When the verb is
        intransitive, the verbal particle is continuous with the verb, as in:


        (154)Nan         jam we.
                 ~ S G move away
                 'Get out of the way!'

        Schachter (1985:45) states that in some languages verbal particles are derived
        from adpositions, while in other languages they are not. None of the Abun
        verbal particles appear to have been derived from adpositions. Instead most of
        the verbal particles are derived from verbs, mu 'go', ma 'come', kwop 'die'.
        Some, such as we 'away' are only used as verbal particles.
                                                                   Abun phrase structure 97



    5.2 Noun phrases
I
    An Abun noun phrase typically has the following structure:

                               HEAD (MODIFIERS) (DETERMINER)



    The head of a noun phrase is normally filled by a member of the noun word
    class as in (155), but may also be filled by a pronoun, as in (156)' with a
    restricted set of modifiers, that is, other nouns and adjectives do not co-occur
    with a pronoun when it is head of a noun phrase, only classifiers, quantifiers
    and determiners may co-occur with pronouns, as seen in ( I 56).


    (155)    Ndar kwo      git   boge ge       we     or        re.
             dog white eat fish CLASS two completely PERF
             'The white dog had completely eaten the two fish.'

    (156)    An      ka        we    ne    git   boge.
             ~ P L CLASS       fw0   DET   eat   fish
             'Those two ate fish.'

    A proper name will usually occur alone, but may be modified by a relative
    clause, as seen in (157).


    (I 57)   Mauren gat0 kwop r6 ...
             Mauren REL die        recently
             Mauren who had died recently...

    Modifiers are optional. The types, their order and co-occurrence restrictions
    are discussed below in 5.2.1.


    Determiners, like modifiers, are optional. They are used less frequently than
    determiners are in English. They will be discussed in 5.2.2 below.


    Since modifiers and determiners are optional frequently a noun phrase consists
    of a single noun, for example:
I                                                                      Abun phrase structure 98



    (I 58) Fredik     bari-wa           git   yetu.
            Fredik not.want-TRANS eat people
            'Fredik does not want to eat people.'

    Noun phrases fill subject and object positions, as seen in the examples below.
    They also fill head positions in possessive phrases and prepositional phrases
    which shall be discussed in sections 5.3 and 5.4 respectively.


    (159)   Men dakai git nok             ku     koi     bok    YO.
            ~ P L REFL   eat wild.pig flesh CMss several DET
            'We ourselves ate several pieces of wild pig meat.'

    (160)    Yetu ge       we gwa ndar er             ne    su       kwe koi.
            people CLASS two hit        dog red DET with             wood piece
            'Two men hit the red dog with a piece of wood.'


    5.2.1 Noun phrase modifiers

    All modifiers in noun phrases are posthead. They occur after the head and
    before any determiner which may occur.             Such modifiers may consist of
    members from each of the following classes of words or phrases.


              other nouns
              adjectival phrase, consisting of adjectives such as colour (black, white),
              size (big, small) or quality (hard, soft), followed by an optional
              intensifier
              quantifier phrase, optionally preceded by a classifier, with quantifiers:
                            general (many, few, some)
                            cardinal numerals (one, two ...)
                            ordinal numerals (first, second)
    These modifiers appear in the noun phrase in the following order:
    I
                                                                                 Abun phrase structure 99




1       For example:
        (161)   nok      ku       sye teker       koi          bok         YO-
                wild.pig flesh    big INTENSE     CLASS        several     DET
                HEAD     NOUN     ADJ PHRASE      CLASS        QUANT       DET
                'several very big pieces of wild pig meat.'

        A noun phrase of the type given in the example above, although acceptable to
        an Abun speaker, is rather 'heavy'. By that we mean normally they would not
        include as many modifiers together in this way.                  In order to retain the
        modification in a more natural style, various strategies are employed to limit the
        number of modifiers in any one noun phrase. These are discussed later in this
        section.


        Each modifier type will now be discussed with further examples.


        First, other nouns may modify the head of a noun phrase.                      This type of
        construction is usually referred to as a complex noun phrase, but since the
        addition of another noun following the head modifies the head analogous to
        other modifiers we have chosen to discu:              as a modifier. Examples of this
        type are:

        (162)   nggwe jamsem ne
                garden cassava DET
                'the cassava garden'

        (163)   mbre             toba sak       gn
                eastern.cloth toba CLASS three
                'three lengths of "toba" cloth'

        The use of adjectival phrases as modifiers of the heads of noun phrases is by
        far the most common type of modification. In most cases an adjectival phrase

        is realised by a single adjective only, such as colour (164), size (165), and
        quality (166). This type of modification follows any other nouns that modify the
                                                                      Abun phrase structure 100




    head of the noun phrase. For more complex examples of adjectival phrases
    see 5.5.

I
I   (164)   Ye      gu minda kri.
I           people kill butterfly yell~w.
            'They killed yellow butterflies.'

    (165) 0 s        nggwof ne
            path narrow       DET
            'the narrow path'

    (166)   0s      ibit   yo
            way     bad    DET
            'a bad way'

    Quantifier phrases may have either general quantifier, an ordinal numeral or a
    cardinal numeral as its head, and is preceded by an optional classifier when
    the head is general quantifier or ordinal numeral, and an obligatory classifier
    when the head is a cardinal numeral. See 5.6 for a discussion of quantifier
    phrases. Some examples are:


    (167) Nggon(ge) mwa ma.
         woman CLASS many come.
         'Many women came.'

    (168)       An       bi      nu             (ke)     do-gri.
         3 s ~ poss house CLASS                 the.one.which-three
         'His house is the third one.'

    (169)          Ji       ku    ndar sye ge at.
            ISG    meet dog big CLASS four
            'I found four big dogs.'



    Within an Abun noun phrase there are limitations concerning modifiers. There
    are, of course, semantic restrictions as to which modifiers may co-occur with
    others, but apart from that, there is pressure to limit the number of modifiers,
    such that the maximun noun phrase will normally include only one of each type
    of modifier. Thus a noun phrase with two adjectives is unacceptable. If a
I
I
                                                                     Abun phrase structure 101




    speaker desires to say something like 'two big white dogs', which involves two
    adjectives, it is unacceptable to the Abun speaker to say (170); rather,
    relativisation is usually employed, as in (171a, b).


    (170)*ndar kwo      sye ge we
         dog white big C W ~ S two
         'two big white dogs'

    (171)a. ndar kwo      ge    we     gat0 sye
            dog white clAss two REL big
            'two white dogs that are big' or 'two big white dogs'

         b. ndar sye ge          we    gat0 kwo
            dog big body two REL white
            'two big dogs that are white' or 'two big white dogs'

    One may posit that the relative clause modifies the noun phrase as a whole
    since it follows the determiner, as seen in (172) below. (See further discussion



    (172)suk   wokgan yo       gat0 men mbrinket
         thing small     DET REL       1PL    forget
         'some small things that we forgot' or 'some small forgotten things'

    Alternatively, frequently the speaker may also juxtapose one of the adjectives
    in the form of an appositional verbless clause, as seen in (173). This type of
    modification is more typical when the noun phrase fills the object position. In
    this case the modification is syntactically outside of the noun phrase, it is like a
    parenthetical comment.


    (173)ndar     kwo ge        we, ndar ne          sye
         dog      white body two dog DET             big
         'twc, white dogs, the dogs are big"


    5.2.2 Determiners in noun phrases

    There are five distinct types of determiners used in Abun noun phrases. The
    first type is the unspecific/specific distinction.     The others are:        deictics,
                                                                    Abun phrase structure 102




anaphoric referents (which refer to a previously mentioned personlthing),
external referents (which refer to the proximity of an item in relation to the
speaker), and reflexives.          Both anaphoric and external referents may
compound with deictics. These particles occur in phrase final position. Table
5.2 lists each type and the relevant particles, each of which will be discussed in
turn below.




       Type                                   Particles


   Specificity                                                    'the, that'
                  YQ         'a, some'         ne
                             'Unspecific                          Specific


   Deictics            56 'this, here'     ne 'that, there'   tu 'over there'


   Anaphoric           ga-r6    latter/    ga-ne    former/   ga-tu     back.

   Referents                    recent              then                then

   External          to-r6      is.here    to-ne    isthere   to-tl.4   isover.

   Referents                                                            there

   Reflexive     dakai '-self                  wadigan           '-self alone'




The first determiner type of specificity contrasts unknown/known or
unspecifidspecific and requires the use of the par!icles yo 'a, some' for the
former and ne 'the' for the latter. The following examples illustrate each of
these determiners:


(174) An   rem    kwokwe       bo      YO-
     ~ S G had    egg.plant    CLASS DET
     'She had some egg plants (unspecific quantity)'
!
                                                                      Abun phrase stnrcture 103




    (175)Ye          yo bi     nggarmom muk yo.
         person DET give iron                 piece DET
         'Someone gave a piece of iron (to him)' (unknown personlpiece of iron)

    (I76) Nggon    ne it     san       dik   yo.
         woman DET wear clothes one          DET
         'The woman wore a dress.' (known woman, unspecific dress)

    The second type of determiner, the deicfic type, has the form r&, ne or tu.
    These refer to locational or temporal characteristics of the situation within
    which an utterance takes place. Ye 'person' in combination with each of these
    results in


         ye r6    'this person (here)'

         ye ne    'that person (there)'

         ye to    'those people (distant)'

    There is a progression from close to near to distant in meaning from r6 to ne to
    tu, not only in a locative sense, but also in a temporal sense, recent, not-so-
    recent to distant past, as well as in a referential sense, r6 'this (just previously
    referred to)', ne 'that' (slightly further removed reference)' and to 'that (distant)
    (even further removed)'. Each of these senses is determined from the context.


    Examples of each of the deictics are below. The temporal meaning of now, or
    at some other time is seen in (177) and (179), reference to Fredik (meaning the
    one we know (or can locate, as distinct from other Frediks) in (177)' and
    locative meanings of the deictics, 'here' in (177), 'there' in (179) and 'distant' in
    (180) and (181). See table 3.10 in 3.4 for a list of these and other determiner
    compounds.


    (177)s~ re         Fredik 6         kem       mo-r6        re.
         with DET      Fredik DET lives           LOC-DET      PERF
         'Now this Fredik already lives here.'
                                                                         Abun phrase structure 104


Ii   (1 78)   Men ki-bot         suk-du ne.
              IPL say-about NOM-speak DET
              'We discussed that news.'

     (179)Su        ne     nggon ne        ben suk-ibit       mo-ne.
              with DET woman DET do              NoM-bad LOC-DET
              'At that time, that woman did a bad thing there.

     (180)     Ye    ket-bot     nden      tu.
              people way-along bush        DET
              'They went along the distant bush (track).'

     (181)    An    we ne m u mo banbo                    tu           nim
              ~ S G two   DET go        LOC    mountain DET            east
              Those two went to the distant eastern mountain.'

     The deictic, tu, can have the meaning 'respected', rather than distant, in
     relation to oldlrespected men or women, yenggras tu 'that oldlrespected man'
     and nggongras tu 'that oldlrespected women'.             The idea of respect also

     encompasses those who are more powerful, as in the example below of a
     killing party:


     (182)    Yeko          ne    hop      or.        Yeko          tu
              killing.party DET   die      completely killing.party ~ ~ ~ ( r e s p e c t e d )
              ana   mu     gu     ye       ne     or         re.
              TOP   g0     kill   people   DET    completely PERF

              'That killing party completely died. The (other respectedhetter) killing
              party were the ones who had completely killed those people.'

     A third type of determiner is that of anaphoric referent. One particle, ga, is
     used to refer back to a person or thing mentioned. This can be used to
     distinguish several people of the same name who could be understood to be
     part of a story as in the examples:


     (183)    Ji       sok-bot      Yohana      ga.
              1SG      look-about Yohana        ANAPH
              'I looked at Yohana (previously mentioned).'

     (184) Prisita ga           sa.
              Prisila ANAPH laugh
              Prisila (previously mentioned) laughed.
                                                                      Abun phrase strudure 105




Or, when a person has been mentioned and the speaker wants to ensure that
the hearers understand that the pronoun, in the example below, an              ' ~ s G ' does
                                                                                         ,

actually mean the last person mentioned, the anaphoric referent is added.


(185)    Ji      si     an      ga      mu mo nden.
         ISG     with ~ S G ANAPH g0 LOC bush
         'I together with him (previously mentioned) went to the bush.'

This anaphoric referent may then also be combined with the deictics, r6, ne or
tu to produce the compounds gar6, gane and gatu. (It is on the basis of word
final stress patterning that these forms are considered as compounds.) The
difference between these three compounds is the proximity of reference in the
mind of the speaker. Those persons or things that were mentioned are referred
to by the use of gare 'thislthese, just mentioned' as in (186) and (187); gane
'thatlthose, just mentioned' as in (188) and (189); and gatu 'thatlthose,
mentioned in the past' as in (190).


(186)    Nggon we ga-re             ben suk-ndo.
         women two ANAPH-here do           NOM-~OO~
         'These two women do things well.'

(187)    Nggon we      ben suk ga-re            ndo.

         'The two women did these things well.'

(188)An         git    n               ga-ne.
         ~ S G eat     ginger.root     ANAPH-there
         'He ate that ginger root. (that one previously mentioned)'

(189)    Ji       ku    suk-ye         mwa ga-ne.

         'I had those many difficulties.

         ~ P L deceive 1SG LOC woman ANAP~-there(distant) COMPL
         'You have deceived me about those women (the ones you talked about in
         the distant past)'
                                                                Abun phrase structure 106




The fcurth type of determiner is the external referent, to. This particle refers to
the external setting where the utterance occurs and the proximity of the person
or thing under discussion to that place. When this particle occurs as a free
form, it introduces additional modifying phrases or clauses (see 5.2.3). It may
also compound with the deictic particles r6, ne and tu, and is used by a
speaker who wants to make reference to something he is touching while he
speaks, tore in (191) and (192)' or he is pointing to while he speaks, tone in
(193), or he is pointing to in the distance, tofu in (194).


(191) An      gwa ji      gro to-re.
     3SG      kit   1SG eye EXTREF-here
     'He hit my eye (speaker is pointing to his eye).'

(192) Men   kem mo kampung to-re.
     ~ P L live      LOC village        EXTREF-here
     'We live in this village (the one where the speaker relates the story).'

(193) Nan   me ji         de     to-ne.
     ZSG see ISG          blood EXTREF-there
     'See my blood (the speaker points to it)'

(194) Nggon   we ma mo banbo               to-tu.
     women two came LOC mountain EXTREF-there(distant)
     The two women came to that mountain (speaker points to location in the
     distance)'

The final type of determiner is reflexives such as himself, yourself, and
themselves. The form dakai 'REFLEXIVE',is used for all persons and numbers
and usually co-occurs with a pronoun or person's name, as seen in the (195)
and (196), but also co-occurs with nouns modified by quantifiers (197).


(I 95) Yemina   dakai   kon      Barbarina wip         ne        SOT.
     1SG       REFL     cook Barbarina sore DET                 just
     'Just Yemina herself cared for Barbarina's sore.'

(I 96) Men i-wa         men dakai ki-bot            men dakai.

     'We ourselves wanted to talk about ourselves.'
                                                                     Abun phrase structure 107



    (197)Nggon       ge    gri    dakai mu.
            woman c u s s three REFL       90
            'The three women themselves went.'

t
    In addition, the form, wadigan 'alone' is reflexive, meaning 'by himselflalone',
i
I
I
    'by itselflalone', 'by themselveslalone' and so on, as in the examples below:


    (I 98) sugit    suge        wadigan
            food animal         alone
            'meat by itself or 'meat alone' or 'only meat'

    (199)mbre               sye wadigan
            antique.cloth big alone
            'valuable antique cioth alone'

    This form implies separateness from other people or things, while dakai implies
    a distinctiveness from other people. So in (200), lsak was by himself rowing
    the canoe, no one else was present. Whereas if dakai replaced wadigan then
    the implication is that lsak as distinct from the others rowed the canoe, that is,
    there could have been others with him in the canoe.

            'Isak rowed the canoe by himself .' or 'lsak alone rowed the canoe.'


    5.2.3 Post-determiner noun phrase modifiers

    There are other ways to modify a noun phrase apart from using the modifiers
    discussed above. Phrases or clauses may be added to a noun phrase by the
    use of to 'NOUN MODIFYING PARTICLE', or by the juxtaposition of locative
    prepositional phrases (in order to modify the head of the noun phrase in regard
    to its location). A special case, sin0 'all together', is also discussed at the end
    of this section.


    In these instances an Abun noun phrase consists of:

                        HEAD   (MODIFIERS) (DETERMINER)(MODIFIERS)
                                                                   Abun phrase structure 108




    Usually only one modifier follows the determiner, but more than one is possible
    as in (213) below.


    The noun modifying particle (NMP) introduces a phrase or clause which
    modifies the head of a noun phrase. Phrases and clauses introduced by NMP
    are added to the noun phrase and modify it. Consider the example:


    (201)   WO suk-fo           to ndam syor            ne yo,        nu-we git nde.
            but thing-tab00 NMP bird cassowary DET then.l~R2 ~ ~ - t w O e NEG    at
            'But a forbidden thing, that is the cassowary, you two must not eat.'

    The phrase 'the cassowary' introduced by the NMP, modifies the forbidden thing.
    Again in (202) below the noun banbo 'mountain' is modified by the addition of
    the phrase 'the Waibe'.


    (202)   Men gwa bei yam0 banbo                to     Waibe ne     de     rut.
            Ip     beat sago at       mountain NMP Waibe DET side far
            'We beat the sago on the mountain, that is on Waibe mountain on the far
            side.'

    The NMP also joins unrestrictive relative clauses to a noun phrase in order to
    modify a noun as seen in the following example:


    (203)   An    ki     nai   Martinus    to-re       to     kra   Domingas
            ~ S G say    to    Martinus    EXTREF-this REL    marry Domingas
            ne    bi     ai     gum do          Simam     Yorfen do...
            DET   POSS   father name COMP       Simam     Yorfen COMP
            'He said to Martinus' father (the Martinus (who lives) here, who married
            Domingas) (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that ...'

    When sa 'like, as' compounds with to, the compound form sat0 'for
    examplelsuch as' results.      The use of this form precedes complex noun
    phrases which are added to modify or explain the head of the noun phrase, as
    seen in the example below.        (See 5.7 for more details on complex noun
    phrases.)

    /I   Furthermore the anaphoric referent ga also compounds with to and forms gato,
         the relative conjunction, which is used to form restrictive relative clauses.
    :
         Examples show how they modify the nouns in the phrases below. Note that the
    1



         form ne 'DET' is frequently a relative ciause boundary marker, as distinct from
         the same form ~ s e as
                             d a determiner in the noun phrase.


         (205)    Suk-jan gato Bn              jan    mo nggwe ne       bere te.
                  NOM-plant REL        ~ P L plant LOC garden DET       later die
                  'Plants that they plant in that garden will die.'

         (206)    Men mu de      syur mo syur wak gat0 nje               ben ne.
                  1PL go go.in water LOC water hole REL people make DET
                  'We went and washed at the well that people had made.'

                  elder       REL   Mauren REL die     recently FOC      come
                  'The elder whose (name was) Mauren who died recently was the one who
                  came.'

         Such clauses also modify the head of a noun phrase, and are one possible
         option where the speakers desire to include more than one adjectival type of
         modification to a noun phrase as explained in 5.2.1 above. For more details
         regarding restrictive and unrestrictive relative clauses see C. Berry (1995).


         A locative prepositional phrase frequently modifies the head of a noun phrase,
         as in the following examples. The clothes spoken of in (208) are 'clothes at the
         sea' which modifies the noun, clothes, to mean modern clothes as distinct from
,
         'clothes in the bush' which means the traditional bark cloth worn in the bush.


         (208)    san     mo sem ne.
                  clothes LOC sea DET
                  'modern clothes ('sea' clothes cf 'bush' clothes).'
I   Thus it is clear which garden in (209), and which people in (210) (211) are


I   being spoken about.


    (209)   mo      nggwe mo banbo            to-tu         nim
            LOC garden L o c mountain EXTREF-there(distant) east
            'at the garden on the distant eastern mountain'

            ~ P L LOC Fef came LOC Syurur Sye
            'You Fef (people) come to Syurur Sye.' or 'You in Fef come to Syurur Sye.'

    (211)    Yetu   mwa mo nu               mit      ne        gu       Yu-
            people many LOC house inside DET                   fight    REClP
            'Many people in the house fought each other.'

    Finally, there is a special modifier that occurs after determiners, namely, sino
    'allltogether'. Sino is always the final constituent of a noun phrase whenever it
    occurs as seen in (212) and (213). It modifies the whole phrase similar to
    relative clauses. This is similar also to English where 'all' modifies the whole
    noun phrase as in 'all the king's men...'.


    (212)   yenggras mwa          ne    sin0
            old.men     many      DET   all
            'all the many cld respected men'

    (2I3)   ye- wis          ~i     ga     mo bur r6         sin0
            person-family other REL LOC land this            all
            'all the other tribes which are in this land'

    This modifier is out of character with all the other single word modifiers in that it
    follows the determiner. It could be that it was originally a phrase si no 'with
    completeness' that hss compounded to form the single word. In that case sino
    would be considered as a noun phrase itself and the whole utterance would be
    considered as two noun phrases conjoined, with si no being the second noun
    phrase. For further discussion of complex phrases see 5.7.
                                                               Abun phrase structure 111




5.3 Possessive phrases

Abun has two possessive constructions types which in other languages have
been referred to as 'alienable' and 'inalienable' possession (Crystal 1985:12).
Alienable possession is that type of possession where the item possessed
(hereafter known as possessum) is seen as having only a temporary, or non-
essential dependence on the possessor such as, 'his house', or 'the woman's
book'. On the other hand, inalienable possession is where the possessum has
a permanent or necessary relationship with the possessor such as 'her arm'.


Of the ten different genitive construction types discussed by Croft (1990:28-32)'
Abun makes use of only two, and uses them to distinguish between alienable
and inalienable possession. The first of these construction types used in Abun
is simple juxtaposition of two noun phrases, one representing the possessor
and one representing the possessum. This type of construction is used to
form Abun inalienable genitive constructions, as in (214). Frequently the noun
phrases are realised by only a pronoun and a noun, juxtaposed in that order,
as seen in (215).


(214)    Ndar sye ne          gwes de-dari       fot.
         dog     big DET leg           side-back broken
         POSSESSOR(NP) POSSESSUM (NP)
         'The big dog's back leg is broken.'

(215 )   Ji    syim fot.
         ISG   arm     broken
         'My arm was broken.'

A less common strategy discussed by Croft (1990:32) is that of the use of a
linker.     He says, "The linker is invariant or contrasts only with simple
juxtaposition, and functions merely to link the possessor and head noun
grammatically." This is the second type of genitive construction found in Abun.
Abun alienable genitive constructions use this type of strategy.                  The
                                                                  Abun phrase structure 112




possessive marker, bi is a linker. It links the possessor and the possessum, as
seen in (216), (217) and (218).

(216)Gap sye         ne     bi      gan       ge           we     hop       re.
        rat   big    DET    POSS    young.one CLASS        WO     die       PERF
        POSSESSOR                    POSSESSUM
        'The big rat's two young offspring had died.'

(2 '1 7) Ji     ben ji      bi     nggwe.
        ISG     do    ISG   ~ o s sgarden
        'I made my garden.'

(2 1 8) Jj      bi     pa    ge    we       mu     rno    nu.
        ISG     POSS child CLASS two        go     LOC    house
        'My two children went home.'

The noun phrase that represents the possessor undergoes no morphological
change when it is juxtaposed or linked to the possessum. The possessum
likewise is not marked morphologically in any way. Even the linker, bi, can be
shown to be a free form (and will be in 5.3.2) and thus be considered separate
from both the possessum or the possessor.                Abun possessive phrases
syntactically appear to be like coordinate noun phrases, one form juxtaposed
and the other using the linker bi as the coordinating particle, just like si is used
to conjoin noun phrases (see 5.7).


Consistent with the absence of morphological marking in possessive phrases
noted here, Abun does not have a set of possessive pronouns, but uses the
same set of pronouns as are used in all other phrase types. In contrast to this,
in an early cursory analysis of Abun (previously named, Karon), Voorhoeve
wrote (in Wurm 1975:720) that possessive prefixes had been noted with
kinship terms:      tabai 'my father' and nambai 'your father', being cited as
examples. However in slow speech these two forms are: tat bi ai 'ISG
                                                                   POSS

father: my father' and nan bi ai ' 2 s poss
                                       ~    father: your father' (these phrases are
in the Abun tat dialect, where tat is 'IsG'). No markings are made on either the
    !                                                                  Abun phrase structure 113




        head or the dependenl in possessive phrases.            The same pronouns are

        employed in possessive phrases as are employed in noun phrases that occur
        in subject and object positions, that is, there is no special set of possessive
        pronouns in Abun. In this way Abun differs from many other languages.


        The choice of which type of possessive construction to employ is determined
        by the lexicon. The inalienable class of nouns which includes body parts,
        name, and analogously, the parts of whole-part relationships such as tree-
        trunk, fish-scales, as discussed in 3.2.3, is restricted and could be considered a
        closed set All other nouns belong to an open set of nouns and includes names
        of places, objects, kinship terms, and advice.        Many languages with the
        alienablelinalienable distinction include kinship terms in the inalienable
        category, but, in Abun, kinship terms are considered to be alienable.


        Now we turn to a more detailed discussion of each of the two types of genitive
        constructions, inalienable (5.3.1) and alienable (5.3.2).



        5.3.1 Inalienable possession

        Abun inalienable possessive phrases may be represented as:




        where for pronominal reference the possessor may be replaced by i- in the
        case of non-human referents or be elided in the case of body part referents.


        In inalienable possession, the possessor and the possessum are simply

1
        juxtaposed as in (219). This type of possessive construction is used for body
I
I       parts (such as my arm, his leg) and more generally for whole-part relationships
                                                                     Abun phrase structure 114




    (such as tree-leaves, deer-meat, house-opening (doorway). Also a person's
    name is considered as inalienable possession, as in (220) and (221).


    (219)Wo        kwai tik       Sepenyel gwes.
            fish   kwai pull Sepenyel          leg
            'The Kwai fish pulled Sepenyel's leg.'

    (220)An        gum do        Marta.
            ~ S G name COMP Marta
            'Her name is Marta.'

    (221) Marta gum sye           do     Yekese.
            Marta name big COMP Yekese
            'Marts's surname is Yekese.'

    VJhole-part relationships, in principle, follow the same structure as inalienable
    possessive phrases, and could be analysed as separate words or as
    compounds. Here they are analysed as compounds since the possessum is a
    bound root. It never stands on its own in normal utterance. It is structurally
    bound to the preceding word, which represents the 'whole'. So rom 'liquid' in
    (222) is bound to 'coconut'. No evidence has been found that words like rom
    have ever been free forms.


    (222)   Ji        da    gur-rom.
            1SG       drink coconut-liquid
            'I drink coconut milk.'

    The 'whole' may not just be a single word, but may also be a noun phrase, 'a
    young coconut', that compounds with the bound root, 'liquid', as seen in (223).


    (223)   da     [gur       bo     dekfirom     si      git i-ka      nde     e
            drink coconut cmss young-liquid with eat its-flesh NEG              and
            '...don't drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh, and..


1
    There is one structural difference between inalienable possessive phrases and

1   whole-part' compounds and that is the possessor in the phrase may be elided,
                                                               Abun phrase structure 115




is replaced with a prefix i-.For example, a free form (or the 'whole' in whole-
part relationships), such as kwe 'tree', in (224), can be replaced by the non-
                                   as seen in (225). (See 3.2.3 for further
human possessive pronoun prefix, i-,
discussion about the i- prefix.)


(224)   Ji       yo     kwe-muk      e     kwe-guk.
        1SG      gather tree-trunk   and tree-branch
        'I gathered up the trunks and branches.'

(225)   Ji      YO       i-muk     e     i-guk.
        ISG      gather its-trunk and its-branch
        'I gathered up the trunks and branches.'

However for body parts the possessum is an unbound form. The i- prefix is not
used with this type of construction when the possessor is elided. So when,
say, an arm is referred to on subsequent occasions the free form of the
possessum is sufficient, ellipsis of the possessor is acceptable, as seen in



(226)   Men sorom men syim.            Men sorom syim mo nu.
        IPL   shake IPL   hand         IPL    shake hands LOC house
        'We shook hands. We shook hands in the house.'

Both body parts and whole-part relationships can be combined as in (227) and
(228). In the latter case, the nails belong to the fingers which belong to the arm
(whole-part relationships) and the arm belongs to him (body part relationship).


(227)   Ptisila sap Moses syim-brot toko re.
        Prisila cut     Moses arm-vein         apart PERF
        'Prisila had cut Moses' veins in his arm apart.'

(228)   a. Yen        gwat an    syim-sopkwa-bris.
           ~ I N D E Fcut  ~ S G arm-finger-nail
           'They cut his fingernails.'

        b. Yen        gwat an    syim    sopkwa    bris.
           ~ I N D E Fcut  ~ S G arm     finger    nail
           'They cut his fingernails.'
/I   above, where each item is treated as a separate word and, in this case, sopkwa
     bris is an inalienable posessive phrase which is juxtaposed to and modifies
I


I
     another inalienable possessive phrase, an syim.



     5.3.2 Alienable possession

     Abun alienable possessive phrases consists of:


     This structure is used for all possessive phrases, except for those discussed
     above. The possessor noun phrase is commonly realised as a pronoun (229),
     proper name (230), and may also be a longer noun phrase (231).               The
     possessum is a noun phrase which is commonly realised by a single noun
     (230) or may be a longer expression (232).


     (229)   An     bi       nggon jam       nde   to.
             3sG POSS wife            know   NEG   INCOMPL
             'His wife didn't know yet.'

     (230)   Andar bi       im      ma.
             Andar poss mother come
             'Andar's mother came.'

     (231) Yetu     ge     dik yo       bi nu anane.
             person CLASS one DET POSS house DEM
             'This is someone's house.'

     (232)   Ji     mu mo ji            bi     nggwe jamsem        nim    ne.
             ISG    go     LOC   ~ S G POSS    garden cassava      east   DET
             'I went to my eastern cassava garden.'

     The linker, bi, is a free morpheme. Sometimes the possessor can be elided
     from the linker, as in (233). Sometimes the possessum can also be elided from
     the linker, as in (234). It is also possible for both possessor and possessum to
     be elided, as in (235), leaving the linker stand on its own. In all cases this may

     only occur when the possessor and possessum are recoverable from the

        context.     For example, in (235), it is known that the possessum is a wife
        because that was the topic of discussion.

             callous.'

                'If you are going to marry yours (wife), or Moses marry his (wife), then
                take good care (of them).'

        The Abun possessive phrase construction influences the way Abun speakers
        construct their lndonesian. Instead of using standard lndonesian, rumah saya
        'my house', they say saya punya rumah as in (236). The word punya means 'to
        have, possess' in lndonesian, however standard lndonesian does not employ
        'have' in posszssive phrase constructions.

                Indonesian:
        (236)   Saya punya rumah roboh.
                ISG   POSS house       faIlen.down
                'My house has fallen down.'

        Alienable possessive phrases may be intensified by the addition of i. In this
        case the form would be:




I
I
I
        This particle changes the intensity of possession in a similar way to the
        English, 'his own house', as distinct from 'his house'. The following examples
        illustrate this type of phrase:
                                                                                 Abun phrase structure 118

         ISG   POSS     house          INTENSE
         'my own house'

        ~ s G POSS          land   INTENSE
        'his own land'

This type of construction is further used to distinguish two different ownerships
in contrast to each other, as in the following:


(239)   Ji bi        bur i         anare,     nan bi       bur i                            anatu.

         the there)
        'This is my own land here, that is your own land there.'

(240)   Yewon         bi       sukduno      i             tara              re

        Yefun        bi       sukduno      i            tara          re.
        God          POSS     TEACHING     intense      different     PERF

        'The shaman's own teachings are different to God's own teachings.'


5.3.3 Recursive possessive phrases

Possessive phrases may be embedded within one another, for alienable
possession, by the addition of the linker and the possessum, as in (241) and
(242), or for inalienable possession, by the addition of the possessum, as in




(241)   Rahel bi          ai     bi             nyom
        Rachel poss father poss                 machete
        'Rachel's father's machete'

(242)   An      bi      nji       bi            nggon     bi          nu
        ~ S G POSS      brother poss            wife      poss        house
        'His brother's wife's house'

(243)   Rahel bi          ai    sy im
        Rachel poss father arm
        'Rachel's father's arm'
                                                                    Abun $bases!ructure 119




5.4 Prepositional phrases

Prepositional phrases consist of a noun phrase preceded by a preposition.
Prepositional phrases fill dative, locative, instrumental and other adjunct
positions in the sentence. In table 5.4 is a list of the prepositions used in Abun
with their English equivalent, and categorised into four different general types
This is table 3.7 repeated here for convenience.


A general feature of prepositional phrases that will be illustrated below is the
possibility of ellipsis of the head of the phrase, leaving the preposition stand
alone. In such cases the head is readily recoverable from the context.




    Preposition       English                         Preposition Type
     islnai           'to'                            dative
   - mo               'at/ to'                        spacio-temporal
    subotlbot         'about/alongl
    kagitlkadit       'from'
    karowa            'near'
    ket               'across1 at (non-locative)' .
    wadelkom mo untillfor
    su          'with'                                associative, instrumental,
                                                      temporal
   ,
    wa                'for'                           benefactive/purposive


The prepositions in these phrases differ from the linker bi used in possessive
phrases because bi only links two noun phrases whereas this group of
prepositions is used for verb (predicate)-argument             NP   relations.     Each
preposition will be discussed in turn.
                                                                          Abun phrase structure 120




     5.4.1 Dative phrases
I
'I   A phrase filling the dative function is a prepositional phrase with either is or nai
     as the preposition. These two prepositions are dialectal variants, is is used in
     Abun Ji and nai is used in Abun Ye and Abun Tat. This prepositional phrase
     type is distinguished from other types because Abun speakers strongly prefer
     to place it directly following the object of the sentence.


     As with all prepositional phrases, the preposition precedes a noun phrase such
     as a possessive phrase (244), a noun phrase (245), or the ellipsis thereof



     (244)   a. Nggon       ne     syo suk-ne        nai an        bi            im.
                girl        DEM    give NOM-DEM to           ~ S G POSS          mother
                'That girl gave those things to her mother.'

             b. Nggon       ne    syo suk-ne         is an          bi        im.
                girl        DEM give NOM-DEM to           ~ S     G POSS      mother
                'That girl gave those things to her mother.'

     (245)   Ji     nuk       suk-mwa         ne     is pa        wok      ne.
             I S G speak      thing-many DET to child             small    DET
             'I told all those things to the small child.'

     (246)   Pa    bi       im        syo     syur     is     da      nde.
             child POSS mother give           water to        drink NEG
             'The child's mother must not give water to (the child) to drink.'


     5.4.2 Spacio-temporal phrases

     A group of phrases with the prepositions mo, bot, kagit, karowa, ket and wade
     generally have locative, directional or temporal notions.               Locative (mo)
     prepositional phrases are by far the most common type, and they differ
     structurally to the other types in this category. Again, each spacio-temporal
     prepositional phrase consists of a preposition followed by a noun phrase. Of
     the several prepositions listed in the table above under this type, each will be
     discussed in turn below. Firstly,
                                                                 Abun phrase structure 121




is the general locative preposition meaning 'in, at, to', as seen in the examples
below:

(247)    Ye     mu nai su-git           mo nggwe.
        people go       get Nomeat LOC garden
        'They went to get food at the garden.'

(248)   Men mu mo Filipus bi                nu.
        IPLgo        LOC Filipus POSS       house
        'We went to Filipus' house.'

Several locative prepositional phrases may occur together such as in (249).
Both mo and bot have a tendency for recursiveness. The limitations to the
number of phrases appear to be pragmatic.


(249)    Yen faru               mu mo nje          mo nden mo            Syubun.
        people send.message go LOC people LOC bush LOC                   Syubun
        'They sent a message to the people in the bush at Syubun.'

Mo is a general locative preposition, and when a more specific location, such
as 'in front of, 'next to', or 'behind' is intended, another locative word further
specifies the location.        Such modifications are only found in locative
prepositional phrases where the preposition is mo. For example:


                 mo nu mit          'inside the house'
                 mo nu gif          'in front of the house'
                 mo nu yu           'on top of the house'
                 mo nu ke           'at the base of the house'
                 mo nu ndet         'in between the houses'
                 mo nu nim          'above the house'
                 mo banbo nim       'eastern mountain'
                 mo nu de           'at the side of the house
                 mo nu de ju        'upstream side of the house
                 mo nu de fi        'sea side of the house
I
                                                                     Abun phrase structure 122



                    mo nu de dari       'behind the house
                    rno nu de rut       'at the back of the house'
                    mo nu des nak       'underneath the house
                    mo nu de nden       'outside the house


    These locative words which follow the head of a locative phrase could be
    described as 'relator nouns'. They can become the head of the phrase when
    the actual head of the phrase is elided, such as, mo mit 'inside (the house)', mo
    nden 'outside (the house)'.


    Many of the relator nouns are preceded by de 'side' as can be seen in the list
    above. So the form of the locative prepositional phrase may be further defined
    as: mo + NP, where an additional modifier, a relator noun or [de + relator noun]
    can be included preceding the determiner and following other modifiers in the
    noun phrase., such as in (250a) and (251a).


    When the same directional word or relator noun follows the determiner of the
    phrase the meaning is different. Compare (250a) with (250b), and (251a) with
    (251b).    In the latter cases the directional word is now outside of the
    prepositional phrase. When it is within the prepositional phrase (which has its
    boundary delineated by the determiner) it modifies the head of the phrase .


    (250)   a. mo    banbo      sye nim ne
              LOC mountain big       east DET
              'on the big eastern mountain'

            b. mo    banbo     sye ne nim.
              LOC    mountainbig DET east
              'on the big mountain in the easterly direction'
    (251)a. mo       Nyanvon bi         nu     de     ju         ne
              LOC    Nyarwon poss house side            upstream DET
              'on the upstream side of Nyarwon's house'
    I                                                                      Abun phrase structure 123



!

                b. mo       Nyanvon bi         nu     ne       de ju
                     LOC Nyawon        POSS house DET          side upstream
                     'at Nyarwon's house, upstream side'

        Recursive prepositional phrases may also include relator words, for example,:


        (252)   mo      nggwe mo banbo            tatu   nim
                LOC garden LOC mountain distant east
                'at the garden on the distant eastern mountain'

        (253)   mo      nggwe mor6 ju
                LOC garden close upstream
                'at the nearby upstream garden'

        More than one relator noun in either order (yo nim or nim yu) can modify the
        noun head of a phrase, for example:


        (254) a.     mo     banbo      yu     nirn ne
                     LOC mountain top         east DET
                     'on the top of the eastern mountain'

                b. mo       banbo       nirn yu ne
                     LOC mountain east top DET
                     'on the top of the eastern mountain'




        Bot which is a shortening of subot, introduces a phrase which could be
        described as perlative in meaning, that is, 'about, along or through'. Bot is
        preferred in fast speech.        The following examples illustrate this type of
        prepositional phrase. Bot has undergone a process of grammaticalisation to
        become a suffix on some verbs, as discussed in 3.3.1.


        (255) Pa            siker nok        bot kwa-yo-kwa-yo.
                young.man tease wild-pig about thing-a-thing-a
                'The young men teased the wild pig about many things.'

        (256)An       mu subot yen ne             ket         ya     ne.
                ~ S G 90     along sand DET west              flat   DET
                'He went along the sand in a westerly direction on the flat part.'
                                                                      Abun phrase structure 124




    This type of prepositional phrase can be recursive, (257). Speakers have a
    strong preference for bot phrases to precede mo phrases, as seen in (258),
!
'
    and, when the noun phrase is recoverable from the context, ellipsis of the
    phrase itself is possible, leaving only the preposition (259).


    (257) An saye bot nu        bof   nden    nu    de ne                    ju.
              shout about house about outside house side DET
          3 s ~                                                               upstream
            'She shouted (for me) about the houses, about the outside of the houses
            just up to the upstream side (of the village).' or 'She shouted out (for me)
            outside each house on the upstream side (of the village)'

    (258)   An     gu bot         rus        mo kampung      ne.
            3 s ~kill about family LOC village               DET
            'She killed all the families in the village.'

    (259) Nggon mise syun ma           bot.
            woman evil chase come about
            'The evil woman chased after (them).'


    kagitlkadit

    Here again is a dialect variation, kadit and kagit are identical in meaning and
    use. This preposition has several shades of meaning. The basic meaning is
    'from', and this can be from a location (260), a situation (261), or a point in time



    (260) An     ma     kagit Filipus bi    nu.
            3s come from Filipus POSS house
            'He came from Filipus's house.'

    (261) An      ge     kadit an       bi    suki  ne.
            ~ S Ghealed from     3 s ~Poss sickness DET
            'He is healed from the sickness.'

    (262)   Ji     ben kadit ketke              sor    kom       mo-re.
            ISG do from beginning only until LOC-here
            'I have just done (that) all the time up until now.'
                                                               Abun phrase structure 125




The preposition karowa means 'near, close to', and may also be used as an
adverb. Its main use is locative (263) and (264a)' but it is also used in a
temporal sense (265). In some contexts the head of the phrase can be elided,
leaving the preposition stand alone (264b).


(263)   Men mu mo os            mit     karowa nu-ari            Ebenezer.
        ~ P L go LOC road middle near            house-Sunday Ebenezer

        'Close to sunset, ....'

ket

The form ket is another locative preposition. It precedes the location of the
path of the action. For example, the location of the path where goods were
being carried in (266) is along the ground, that is, by foot, and the location of
the path of the movement in (267) was towards the interior (rather than the
sea). The preposition undergoes grammaticalisation to become a suffix on
some verbs which is discussed in 3.3.1.


(266)   Men    Sam suk ket           bur.
        1PL    carry things LOC earth
        'We carried the things, walking along.

(267)   Men     tot   ket nden.
         1PL    cut   LOC     interior
        'We cut across to the interior (path).'
                                                                    Abun phrase structure 126



(268)   Pa      mu ket os           kwa    syu ne.
        child go      LOc path the.one long DET
        'The child went on the long path.'

(269)   Ji       ben ket ji        i.
        ISGdo          LOC    ISG  desires
        'I did (things) according to my desires.'




Another type of spacio-temporal prepositional phrase is formed with the
preposition waddkom mo 'untilifor'.                 These    two forms       are     used
interchangeably, for example,


(270)a. Men kem           mone wade kam-gwe rek.
             IPL   live there for          day-two full
             'We stayed there for two full days.'

        b. Men kem mone kom mo kam-gwe rek.
           IPLlive there until           LOC    day-two full
           'We stayed there for two full days.'

(271)   An gwat su kre                r    mu wade noru mit             jam musi
        ~ S G take with afternoon this go until night middle hour nine
        'He took it from this afternoon until the middle of the night, nine o'clock.'


5.4.3 Associative phrases

The preposition used for associative as well as instrumental and temporal
prepositional phrases is su. Su is mainly used in prepositional phrases that
mean association. The examples below illustrate an 'association' with humans
(272) and (273), and also things, such as those in the canoe with lsak in (274).


(272)   Nan Sam kwem su                 Isak.
        ~ S G carry canoe with          lsak
        'Carry the canoe with Isak.'

(273)   An       grem pa        su    an      bi im.
        ~ S G put       child with 3 s ~ PoSs mother
        'She left the child with her mother.'
                                                                         Abun phrase structure 127




I   (274)   lsak
            lsak
                    mbros kwem su
                    row     canoe with
                                              suk     e     bukur
                                              things and bowls
                                                                          e
                                                                          and
                                                                                  ne.
                                                                                  DET
            'Isak rowed the boat with things, bowls and so on.'


I   Furthermore the preposition can by itself act as a proforrn for the whole phrase

/   in cases where, from the context, the contents of the phrase are known. In the
    example below the speaker was talking about his wife's sickness and how it
    necessitated the construction of a house in the bush. So he built the house
    'with that situation in mind', and only requires the preposition su to
    communicate that. There is no need for a pause or any other phonological
    device to signify this phrase. Another phrase beginning with the preposition,
    mo, makes it clear that the so phrase has been completed.


    (275)   Ji         go    nu     wok su         mo nden ne.
            ISG        build house small with LOC bush DET
            'I built a small house (with that situation in mind) in the bush.'

    Examples of phrases where su has an instrumental meaning are:

    (276)   Alfon gwa Simon su             kwe koi      sye.
            Alfon hit     Simon with wood piece big
            'Alfon hit Simon with a big piece of wood.'

    (277)   Ji      kon an        gwes su      weu   gan.
            ISG     cook 3 s ~ leg with banana young
            'I treated his leg with a young banana.'

    (278)   An go Musa su             an bi       im      bi nggarmom muk.
            3 s ~kill Musa with 3 s ~     poss mother Poss iron       pipe
            'He killed Musa with his mother's iron pipe.'

    In context all but the preposition in a prepositional phrase may be elided. This

    is a common feature for all prepositional phrases. Thus in a discussion about

    going to get a young banana tree, and bring it back home to prepare a
    treatment, one could then say,


    (279)   Be       ji       kon an         gwes su.
            later     ISG     cook 3 s ~ leg with
            'Later I will treat his leg with (it).'
1   The use of su can also include temporal ideas, the phrase, 'with the cool sun'
I


    means 'in the late afternoon'. They may be sentence initial as in (280), or part
    of the predicate following the verb as in (281) and (282)' while (283) shows
    how the preposition itself may be sufficient where the phrase is elided.


    (280) SU         futmo ne       an    kra    su     Lamber.
            with     first   DET ~ S G marry with       Lamber
            'In the 6nt place, she married Lamber.'

    (281)Prisila ti     su     now ne          mu mo           an   bi     im.
         Prisila flee with night DET go              LOC       3%   POSS   mother
        'Prisila fled atlduring the night to her mother.'

    (282)   Men ne syesyar         su      tahun musyu          moM
            IPLDFT came.out with           year ten             seven
            'We came out in (19)70.'

    (283)    Tahun ne      anab          men syesyar        SU.
            year    DET the.one.which ~ P L came.out        with
            'That was the year in which we cane out from the jungle.'

    Su, which has an associative notion, can be replaced with si, which is used for
    coordination of noun phrases, as discussed below in 5.7.1.              On some
    occasions, Abun speakers split coordinate noun phrases, like (284a) around
    the verb. When that occurs si acts like a preposition equivalent to su, as in
    (284b). In such a case su would also be acceptable, as seen in (284~).There
    is a progression from closer coordination to looser coordination of the
    participants from (284a) to (284~). When a coordinate noun phrase is not split
    around the verb, su cannot replace si, as in (284d). Usually coordinate noun
    phrases are not split. On more than 90% of the occurrences in the data,
    speakers do not split coordinate noun phrases, instead they prefer to keep
    them together, as in (284a). rather than split as in (284b).


    (284) a.   Apner si        Fredik si     Musa      git      sugit.
               Apner with Fredik with Musa             eat      food
               'Apner, Fredik and Musa ate food (together).'
                                                                    Abun phrase structure 129

        c. Apner git       sugit su      Fredik su         Musa.
           Apner eat food with Fredik with                 Musa

5.4.4 Benefactive phrases

The benefactivelpurposive phrase has the preposition wa 'for'. This preposition
has undergone a process of grammaticalisation as discussed in 3.3.1.                     Its
common use is in benefactive prepositional phrases, for example,


(285)    Ye     fro      suk       wa    men ka            gri.
        people prepare things for        ~ P L CLASS       three
        'They prepared things for us three.'

(286)   Ji       kon wa ji          bi   nu    ne        sor.
        1SG       COO^ for    ~ S G POSS house DET       only
        'I only cook for my household.'

(287)   Sugane       ye       mu wa kam sye mo Uigwem.
        at.that.time people go for         day big LOC Uigwem
        'At that time they went for the celebrations at Uigwem.'

The preposition, wa, is also a conjunction. In the following example, the first
wa is a purpose conjunction and the second a benefactivelpurpose preposition.


(288)An       ben mbros wa an              mu wa Isak.
        ~ S G do    oar      for   ~ S G go       for    lsak
        'He made an oar so he could go for (to help) Isak.'


5.5 Adverbial and adjectival phrases

Adverbial phrases in Abun consist of:
                                                                  Abun phrase stnrdure 130




                              ADJECTIVE + (INTENSIFIER).




I
    Usually the optional intensifier is absent, leaving a single adjective as head of
    the phrase.
                                                                    Abun phrase structure 131




Intensifiers used in adjectival phrases are the same as in adverbial phrases,
with the addition of ye 'very' and ndo nde 'good NEG: very (with negative
connotations)' as seen in the examples below. For extra intensification ye may

occur with ndo nde, as in (292b).


(291)   a. Ndar sye wai           ma     jau ji.
           dog big INTENSE come bite 1sG
           'A very big dog (bigger than normal) came and bit me.'

        b. Ndar sye teker        ma    jau ji.
           dog big INTENSE come bite 1SG
           'An extremely big dog came and bit me.'

        c. Ndar sye ye           ma      jau    ji.
           dog big INTENSE come bite              1sG
           'A very big dog came and bit me.'

        d. Ndar sye ndo nde ma              jau       ji.
           dog big good NEG come bite                  ISG
           'A very big dog came and bit me.'

(292)    a. sugit mo         nu         safe       sugum      sye       ndo        nde
            food LOC          house like.that money           big       good       NEG
            in a restaurant like that the food is very expensive'

         b. sugit mo      nu       sare      sugum       sye ye      ndo           nde
            food LOC house like.that money               big very good             NEG
            in a restaurant like that the food is very, very expensive'

The intensifier ye differs from wai in that ye does not convey any comparative
notions as wai does.


The general quantifier mwa 'many' may also be intensified in the same way as
both adjectives and adverbs, as the following examples show.


(293)a. yetu   mwa teker
        people many INTENSE
        'too many people'

        b. yetu    mwa wai
           people many INTENSE
           'very many people'
                                                                            Aknphrase structure 132



(294)   Nggon ne       ben sin'     mws      ye.
        woman DET      do    wrong many very
        'The woman has done many many wrong things.'

(295)   Nggon ne ben sin          su     ye     mwa ye        ndo                           nde.
        woman DET do      wrong with people many very good                                  NEG
        'The woman has done wrong things with many, many people.'


5.6 Quantifier phrases

A quantifier phrase consists of:

                              (CLASSIFIER*) QUANTIFIER

                     (I'a classifier is obligatory for cardinal numerals)



A classilier indicates something about the shape or size of an object that is
head of a noun phrase in the same way as lmves in the English, "threeloeves
of bread. There are many types of classifiers that may be used depending
upon the type of noun in the phrase head, such as ge for persons or animals,
gwes for long items, such as pieces of bamboo. In 3.4.1, table 3.9 lists each
classifier and the types of nouns to which they apply.


General quantifiers are mwa 'many', bok 'several' and de 'somelpart'. With
more commonly used nouns, classifiers have a greater tendency to be absent.
Some examples are:


(296)   yenggras (ge)         bok       ne
        old.men      CLASS    several DET
        'the several old respected men'

(297)   yenggras (ge)        mwa     ne
        old.men     CLASS    many    DET
        'the many old respected men'

1298)   Men git     weu       (bo)    de yo.
        ~ P L eat   banana CLASS some DET
        'We ate some of the bananas.'
                                                              Abun phrase structure 133       I
                                                                                              !
                                                                                              I




(299)   Minda kn         (ge)      mwa ok       kadit pe     ne.
        butterfly yellow CIASS many fly         from place DET
        'Many yellow butterflies flew away from that place.'

(300)   An     nai jamsem (is)         mwa.
        ~ S G get   cassava CLASS      many
        'He took many cassava.'

Ordinal numerals which may be head of a quantifier phrase are formed by a
combination of do 'the one which' and each numeral, except for do-ketke 'first',              I
or the dialectal variant, do-fufmo 'first'. Every other ordinal numeral is formed
by combining do and the appropriate cardinal numeral. A classifier is optional
with these. Some examples are:

(301)   warn do-ketke
        time      the.one which-one
        'first time'

(302)   nu      gwes kok kwaf              do-gri
        house leg       high platform the.one which-three
        'the house on stilts' third level'

(303)An git      weu       (bo)    do-at.
    3 s ~eat banana CLASS the.one.which-four
    'He is eating the fourth banana.'

Cardinal numerals may also be head of a quantifier phrase.             Classifiers,
however, are obligatory when a cardinal numeral is used, except for a few
                                                                                          I
common cases such as an (ge) we 'they two', where the classifiers are                     I
                                                                                          i
sometimes elided due to common usage.          Some examples of the use of
                                                                                          i
                                                                                          t

numerals is found in 3.4.1.

5.7 Complex phrases

Complex phrases consist of two basic types, coordination and apposition.


Regarding the first of these, coordination, all languages possess strategies that
permit various types of coordination to occur at the phrasal and sentential level,
thereby forming complex phrases and sentences.              According to Payne
(1985b:3) there are "five basic co-ordination types which are realised
linguistically both at phrasal and sentential levels: conjunction (p and q),
postsection (p and not q), presection (not p and q), disjunction (p or q) and
rejection (not p and not q; not... p or q)."


Payne (1985b:3) claims that most languages treat postsection, presection and
rejection analytically as a combination of conjunction and negation, or
disjunction and negation, that is, there is no distinct synthetic form. Abun also
treats these three types of coordination analytically. Therefore only conjunction
and disjunction are distinct categories in Abun.


The second basic type of complex phrase is that of apposition. Since this is
structurally the same as one type of coordination (simple juxtaposition) it will be
                                                                                            ,
discussed under that section.


The table below summarises each complex noun phrase type and structure that
will be discussed below.

5.7.1 Conjunction

There are five different strategies used to conjoin phrases and sentences listed
by Payne (1985b:25-37) consisting of the use of simple juxtaposition (he calls
the 'zero' strategy), 'and', 'with', 'pronoun' and 'dual' strategies. Abun employs
the first three types of strategies to conjoin phrases and sentences.


In simple juxtaposition, there are no markers of conjunction. It is a normal
alternative existing alongside other strategies. This strategy is permitted at all
levels from sentence to noun phrase, as well as in verb phrases (verb phrases,
incidentally, only allow this type of strategy to give what appear to be serial
verb formations). Examples are:



     people hit.with.instr people hit.with.hand ~ S G
     'They were hitting with a stick and (they were) punching him.'
Prepositional Phrase:
             ma kagit Pef kagit Bamogwem                 kagit     Bikar.
     people come from Pef from      Bamogwem             from      Bikar
     'They came from Pef, Bamogwem and Bikar.'
Noun Phrase:

Apposition, where the two heads involved stand in a mutually attributive
                                                                                                  I
relationship, (that is, each head is at the same time an attribute of the other
head), is a special case of this unmarked type of coordination. Alternatively,
                                                                                                  i
when the heads are single nouns, as in (313) and (314), they may be analysed
                                                                                                  I
as a single noun phrase, as discussed in 5.2.1 above. Thus an apposition
                                                                                                  I
noun phrase in Abun has the structure of NP + NP. TWOor more noun phrases
are juxtaposed. For example,
                                                                                                  I
(313)   Men ye-nden         git    nggruk          nde.
        IPL    PERS-bush eat turtle NEG
        'We, "Bush" people must not eat turtle.'

(314)    Ye      ne     ye-su-go-te          ye-Waropen.
        person DET PERS-head-hair-blackPERS-Waropen
        'That person is a Papuan, a Waropen.'

(315)Ji      bi     nji       ye-guru       mo nden        kwop     re.
        ISG  POSS brother PERS-teacherLOC bush             die      PERF
        'My brother, the inland teacher has died.'

With recursive apposition, the head of the noun phrase is repeated, as in (316).
By way of contrast, in the case where a subsequent noun phrase modifies the
first using the noun modifying particle, to. the head of the phrase is not
repeated, as in (317).

                                                                                              F

     In the 'and' sfretegy, the coordinating particle, e is used as a conjunction in
     sentences and phrases. In the case of noun phrases the form is:



     There is no distinction in meaning between the use of this particle and simple
     juxtaposition.       Therefore examples are found in sentences, prepositional
     phrases and noun phrases similar to those given above. In all cases e may be
     added between the noun phrases, but not for verb phrases. This particle is
     widely used and conjoins phrases in subject positions (318)' or object
     positions (319) in Abun sentences. Topicalised objects may also include
     complex phrases conjoined by e (320).


     (318) Abi        e   Arun e         Joni e         nin     grr,   mut et.
             mother and Arun and Joni and               ~ P L   eye    close MHORT
             'Mum, Arun and Joni, close your eyes.'

     (319)   Nin we git suge sato nok          e   be       e   ron
             ~ P Ltwo eat animal like wimld.pigand kangaroo and treekangaroo
             e      ne.
             and    det
             'Eat animals such as wild pigs, kangaroos, tree kangaroos and the like.'

     (320) Mbos       e   ndabu e      ndem ga sye ne e                an fowa       sino.

             'Pigeons, doves and birds that are big, they are all forbidden (for women
             to eat) .'

     The 'with' strategy is widely used to conjoin noun phrases. It is rarely used in
     sentences, and is not permitted in prepositional phrase constructions. Payne
     points out that this is a very common strategy and that usually the coordinating
     particle is identical to the adposition marking the associative sense of 'with'
     (1985b:29). This is not quite true for Abun, where the coordinating particle is si
     'with', while the associative preposition is su 'vith', the two forms nevertheless
'i
i    appearing cognate.

(324) Apner git      sugit si     Fredik si      Musa.
        Apner eat food with Fredik with Musa
        'Apner ate food together with Fredik and Musa.'

The 'with' strategy is not only used for joining phrases where the head is a
name or a pronoun, but also where the head is another type of noun, a noun
phrase or a possessive phrase, such as in the following examples:


(325) Suk        sat0    sukom       si     bok si        barisyan an git sore.
        things like      vegetables with salt with chili             ~ P Leat only
        'Only things like vegetables with salt and with chili they can eat.'

(326) Men     kadum      Syunsom s i    ef      Urn.
        IPL   pointout Syunsom with island Um
        'We pointed out Syumsom and Um island.'
(327)   Rahel si bi         im      si     bi     al    mu re.
        Rachel with Poss mother with poss father go PERF
        'Rachel and her mother and father had Aready gone.'

The 'with' strategy is limited to the conjoining of noun phrases, and in some
rare cases, in the joining of clauses with a common subject. The following
example, where two clauses are joined, comes from a text where the speaker is
giving advice on what children with diarrhea should not do.


(328)   Pa     da     gur      bo     dek     rom        si gif i-ka       nde
        child drink coconut cuss young liquid with eat its-flesh NEG
        'Children must not drink young coconut milk together with eating its flesh.'
        or 'Don't drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh.'

There appears to be no limit as to how many phrases can be joined by si 'with'
(or e 'and'). One recorded example has a list of nine places that lsak pointed
out to the author of the story, lsak kadum Jokya, Syugai, Syurgwem, Syukwo,
Somsibo, Weyos, Bangkui, Bangkwau si Wai is ji.           This utterance used the
pause much like English and concluded with si 'with' before the final place
name.
                                                               Abun phrase structure 140




The use of the 'with' strategy is more common with coordinate phrases in
subject position. This is due to the fact that subjects are mostly agents. On the
other hand, use of e is more common with coordinate phrases in object
position, although there are exceptions as seen in (318).


Semantically there are some restrictions on the use of the 'with' strategy. The

conjuncts must be seen as acting together, as in (327), Rachel and her parents
went together.       If they went separately, the speaker would use the 'and'
strategy. Also, to employ the 'with' strategy, the conjuncts could be seen as
being located close together. Thus in (326), the island and Syunsom were
seen together, or pointed out together, and so si was used. Also in (325), the
items spoken about are of the same type in the sense that vegetables are
eaten together with either or both of salt and chili. If, however, these items
were in a list and not necessarily eaten together then e would be used, as in
(319), where different food items that would not be eaten together are listed.



There are times when si must be used and not e. In (329) the use of si means
that the clothes mentioned are actually in the bags.        If the clothes were
separate from the bags then e would be more appropriate than si. The use of si
therefore implies a togetherness much more so than the use of e.


(329) Pa     pe     yu     si    san         e     sukmwa        ne.
     child carry bag with clothes and many.things DET
     'The children carried the bags with clothes and the many (other) things.'

In (330), for example, Apner, Markus and RK are not together when the

speaker refers to them. They are in different locations and are being spoken
about at different points in time. Therefore since there is no 'togetherness' e is

rr~oreappropriate.
                                                                Abun phrase structure 141

     3 s ~spoke.about Apner and Markus                 and     RK       and.
     'She spoke about Apner, Markus and RK.'

In summary, of the three strategies used for conjunction, namely, juxtaposition,
                                                                                                ,
'and' and 'with', there is a strengthening of coordination from one to the next,                iI

that is, the first is more a general grouping of items, while the last is more a
specific linking of items.


                                                                                                I
5.7.2 Disjunction                                                                               1


According to Payne (1985b:40) the majority of languages appear to possess at
least one unequivocal strategy for disjunction, and this is invariably permitted at
sentential and phrasal levels. This is true in Abun. The basic structure for
disjunction is for the speaker to follow each phrase or sentence with the word,
bado. In Abun disjunct phrases consist of: NP bad0 NP bad0 and so on. The
form, bado is the alternative conjunction.


Examples of the use of bado from sentence to phrase level are:
Sentence:
(331) Pa   yo ki   nai bado Ester mu mo Barbarina ete        ma bad0...
     child DET say to or     Ester go LOC Barbarina and.then come or...

         handspan four or.

         'Erensi took the foba cloth, (it was) two or three or four handspans.'

    Payne (1985b:40) also points out that in certain environments the distinction
    between 'and' and 'or' (when the latter is indifferent in the choice between the
    elements), may be a minimal one. For example, in (319) above, an alternative
    translation would be, "Eat animals such as wild pigs (or), kangaroos (or), tree
    kangaroos or the like.' Likewise there is some merging of 'and' and 'or' in
    examples (310) and (320). On the other hand, examples (318) and (330) may
    not be translated as 'or', but must only be 'and'.


    Juxtaposition is sometimes used as an alternative to bado. It is particularly
    evident when quantifiers are used in noun phrases, such as (336).

    (336) mbre    dik   yo      we     yo
         cloth one a            two    a
         'one or two cloths'

    Other alternatives to bado that are frequently used as alternative conjunctions
    in spoken Abun are ke and ka.           These come from Biak and lndonesian
    respectively, the latter being a corruption of the yes-no question particle, kah.
    This has come about because bad0 is used in asking alternative or tag
    questions as in, An ma, bado, (nde e)?"He has come or (not)?' Frequently
    nde e is omitted, so the alternative conjunction may also act like a yes-no
    interrogative particle. Thus Abun speakers have adopted the lndonesian kah
    and use that just like they use their own bado, that is, as an alternative
                                                                     Abun phrase stnrdure 143




    conjunction and in alternative questions, even though in lndonesian kah is only

i
I
      yes-no question marker, and not an alternative conjunction. The alternative
I
    conjunction in lndonesian is atau, which also is sometimes borrowed by Abun
    speakers. Examples are:

    (337)   Nan kra bi         ka Moses kra bi           ka Set kra bi          ka
            ~ S Gmarry poss or Moses marry poss or Set marry poss or
            'If you marry yours, or Moses marries his, or Set marries his, ...'

    (338)   Men mu mo Resye ke Syukwor tuya              ke Uigwem tuya ke.
            IPL go LOC Resye or Syukwor (distant) or Uigwem (distant) or.
            'We will go to Resye or distant Syukwor or distant Uigwem.'
6. Marked moods

There are three moods which are marked in Abun, namely, interrogative,
imperative and frustrated action. Mood is marked by a clause final particle
which follows other particles (that is, those that mark negation, aspect and
modality). Each marked mood will be discussed in turn.



6.1 Interrogative mood

lnterrogative mood, like other moods in Abun, uses particles. Two particles are
used to bracket or delineate the constituent being interrogated. The pattern of
bracketing a grammatical constituent by particles is a feature of the Abun
language. It is used in negation (see 8.2),and also in relative clauses, both
restricted and unrestricted as discussed by C. Berry (1995).


The basic structure of an interrogative sentence in Abun is:

                               IQM   clause FQM

The optional particle, te, (referred to as IQM 'Initial Question Marker') and
another particle called FQM 'Final Question Marker' bracket the clause in
question. For all question types     fe is the   IQM,   but the particle, FQM, varies
according to the type of question being asked.


The initial particle, te, although now apparently totally optional, may well have
been an obligatory part of interrogative structures in the past, before the
influence of the national language, Indonesian. This is born out by the fact that
those less influenced by the national language from interior villages use te
much more than those on the coast, where the effects of the national language
are more prevalent.
                                                                  Abun marked moods 145




As a general rule, the pattern of intonation in interrogative sentences is a final
falling contour. The exception is confirmative questions which have a final
rising intonation.


All interrogatives are seeking some type of information, and on lexical grounds,
namely the variation in the FQM particle, it is apparent that Abun has four basic
types of interrogatives. The four types are the:

*   YES-NO  (or NEXUS)question, one that seeks a comment on the truth of a
    proposition.

*   CONFIRMATIVE     question, that seeks agreement, or confirmation from the
    addressee.

*   ALTERNATIVE question, which provide a list of possibilities from which the
    addressee selects an answer.

*   INFORMATION  or QUESTION WORD question which seeks particular information
    such as 'who', 'what', 'how', 'why', 'when' and 'where'.

A summary of Abun question types, their structure and related final intonation
pattern is contained in the following table. Each type will be discussed in turn
below.

                                                                 Abun marked moods 146




6.1.2 Yes-no questions

There are many characteristics that distinguish yes-no questions from other
structures in the world's languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock & Zwicky
(1985:181) in order of frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation
contour, a sentence initial particle, a sentence final particle, special verb
morphology and word order.       Abun yes-no questions are marked with an
optional sentence initial particle and an obigatory sentence final particle.


The structure of a YES-NO question in Abun is:

                                  (te) CLAUSE e

The 'Yes-No Question Marker', e, is always used in yes-no questions.
                                                                                         !
However, the 'Initial Question Marker', te, is always optional and more often
than not is omitted. Of those yes-no questions studied, about 35% used te.               I

                                                                                         i
Examples (339) and (340) illustrate typical yes-no questions, showing that with          iI


or without te the meaning is the same.


(339)a.      Te nan kra         it e?
                                                                                         I
                                                                                         f
                                                                                         I

             'Are you married?'

(340)   a.   Te    nan   nai nan         bi      suk    it    e?
             IQM   ~ S G get     2 s ~ Poss      things COMPL YNQM
             'Have you got your things?'

        b.   Nan   nai nan bi            suk    it    e?
             ~ S G get   ~ S G POSS      things COMPL YNQM
             'Have you got your things?'

One of the most striking characteristics of yes-no questions noted by                    t
                                                                                         q
researchers is a rising final intonation contour (Sadock 8 Zwicky 1985:181).
                                                                 Abun marked moods 147




An analysis of the intonation patterns in Abun yes-no questions reveals the
opposite, that is, a falling final intonation contour. The intonation pattern for
interrogative sentences is the same as that for indicative sentences. Therefore
intonation is not significant distinguishing feature of yes-no questions in Abun
as it is in many other languages. Ultan (1978:230)points out that in his 79
language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising
terminal contour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see
diagrams I and 2 below which contrast yes-no and confirmative question
intonation patterns).


There are three basic systems for short answers to yes-no questions, yesfno,
agreeldisagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these
systems: an echo system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde,
for negative responses. They do not have both positive and negative particles
for answering like the English 'yes' and 'no', but rather they only have the
negative particle. When a question such as (341) is asked, a positive answer
would be the echo, "There is cooked food." Frequently such answers may be
even shortened further, a possible response to (341) being mo, 'there is'. A
negative response would require the use of nde 'no'.


(341)   A     kon    suk a          YO      ]on     e?
        ~ S G cook thing PAUSE some          cooked YNQM
        'Have you cooked anything?'

Although Abun speakers use an echo system for positive responses, their body
language responses to yes-no questions uses a yes/no system. Raising of the
eyebrows means 'yes', and turning up of their nose means 'no'.
                                                              Abun marked moods 148




6.1.2 Confirmative questions

This type of question asks for confirmation of a presumed situation.         The


                                        (fe) CLAUSEfe

Such constructions are very similar to yes-no questions, but they have a rising
final intonation contour and use the marker fe 'Confirmative Question Marker,
CQM'    sentence final, as in (342) and (343).


                                suk       ane     fe?
        lQM   1SG     POSS      thing     DEM     CQM
        'That's mine! Right?'

(343) Ndo       fe?

        'That's good! Right?' or 'That's good, isn't it?'

These questions presume a positive response and may also be called
positively biased yes-no questions. Negatively biased yes-no questions, such

as in (344), are unacceptable to an Abun speaker.


(344) *Ndar   anane nde         fe?
        dog DET         NEG CQM
        'That's not a dog, right?

Confirmative questions do not only have a distinct FQM, but they are also
distinguished from yes-no questions by a rising final intonation contour.
Example (345) has the intonation pattern as shown in figure 3, which contrasts
with the intonation pattern for the yes-no question of (346) shown in figure 4

6.1.3 Alternative questions

In an alternative question two or more possibilities are presented by the
speaker. Combinations include two possibilities such as, "Do you want to go,
or not?", where the alternative is a positive or negative reply; of "Do you want a
banana, or a coconut?", where the alternative is between two items. Also more
extensive lists of alternative items are possible. as well as those where one
alternative is specified with the second alternative seeks information such as,
"IS the palm wine sweet, or what?"


For an alternative question where there are two alternatives, the structure is:

                                   (te) CUUSE bad0 CIAUSE e
                                                                 Abun marked moods 150




Example (347) illustrates two alternatives:


(347)   A     kra     Moses bad0              a    ban             e?
        ~ S G marry Moses AQM                ~ S G do.not.want     YNQM
        Do you want to marry Moses, or don't you want to?

Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have
just two alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the
first alternative (which is positive) is followed by bado, while the second
alternative is the negative particle, nde, followed by the yes-no question
marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative alternative question, is:

                             (te)c l n u s ~
                                           bad0 nde e

Example (348) illustrates this type of question.


(348) Te      men       frot    dn   bado, nde      e?
        IQM    1PL      inform ~ P L AQM   NEG      YNQM
        'Will we tell him or not?'

This form is often shortened by the ellipsis of nde e resulting in a form like that
of yes-no questions, but with a different FQM, that is, bado. Such a form, as in

(349), is still a positive-negative alternative question. It has the same meaning
as if nde e was present.


(349) A       jam    nadi, bado?
        ~ S G know pray      AQM
        'Do you know how to pray (or not)?

This type of construction could be called a truncated positive-negative
alternative question. The addition of nde e makes the question more forceful
and is used in cases where a question, like example (349), is ignored or not
answered quickly enough, so the speaker would reiterate the question with nde
e in addition to bado.
                                                                    Abun marked moods 151


I
I   A further variation of the type of alternative question is one where the final
    alternative seeks information. The final clause follows the same structure as
    information seeking questions, discussed in 6.1.4. Example (350) illustrates
    this type, where the last alternative is actually an information seeking question,
    and uses the particle, ne as FQM.


    (350) Nau          ne     wik            bad0          sa     u     ne?
         palm.wine DET        good.tasting AQM             like   which FQM
         'Does that palm wine taste good, or what?'

    Regarding intonation in alternative questions, Abun has a falling final intonation
    contour on bad0 in much the same way as intonation falls in yes-no questions
    as well as indicative sentences.


    No matter what type of alternative question is asked, the syntax is the same,
    that is the 'Alternative Question Marker' (AQM),bado, follows each alternative,
    except the last one which is followed by its relevant QM, usually the yes-no
    question marker, except for cases where the final alternative is one seeking
    information. The 'Initial Question Marker' (IQM) is optionally present, as for
    other question types. The structure of an alternative question (where n + I =
    the number of alternatives) is:

                            [(fe)CLAUSEbad0 InCMUSE e.

    In (351) there are four alternatives. Each one, except the last, is followed by
    bado. It means that the clause which precedes it is in question as a possible

    alternative and every clause in an alternative question must be followed by
    bado. The comma before bad0 and the semi-colon after it represent a pause
    and a longer pause respectively.

        on long trips too, does she carry heavy things too, or does she just stay at
        home and sweep the house?.'


6.1.4 Information seeking questions

Questions seeking information such as those asking 'who', 'what1, 'how', 'why',
'when' and 'where' are all formed in Abun in a similar way. They follow the
general bracketing pattern that is evident in negation. A question of this type is
formed by using two particles or markers, te, which is always optional at the
start of the sentence and FQM at the end. A interrogative proform is also used
in conjunction with these markers.           This is a rare combination according
Sadock & Zwicky (1985: 183)' who say that inversion and special morphology
frequently co-occur with interrogative words, whereas particles and contrastive
intonation do not.


The structure of information seeking interrogative sentences in Abun is:

                         (te)   S   V   0 ADJUNCT (Q) FQM,


where FQM 'Final Question Marker' and (o) represents a single interrogative
word which may follow one of either the subject, the verb, the object or the
adjuncts depending upon which constituent is being interrogated. Exceptions to
this pattern occur when information seeking interrogative sentences are
topicalised as in (352). This pattern is discussed in detail in 6.1.4.4.
                                                                    Abun marked moods I53



(352) Ben     sa u          anato nan yo       ma       more nde ne?

        'How is it that you didn't you come here?' or 'Why didn't you come here?'

Regarding the initial marker, te, in a sample of 194 questions in text material te

??erefore questions like (353)' without the IQM are more common than those

        1sg give what to ~ S G FQM
        'What can I give to you?' or 'How can I help you?'

The final question marker (FQM) is either ne or o. The use of either one of
these particles is obligatory. The particles ne and o are used interchangeably,
with no change in meaning. So (354a) has the same meaning as (354b) .
These h o particles appear to have been originally dialectal variants which
have now been incorporated into all dialects. There is no apparent difference
in meaning, ne is more common than o, occurring in 90% of all questions

Both particles (te ...ne/o) bracket the whole sentence irrespective of its
complexity. In a complex sentence (355)' two clauses are embedded, a relative
clause and a dependent purpose clause. Both are bracketed by the initial and

    Information seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to
    yes-no and alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be
    expected according to the findings by Ultan (1978:230), where he points out
    that information questions have a considerably better than chance probability
    of having a rising terminal contour.


    The question word follows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In
    (356), the subject, that is, 'the person who came', is the focus of interrogation,
    whereas in (357) the object, that is, 'the types of plants' is the focus of
    interrogation. In (358) the location is the focus of interrogation, and in (359)
    the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.

    With regard to the interrogative proforms used in information seeking
    questions, Abun has only three. According to Sadock 8 Zwicky (1985:184),
    theoretically it should be possible that only one single morpheme, glossed as
    'what' is needed. So then all information questions would involve periphrasis

    (i.e.'what person' for who, 'what place' for where etc.). However in practice the
    Smallest system known to them is the Yokuts system with three interrogative
    words. Abun can therefore be added as one of the smallest systems known.
    The three proforms are:
                                                                                   Abun marked moods 155

    equivalent question words in English.

Abun is even more unusual than Yokuts in that it does not have a distinct
interrogative proform that makes a distinct:-n           between personal and
impersonal ('who1, and 'what' in English). Ultan (1978:229) points out that this
contrast is almost always present. But instead Abun forms the pronominal
interrogative, 'who' by a combination of je 'person' and u 'which'.


Each interrogative word with examples of various question types is discussed
below.


6.1.#. l u questions

The most widely used interrogative word is u. It is used to form the following
types of interrogatives:


who

U forms questions inquiring about the identity of a person, who may be either
the subject, (360)' object, (361), or accompaniment, (362), in a sentence.


(360)   Je       u       ma       mo-re    ne?

        dog    DET     bite person which      FQM
        'Who did the dog bite?'

(362)   Nan kern su je          u    ne?
        2 s ~ live with person which FQM
        'Who do you live with?'

Examples (363) and (364) illustrates a questions inquiring about the
possession of a dog and pig respectively.

     'Who is it that owns that dog?' or 'Whose dog is that?'

(364) Nan  g11 je         u    bi            jot      ne?
     2 s ~ kill person which POSS             pig     FQM
     'Whose pig did you kill?'

whichlwhat x

The following examples illustrate the use of u in asking questions about the
identity of a particular thing, such as what type of fish in (365), or what type of




(36s) Nan    sok boge u            ne?
     ~ S G fish      fish which FQM
     'What type of fish do you fish for?'

                           kom     ndo       ne?
     NOM-plant which grow well               FQM
     'Which plants are growing well?'



Questions that ask about the state of something, like a name (367)' or a body
size (368)' and questions that ask about the manner in which something is to
be done (369) and (370), all use sa u 'like which'.


(367) Nan    gum sa       u     ne?
     ~ S G name like      which FQM
     'What is your name?'

(368) Nan      bi   ndar ka     sa          u     ne?
     ~ S G p o s s dog     body like        which FQM
     'What is your dog like?'

(369) Nan jan    weu      sa u     ne?
     ~ S G plant banana like which FQM
     'How do you plant bananas?'

                                                                           Abun marked moods 158




    Questions inquiring into what type of actions someone has done (371) or will
    do in the future (372) use ben sa u 'do like what'. There is an overlap in the
    use of suma and u in these types of questions. In both cases below suma
    could replace u and be syntactically correct. However when suma is used the
    answer sought would be more general in nature, consistent with the
    differentiation between these two interrogative words explained above.


    (371)   Kamekre nggon        ne    ben sa                 u     ne?
            yesterday women DEM do           like             which FQM
            'What did the women do yesterday?'

I
            'What do people here do so that they won't get malaria?'
I
i   where, from where, which direction

    For questions regarding location, source or direction the appropriate
    preposition is used together with u. So for location, mo u means 'where' (373);
    source, kagit u 'from where' (374) and direction, ket u 'which direction' (375).


    (373)   Nan ontu             mo       u     ne?

when

Questions asking about time usually use the interrogative pronumeral, ot,
however, when one is asked to specify the name of the day or month then u
can be used as in (377).


(377) Kam u          ete nan         mu     ne?
       day which then 2so            go     FQM
       'When will you be going?'


6.1.4.2 suma questions

The interrogative word, suma is used to form questions inquiring about the
identity of something (378), the nature of a particular action (379)' the reason
for a particular action (380), or its topicalisation (381).


what
(378) Nan    sok   suma ne?

       'What do you fish for?

       ~ S G do      what      FQM
       'What did he do?'

why
(380) Nan    yo     ma     more nde           wa     suma ne?
       ~ S G NEG    come here NEG             for    what FQM
       'Why didn't you come here?'

why (topicalised)
(381) Suma ben       anato nan    yo     ma more nde          ne?
       what do       FOC   ~ S G NEG     come here NEG        FQM
       'What was the reason that you didn't come here?'
        or 'Why was it that you didn't come?'

The distinction between u and suma is one of specific and general. U is more

specific than suma. Consider the (382) and (383) below.
                                                                     Abun marked moods 160



     (382)   Nan jan       suk-jan     u       ne?
             ~ S G plant N O M - P which
                                       I ~ ~ ~ FQM
             'Which plants did you plant?'

     (383) Nan     jan     soma ne?
             ~ S G plant   what FQM
             'What did you plant?


I    The former is looking for a more specific answer than the latter. We may get
1    an answer like corn, cassava and tomatoes, whereas the answer to the second
11   question may be something more general like, vegetables. Often the answer

1    may not be different, but the latter is more likely to result in a less specific
     answer.


     Suma is limited in its use as an interrogative word to ask questions such as
     'what' or 'why'. However u is more widely used and is involved in periphrasis to
     form most types of questions such as 'who', 'whose', 'what', 'which', 'where',
     'why', 'how' and 'when'.


     The third interrogative word, ot 'how many' is used in forming questions relating
     to quantity and time, i.e., 'when' and 'how many'.


     6.1.4.3 of questions

     The interrogative pronumeral, ot, is used to form questions about time and
     quantity. There is some overlap of u and ot in asking time questions. Compare
     (384) below with (377) above. The difference is that in (377) the answer would

     be expected to name a day or month or other point in time such as next year,
     whereas (384) would expect an answer such as 'in five days' or 'three months',
     that is, with some type of numerical response.


     (384)   Kam ot            ete nan mu         ne?
             day how.many then 2 s ~ go           FQM

There are no tense markers on verbs in Abun, so whether a time question such
as (385) is in the past or future is determined by reference to the context, or by
the special use of the word ete, 'then', as in (384), or be 'later' as in (386) to
indicate future time.

(385)   An    ma      more su      kam ot           ne?

        'When will he come here?' (i.e. in how many days)

how many

To ask about the duration of some event kom mo is used instead of su, as in
(387).


(387)   Nan kem more kom mo kam of                 ne?
        2 s ~ live here for        to day how.many FQM
        'How long have you live here?'

Ot is also used in questions of quantity. In this type, ot follows the noun for a

specific item such as 'pigs' or 'money' with its appropriate classifier, as in (388)
and (389). Refer to section 3.4.1. for a list of classifiers and the types of nouns
to which they apply.

The word wam 'times' does not require a classifier, as in (390) and (391).

        'How many times have you gone to Sorong?'


6.1.4.4 Topicalisation of information seeking questions

Information seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised
(see 4.7.2). In these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-
focus word (or topicaliser) anato, as in (392). The use of this form brings
sukjan 'plants' into greater focus or emphasis than the non-topicalised forms as
in (393) and (394).


(392)Te      suk-jan u          anato nan jan        ne?
     IQM     NOM-plantwhich Foc         2sG plant FQM
        'Which plants are the ones that you planted?'

(393)   Te     nan    jan    suk-jan      u     ne?
        IQM    ~ S G plant NOM-plant      which FQM
        'Which plants did you plant?'

(394)   Nan jan       suma ne?
        ~ S G plant what FQM
        'What did you plant?'

In a sample of 127 information seeking questions, 25% were topicalised.


In Abun the constituents of a sentence that may be topicalised in questions are
the subject (even though it is the topic, it may receive extra focus by the use of
anato) as in (395) and object as in (392).


(395)   Te je        u        anato ndar ne       jau      ne?
        IQM person which Foc           dog DET     bite    Far4
        'Who was it that the dog bit?'
                                                                   Abun marked moods 163




Other constituents such as location in (396) cannot be topicalised.


(396)   *Mo        u     anato       nan     ontu           ne?
        LOC        which FOC         ~ S G   umbilical.cord FQM



6.1.5 Usage of interrogative sentences

Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions.             Instead interrogative
sentences can be used in a rhetorical sense, that is, the speaker is not only
sure of the answer, but also requires no answer.             So on some occasions
although the structure is interrogative the illocutionary force is not. This is plain
in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a 'question'
because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:


a negative statement,      such as (397) and (398).

(397) Ji      da          sok an                sarewo Yefun ne sa u        ne?
        ISG even.though enter church.service but        God  DEM like which FQM
        'Even though I went to church, what was God like?'

        or 'Even though I went to church, I couldn't understand who God was.'

(398)   Ji    yo      bi        os wa ji  kem ~ I        U   Dom    nde
        ISG   NEG     POSS                live in

        'I had no way I could live in Sorong, who could take care of me?'

        or 'I couldn't live in Sorong because there was no one there who would
        have taken care of me.'
                                                                        Abun marked moods 164




An exclamation expressing surprise or even disgust, as in (399).

(399) An    jimnot ware an ki     do             "Surna ben        ji            anato
     ~ S   G think FRUST ~ S Gsay that           what   do         ISG           FOC

     'Ha thought about it with no success, "What ever made me sleep in this
     place and get sick like this?'

     or 'He couldn't work out what made him sleep in a place like that that
     made him so sick.'

Example (399) comes from a narrative, and at this point there was no
                                                                             \

interaction with anyone. He was really disgusted with himself for doing such a
stupid thing. In English we often ask ourselves, "Why did I do such a stupid
thing?", in the sense, "What a stupid thing for me to have done!"                   So the
semantic force of this interrogative structure is not to ask a question but to
make a statement expressing disgust.


A statement expressing uncertainty, as in (400).     This example comes from a
narrative where the speaker was not interacting with anyone.


(400) An  ki    do     "Ye       ne yesugote ye          Waropen bado?"
     3 s ~say that     person that lrianese     person Waropen AQM
     'He said, "Was that lrianese person a Waropen person?"'

     or 'I think he said that the lrianese person was a Waropen person.'

A rebuke or negative command, as   in (401).

(401) Nan  nok wa          suma ne?
     ~ S G afraid for     what FQM
     'Why are you afraid?' or 'Don't be afraid!'

The above type of interrogative structure is a rhetorical question found in cases
where the speaker continues, not waiting for an answer. In the context of
(401), people said (literally), "Why are you afraid? Go on inside!" In saying
                                                                Abun marked moods 165




this they effectively rebuked the one who was being slow about doing what he
should have done.


A condition, as   in (402).

(402)   Yonatan bi   ai     ndo   do          "Te more nu    sugit        yo
        Yonatan poss father asked that        IQM here house food         a

        ~ P L   boil    cassava some   AQM       then later ~ P L eat just

        'Yonatan's father said, "If there is a restaurant here that boils cassava
        then let's just go and eat there."'


6.2 Imperatives

Imperative sentences convey a request, command, order, suggestion,
instruction or an entreaty. Sadock & Zwicky (1985:171) note that since human
social life so frequently consists of activities of requesting, commanding and
the like, that no language (it seems) lacks a form dedicated to imperative
sentences. This is indeed true for Abun.


First we will make some general typological comments about Abun imperative
sentences in relation to universal observations, (6.2.1), followed by a
discussion of the types of imperative sentences found in Abun consisting of the
basic imperative type (6.2.2) a group of two types that may be called hortative
(6.2.3) and an other type labelled prohibitive (6.2.4).



6.2.1 Imperative typology and Abun

Because the imperative mood is basically connected with the second person
and it relates to an action to be performed in the immediate future, the second

person pronoun, tense and aspect distinctions are usually absent because they
are implied. For this reason verbs in the imperative mood in many languages
                                                                Abun marked moods 166




are iii their most basic form. Indeed Lyons (1977:746) points out that in many
languages imperative sentences are characterised by a change in the form of
the main verb of the sentence to its most simple form. However, in Abun, the
form of the verb is exactly the same as for declarative and interrogative moods.
On the other hand, consistent with most languages, tense and aspect
distinctions, which are normally expressed by adverbs and particles in Abun,
are not found in imperative sentences. Instead Abun uses optional particles to
show strength of imperatives. These occur clause finally.


According to Sadock & Zwicky (1983173) the removal of the subject pronoun
andlor verbal concord affix is amazingly common. Abun, however, does not
allow the removal of the subject in imperative sentences. On the contrary,
subject is obligatory in all types of Abun speech acts.


Sadock & Zwicky (1985: 171) also point out that there is considerable diversity
in the way in which imperative sentences are marked, including pre- or post-
sentential particles, verbal clitics, special verb morphology, and intonation. In
Abun, imperative sentences maybe marked or simply left unmarked. Marked

forms are distinguished by the use of one of three optional clause final (or post-
sentential) particle. The three markers are:




                                        Mild     Strong

                      Positive           et      tomise
                      Prohibitive              nde
                                                          .
                                                                  Abun marked moods 167




6.2.2 Basic imperative

The basic imperative in Abun is simply unmarked where the subject of the
sentence is second person, and the established time setting is not in the past
(this is normally clear from the context, as indicated by adverbs, mood or
aspect particles, since there are no tense markers in Abun). The examples
below require a certain context to make them imperative sentences. Without
knowing th? ::ontexl there could be several translations. Intonation is the same
as for indicate sentences, but there may be greater force. For example:


(403)   Nan git         boge mone.
        ~ S G eat      fish     there
        'Eat that fish!' or 'You arelwere eating fish there.'

(404)   Nan syo mbre                sak     dik is ji.
        ~ S G give antique.cloth CLASS      one to     ISG
        'Give me one antique cloth!' or 'You gave one antique cloth to me.'

(405)Nin ma       mo Syurur kekro.
    ~ P L come LOC      Syurur quickly
    'Come quickly to Syurur!' or 'You came to Syurur quickly.'

6.2.3 Hortative

Sadock & Zwicky (1985:160) claim that "most languages have an imperative
restricted to second person logical subjects." To show an exception to this they
refer to Onondaga, which has a general imperative type that occurs in all
persons and numbers and covers a wide range of more specific acts.                  In
labeling such a sentence type, they argue that "The HORTATIVE is in some
languages simply a first or third person form of the imperative.... We might say
that ... (as in Onondaga), there is only a hortative form ..." (1985:77). Abun
likewise does not restrict the subject to second person, but also includes other
persons, thus we have labelled the particles, et as 'MILD HORTATIVE' and tom/se
                                                                     Abun marked moods 168




as 'STRONG HORTATIVE'.^ Unmarked imperatives can also be used with first and
third person as well as second person, as exemplified below.


first person
(406)a. Men mu             mo      nden.              (unmarked)

        'Iwant to burn off its hair, Iwant to cut it up.' or
        'Let me bum off its hair and cut it up!'

        'Lefs carry the canoe to the sea!!'

(409)Dao,         nan ma gi         ba     mo        ji  et!
        Dao     ~ S G come rub      neffle LOC        ISGMHORT
        'Dao, come and rub the neffle on me!'

     ~ S G g0           STHORT
        'Go! !'




*An alternative label that embraces a more general clause type than imperative that could
also be used here is jussive as suggested by Huddleston (1984:360).
                                                                      Abun marked moods 1 8



third person

         3sG     kil!     POSS dog       DET   away MHORT
         'Let him kill his dog!' or 'He should kill his dog.'

(413)An          jammo    ji      et!
         ~ P L listen.to ~ S G MHORT
         'Let them obey me!' or 'They should obey me.'

(414)    Nan    ki   nai Yonas tom             do      an      git sugit tom!!
         ~ S G say to      Yonas STHORT COMP           ~ S   G eat food STHORT
         'Tell Yonas that he is to eat food!!'

The difference between the use of the unmarked form, et and tom is that of the
urgency with which the speaker wants the addressee to perform the act and
also its forcefulness. Tom is a command, where the addressee has no option
to refuse, whereas et and the unmarked form are requests, which allow the
addressee more leeway to refuse or to comply with more slowly. So it may be
said that the differences between the basic imperative, the mild and strong
hortatives are that of immediacy and intensity, with the force of suggestion,
request and command respectively. Thus in (415a) the request (if ascertained
to be one from the context) is not as urgent as in (415b), whereas (415c)
demands immediate action of the addressee.                  In (415d) is the negative
imperative or prohibitive form which is mild to strong depending upon
intonation.


(415)    a. Nan mu me Sadrak bi           im.
            ~ S Ggo see Sadrak p o s s mother
            'Go and see Sadrak's mother.' or 'You went to see Sadrak's mother.'

         b. Nan mu me Sadrak bi          im   et!
            ~ S Ggo see Sadrak p o s s mother MHORT
            Go and see Sadrak's mother!'

         c. Nan mu me Sadrak bi           im  tom!!
            ~ S Ggo see Sadrak p o s s mother STHORT
            Go and see Sadrak's mother!!'
                                                                Abun marked moods 170



        d. Nan mu me Sadrak bi           im   nde!
           ~ s Ggo see Sadrak p o s s mother NEG
           Don't go and see Sadrak's mother!'


6.2.4 Prohibitive

The prohibitive form prohibits action, that is, for example, the addressee is
prohibited from going to see Sadrak's mother in the example above. Compare
the commands for action, in (415a-c) to the prohibition, using nde, in (415d).
This example is a negative imperative applying to the second person.


The prohibitive form also encompasses first and third persons, hence the use
of the label prohibitive rather than negative imperative. The t e n , prohibitive,
includes all persons and numbers in the same way as requests and commands
discussed above do. Examples (416) and (417) show that the meaning can be
regulatory or enforcing a prohibition, making clear this form is not limited to
negative imperatives.      In these examples the third and first persons are
prohibited respectively. For further discussion see 8.1 .I.


(416)   Nggon git    ndam-syor nde!
        Women eat bird-syor       NEG
        'Women must not eat cassowary.'

(417)   Men git sek          nde!
        IPL eat possum NEG
        'We must not eat possum.'

The particle nde does not indicate any difference in urgency, or force as the
positive imperatives do.      Instead nde simply conveys prohibition.          It is
unacceptable to include the hortative particles with nde such as:


(418)    Wan git     ji       bi    sugit   tom     nde!!
        2% eat        1SG POSS      food    STHORT NEG
        'Don't eat my food!!'
                                                                     Abun marked moods 171




Sadock & Zwicky ( I 985: 175) note that a striking feature of negative imperatives
is how differently they are handled from negative declaratives. They say it is
quite unusual for the marks of negation from other sentence types to be added
to the imperative formula. Abun actually takes one of its negative particles
used in declarative sentence types and uses it for making negative imperatives.
Negation in declarative sentences is marked by a linked pair of particles
yo...nde, whereas for negative imperatives, nde alone is used.                Compare
(419a) and (419b).


(419)   a. Nan git gur               nde!
           2 s G eat coconut         NEG
           'Don't eat coconuts.'

        b. Nan yo        git gur        nde.
             ~ S G NEG eat C O C O ~ U ~NEG
             'You do not eat coconuts.'


6.3 Frustrated action

Frustrated action is marked by the particle, ware, which syntactically occurs in
the same position as other mood markers, that is, the last among a group of
clause final particles. Thus we have analysed it as a mood. The particle ware
could be translated as 'in vain', 'to no avail' or 'but without success.'             It's
meaning is that an action was attempted but the goal of the action was not
achieved. For example:


(420)   An      ben     syu-syo         wa nok         ware
        ~ S G make rotan-mouth for         wild.pig FRUST
        'He made a trap for wild pigs but he did not trap any' or 'He made a trap
        for wild pigs but to no avail.'

(421)   An     pet      ndam ware, kunus yo                kom nde
        ~ S G shoot bird        FRUST     arrow    NEG     reach NEG
        'He shot a bird in vain, his arrow did not reach (it).' or 'He tried to shoot a
        bird, but his arrow missed (it).'
                                                                      Abun marked moods 172




Frequently a clause is added following the use of ware as in the above
example to give further information as to how the action was frustrated. In
(420), by contrast we are not sure as to how the action was frustrated. It may
have been that no pigs passed by the trap, or that when the trap went off it did
not catch the pig.


Ware, in common with all mood markers, follows aspect and modal particles
(such as go 'ASSERTIVE'),as seen in the following example:


(422)   Ji      duwer an      mo sor            ndo       nde go        ware.
        ISG     argue ~ S G LOC continually good NEG ASST FRUST
        'I continually argued with him very much, I really did, but to no avail.'
7. Aspect and modality
Two classes of particles that optionally occur immediately preceding any mood
particles are aspect and modality particles. These particles occur in that order.



7.1 Aspect

The notion of aspect, according to Comrie (1976:1-3) tends to be a less familiar
notion to students of linguistics than other terms for verbal categories. In order
to define the t e n , he firstly distinguishes it from tense. He points out that
"aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of a
situation." Lyons (1968:315) also distinguishes tense from aspect by noting
that tense has to do with the loca,tion in time of an action or state, wherezs
aspect has to do with the distribution of time or contour of an action or state.
He claims that the main aspectual notions of 'completion' and 'duration' are
found in many languages.


Abun uses particles to express aspectual notions. The notion of 'completion' is
expressed by two particles, re and it, while the notion of 'incompleteness' is
expressed by a particle, td. When these optional particles occur, they follow
negative markers, where present, but precede mood and modality parlicles.


The use of clause final particles is a unique feature of the Abun language, and
is a particularly unusual way to mark aspect. Foley (1986:143) points out that
aspect tends to be indicated lexically in Papuan languages, most commonly by
the use of serial verb constructions.      He also notes that aspect is also
frequently indicated in Papuan languages by bound verbal affixes. However,

the possibility of indicating aspect by a clause final particle, as in Abun, is not
mentioned in his discussion.
                                                              Abun aspect 8 modality 174




The three Abun aspect particles mentioned above which are used by an Abun
speaker when they want to bring the aspect of completion, or incompletion into
focus, are as follows:




   Particle Type              Definition

   re         perfect        an action or state has or will have occurred,
                             and haslwill have continuing relevance

   it         completive     an action or state is considered finished
   t6         incompletive   an action or state is considered incomplete


Foley (1986:143) also points out, as do other writers (such as Comrie and
Lyons), that aspect says nothing about the relationship between the time of the
event and the time of the speech act, which tense does. Rather, aspect may
describe the distribution of time of an action or state in the past, present or
future.



     Perfect aspect
7.1 .I

Re, a totally different morpheme from the determiner, r6 'this', in the absence of
any contextual of time reference indicates that an event has taken place. The
use of re confirms the actuality of an event, and implies a continuing present
relevance of it.    Such is the definition of 'perfect' suggested by Comrie
(1976:52). By comparing the examples in (423), one can see that the latter
indicates the relevance of the cutting in the continuation of the story. On the
other hand, the former says nothing about the continuing relevance of the cut,
confirmed by the next sentence of its discourse which tells of how the story
teller went to see Moses and the extent of the cut.
                                                                  Abun aspect 8 modality 175



(423)   a. Prisla sap Moses syim brot toko.
           Prisila cut Moses hand vein broken
           'Prisila cut a vein in Moses' hand in half.'

        b. Prisila sap Moses syim brot toko                 re.
           Prisila cut     Moses hand vein broken PERF
           'Prisila had cut a vein in Moses' hand in half.'

Again in (424). Prisila had gone to the mountain, and she was still there when
the next part of the discourse took place, that is, the use of re indicates the
continuing present relevance of a past situation to the coming events. In a
sense it provides the background or situation in which the coming events occur.


(424)   An    mu mo banbo            re.
        ~ S G go    LOC mountain PERF
        'She had gone to the mountain.'

The use of the perfect aspect particle is also common with states such as death
and marriage, for example:


(425)   Pa      ne     kwop re.
        child DET die         PERF
        'The child had died.'

(426)An    kra        Andar bi       im    re.
     ~ S G marry      Andar p o s s mother PERF
        'He had married Andar's mother.'

Comrie (1976:56) discusses four different types of perfect, namely, perfect of
result, experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent situation and the perfect of
recent past. He says that not all languages with forms for perfect meaning
have the full range of meaning listed here. In Abun, the particle re covers the
meaning of the first three types of perfect. In (427), (427b) is a perfect of result
type in that a present state is referred to as being the result of some past
situation, as defined by Comrie (1976:56). In this case it indicates that Fredik
is still in Sorong, whereas (427a) does not necessarily imply that. Normally in
                                                              Abun aspect & modality 176




unmarked cases, the present time is implied unless another time is indicated by
the context.


(427) a.   Fredik mu mo Dom.
           Fredik go        LOC    Sorong
           'Fredik went tolis going to Sorong.'

        b. Fredik mu mo Dom             re.
           Fredik go      LOC    Sorong PERF
           'Fredik has gone to Sorong.'

        c. Fredik mu mo Dom             mo        re.
           Fredik go      LOC    Sorong LoC       PERF
           'Fredik has been to Sorong.'

A second type of perfect is experiential perfect, which Comrie (197658) defines
as a perfect aspect which "indicates that a given situation has held at least
once during some time in the past up to the present." For this aspect an
additional particle, the general locative preposition, mo directly precedes re. It
means that, in ( 4 2 7 ~ for
                         ) ~ example that Fredik has been to Sorong at sometime
(that is, he has experienced going to Sorong), b l ~where
                                                    t     he is now is not under
discussion.


For perfect aspect, Comrie (1976:53) says that it may be present, which
expresses a relation between present state and past situation; past, which
expresses a relation between a past state and an earlier situation; or future,
which expresses a relation between a future state an a situation prior to it.
Examples in Abun of present perfect are as seen in (423b) and (427b). The
form of past perfect, however, is only expressed in a complex sentence, where
re occurs with sa, such as in (428).


(428)   Domingas git mben dik ne or             re sa Geradbi im            ma
        Domingas eat plate one DET completely PERF then Gerad POSS mother come
        'When Domingas had eaten one plate (of food), Gerad's mother came.'
                                                                             Abun aspect & modality 1TI




The perfect in Abun is understood from the context (so (429) can be in either
future or present time), or may be clarified by the use of temporal phrases, like
bere in (430).


(429)   Ji      ben   ji    bi      nggwe     re.
        ISG     do     ISG  POSS garden       PERF
        'I will have been working in my garden.' or 'I had been working in my
        garden.'

(430) Ji      mu aina dik sore bere ji                satu re.
        1SG go      month one only later ISG return PERF
        'I am only going for one month, then I will have returned.'


7.1.2 Completive aspect

Comrie (1976:18), in discussing perfective aspect,l makes the comment that
very frequently perfectivity is characterised by completed action. He says that
this is not quite correct, in that while perfective does indeed indicate a complete
situation, to say it indicates a 'completed' situation puts too much emphasis on
the termination of it. Perfective presents all parts, beginning, middle, and end
as a single whole. It does not place emphasis on the end of a situation or any

other part. The Abun particle it, however, does place emphasis on the end of a
situation, and so here we have called it 'completive' aspect, rather than
'perfective' aspect.


Put in other words, the completive aspect in Abun is used by a speaker
whenever they want to focus on the finality of an action. For example, when a
decision has been made about something after discussion, the use of the
particle it makes it clear that a final decision has been reached, as in (431).




' This is distinct from perfect aspect as used above. Comrie makes a sharp distinction
between perfect and perfective. The aspects re and it in Abun are similar to what Comrie
defines as perfect and perfective respectively, but the latter is slightly different from perfective
in the way it places emphasis on the finality of the action, hence we have used the term
completive instead of perfective for it.
                                                                   Abun aspect & modality 178



(43 I )   Suk-sin     ne    yenggras ki-bot           it.
          NOM-Wrong DET elders          speak-about COMPL
          'On that wrong-doing, the elders have discussed it (and made a final
          decision).'

Also when an Abun speaker tells a story, they frequently finish with (432). The
particle it is clearly used to indicate finality or completed action. It is used to
emphasise the terminal point of actions such as speaking (431), or killing (433)
and states such as knowing (434).


(432)     Or                  it.
          completely          COMPL
          'The end.'

(433)     Sinus gu       ge     yo     h o p it.
          Sinus kill     body a        die     COMPL
          'Sinus has already killed one (wife).'

(434)An         jam     baca ndo it.
          ~ S G know read       good COMPL
          'She already knows how to read well.' or 'Her knowledge of how to read
          well has been brought to completion.'

Completive aspect may emphasise the termination of a situation is either past
or future.         The examples above refer to the past in their contexts.             Two

examples below show how completive aspect may be used in a future.


(435)     An      bi nggon jam          it     e?
          ~ S GPOSS wife       know     COMPLFQM
          'Does your wife (finally) know yet?'

(436)     Yesyim, nan git sugit   kokro   we      noru it
          friend 2 s ~eat NOM-eat quickly because night COMPL
          bere         wo       kwai git   if.
          later        fish     kwai eat   COMPL

          "Friend, eat the food quickly because it is already night time, the kwai fish
          will finally be biting.'
                                                                   Abun aspect & modality 179




    7.1.3 Incompletive aspect

    A third aspect type in Abun is that of incompletive, that is, the termination point
    of an action or state has not yet taken place. In other words, that action or
    state is still going on. Traditionally this aspect type is known as imperfective or
    continuous.      The particle tb is used clause finally to indicate this where
    necessary. Thus in (137) the action of speaking is still continuing, and in (438)
    the state of Lamberta being single still continues, and in (439) the action (or,
    should we say, inaction) of 'not going' continues.


    (437)   An    nuk         sukdu    t6.
            ~ P L speak       NOM-Say INCOMPL
            'They are still speaking.'

    (438)   Lamberta an nggon-nak              td.
            Lamberta 3sG woman-single INCOMPL
            Lamberta is still a single woman.'

    (439)   Men yo       mu nde           t6.
            1PL NEG g0         NEG        INCOMPL
            'We are not going yet.'

    Like the other aspects the incompletive may occur in the past, present or
    future. Those examples above illustrate incompletive aspect in the present.
    Example (440) is in the past (which requires a complex sentence), and (441) is
    in the future.


    (440)   Kamekre an git sugit            t6      ete kwis ges          mo an.
            yesterday 3 s eat

            'Yesterday he was still eating and a snake fell on him.'

    (441)   Be      Yen      Qu Yu            t6.

            'People would still be fighting each other.'

    7.1.4 Interaction of Abun aspects


I   The perfect and completive aspects are very similar in many respects. Abun
    speakers who know Indonesian translate re and it with one word, sudah which
                                                                Abun aspect & modality 180




is perfect aspect in Indonesian. Both of these aspects mean that something
has occurred or will have occurred, with the latter giving greater emphasis to
the finality of the action as explained above. In English this distinction is hard
to express systematically. Take, for example, (442a) and (442b), both of these
sentences mean that the coming has occurred, the former emphasises that the
coming has occurred and he is still here, while the latter emphasises that his
coming has finally occurred, with the implication that he is still here. So Abun
speakers may use either depending upon which facet they want to emphasise.


(442)a.    An   ma       re.
           ~ S GWme PERF
           'He has arrived.'

     b. An      ma       it.
           ~ S Gcome COMPL
           'He has finally arrived.'

An Abun speaker may also simply say, An ma 'He camelis coming', which does
not emphasise either the persistence of the result (that is, that he is still there)
or the finality of his coming. Normally, when a group of people are waiting for a
particular person to arrive, and then someone sees him coming, they would
announce as in (442b) because the finality of the action is of importance to the
hearers.


In a language like Abun which does not use specific tense markers, these two
aspect markers have a close relationship with past time, especially in the
absence of any contextual indications of time reference, such as a temporal
adverbial. Likewise, when aspect is unmarked there is a close relationship with
present time. Comrie (1976:83) makes similar comments regarding the role of
aspect in languages without tense markers.
                                                              Abun aspect & modality 181




In answer to a question like that in (435) above, one may answer including
either of the aspect markers, re or t6. The actual answer given by the speaker
was:

(443)   An   ki do       "Nde re.     An      bi     nggon jam nde        to."
        ~ S GSay COMP NEG PERF ~ S G PERF wife              know NEG      INCOMPL
        'He said, "No. His wife does not yet know."'

He wanted to emphasise two aspects here. First his wife did not know and this
'not knowing' persisted (nde re), and, secondly, she did not yet know and this
'not knowing' still continued, or, in other words, the 'knowing' was not yet
completed (nde to).


According to Comrie (1976:24), languages may combine several aspects where
they are compatible and there are formal means to do so. Abun speakers may
follow tc5 with re, as seen in (444), but no evidence has been found of re
followed by t6 or combinations of t6 and if, or re and it.


(444)   An yo      ma       nde    tb     re.
        ~ S GNEG Come NEG          INCOMPL PERF
        'He has still not come.'


7.2 Modality

Modality has been defined by Lyons (1977:452) as the attitude or opinion of the
speaker towards the proposition that the sentence expresses or the situation
that the proposition describes. Lyons considers modality to be a parenthetical
sentence-adverb that expresses speaker's attitudes such as certainty,
necessity, possibility, and doubt. In Abun, a syntactically distinct closed class
of words expresses a speaker's attitude in some of these ways. The modals
and their types are listed in the table below.
Particle   Modal type    Meaning

Ya         possibility   'might'

bayok      probability   'maybe, could, probably'

90         assertive     'should, could really, will certainly'
                                                                Abun aspect 8 modality 183



(447)   Kamekre an ma mo-re                Ya.
        yesterday ~ S Gcome LOC-here POSSIB
        'He possibly came here yesterday.'


7.2.2 Probability

The particle that a speaker uses to indicate that a proposition expressed is
probably true is bayok. The particle bayok is most commonly used when the
speaker is confident of the general amount, but not sure of the exact number,
both with quantities as seen in (448), and time (449).


(448)    Yenggras ki-bot          sor warn mek bayok.
        elders      speak-about until times five PROB
        'The elders spoke about (a marriage partner for me) probably five times.'

(449)   Pa      kern wade aina dik          bayok.
        child stay until month one PROB
        'The child probably stayed (there) for one month.'

Other expressions of probably having sufficient (450), or of probably receiving
of help in the future (451), or probably of finally understanding something (452)
all use the same particle.       Note the position of the particle, it follows the
negative particle, nde in (450), as well as aspect particles, such as it in (452).


(450)   Ji    bi      sugum yo       tep      nde      bayok.
        ~ S G POSS money NEG enough           NEG      PROB
        'I probably don't have enough money.'

(451)   Bere Yonatan bi          ai      os     nan bayok.
        later Nathan p o s s father help 2 s ~PRO0
        'Nathan's father will probably help you.'

(452)   An    jam            if     bayok.
        ~ S G understand COMPL PROB
        'He probably finally understood.'

As noted above, modality says nothing about the time of an event and the time

of the speech act in relation to it, rather modal particles express the speaker's
attitude about a proposition, so modality is not related to tense. Thus, like
                                                                          Abun aspect & modality 184




    aspect particles, the modal particle bayok may be used irrespective of the time
    referred to, such as present in (450), future in (451), and past in (452).


    7.2.3 Assertive

    The third type of modality is assertive, which means that the speaker asserts
    very strongly that his attitude about the proposition is really true. In other
    words, the speaker parenthetically comments, "I really mean it.", or in
    Australian colloquial terms, "fair dinkum".             In a culture where deception is
    considered positive, speakers need a way to convince the hearer that they
    mean business. So in Abun a modal particle, go is used to do this.                         For
    example:


    (453)   Nan      ges go.
            ~ S G fall      ASST
            'You will surely fall.' or 'You will fall, I mean it.'

    (454)   An   ndo mo ye             ~i an         ndo mo ji           sore go.
            ~ S Gask   LOC person other 3 s ~ask            Loc I S G only ASST
            'He asked another person, but he should have just asked me, really.'

    (455)   Be an       bi      ya         gu an kwop                re   go.
            later 3 s ~~ o s shusband kill ~ S Gdie                  PERF ASST
            'Her husband will have killed her, I mean it.'

    This modal particle can be used in the past, as seen in (454), but it is usually
    used in reference to an event that is about to take place, as seen in (453) and
    (455).



    7.2.4 Differences between modal particles

    Modal particles do not co-occur. To change from one to another results in a
    change of degree of intensity. There is a progression of certainty from one
    particle to the next. When mode is unmarked, nothing is indicated in the
I
    speaker's attitude. When ya is used the speaker expresses their attitude that
                                                                   Abun aspect 8 modality 105




the proposition is possibly true, whereas bayok is a little stronger, that is,
probably true, while go asserts the truth of the proposition very strongly, almost
a certive attitude.

8. Negation

Negation may take a variety of forms, such as 'negative verbs', negative
particles or fully bound derivational morphemes (Payne 1985a:222). According
to Payne, the use of negative particles is the most likely form of negation, as is
the case in Abun.


This chapter presents the negation strategy used in Abun. Two particles form
the basis of negation. The prima.y particle is nde which is a typical particle, a
function word that is invariant. Consistent with the isolating nature of the Abun
language, nde does not vary for tense, aspect, number or agreement. While
nde is primary, a further particle, yo, also invariant, is used in conjunction with
it, mainly in the negation of indicative sentences. These two particles bracket
the predicate. In Abun whenever two particles are used like this the function is
to mark the extent of a particular grammatical constituent. Bracketing by a pair
of particles is not only one of the main strategies used in negation but is also
used in the formation of relative clauses, both restrictive and unrestrictive (see
C Berry 1995), as well as interrogative sentences (see 6.1). In most cases of
negation, the pair of particles, yo ... nde bracket the predicate to negate Abun
sentences.


The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as
the primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means 'no'. When a
question is asked and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in
reply. In contrast, the other negative particle, yo is only used in conjunction
with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the primary or basic negative
particle.
                                                                        Abun negation 187




    The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative
    alternative questions and negative equational sentences (8.1).


    The secondary particle y~ is used in conjunction with the primary particle in the
    formation of the following sentence types:       negative indicative sentences,
    negative information seeking interrogatives, negative descriptive sentences,
    negative location sentences and in the negation of subordinate clauses (8.2).


    Placement of the negative particles when they occur is invariant, yo always
    precedes the predicate, while nde always follows the predicate. The following
    example illustrates negation of a simple indicative sentence, where both yo and
    nde are obligatory:

    (456)   a.   An     ma     mo nu.
                 ~ P L come LOC house
                 'They came to the house.'

            b.   An     )/o      ma       mo nu         nde.
                 ~ P L NEG       come     LOC   house   NEG
                 'They did not come to the house.'

    In the above example the predicate, ma mo nu is bracketed by the linked pair
    of particles, yo follows the subject and precedes the predicate, and nde follows

    the predicate. If, for example, the subject of a negative indicative sentence is
    preceded by yo, this would be syntactically unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
    Word order here is rigid. The particles must bracket the whole predicate, PRED
    (includes v, o and any adjuncts). The subject is never included within the
    bracket for reasons discussed under the scope of negation in 8.5.


    There are two patterns of negation found in Abun as follows:
I
                                      S PRED nde

                                     s yo PRED nde
                                                                     Abun negation 188




They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In svo
languages the negative particle normally precedes the verb (Payne
1985a:224). One would expect the particle nde to be preverbal, but instead in
Abun it is not only postverbal but also postobject and adjunct. This pattern
type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented languages such as
Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi and Tera (Payne 1985a:226).


Furthermore the second pattern type where a pair of linked negative particles
occur is also uncommon.       In French a linked pair of particles is used in
negation, but this pair only brackets the verb and its associated clitics, whereas
in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole predicate including object and
adjuncts.   However, this pattern type is an attested one in some Chadic
languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1985a:225,6).                     The
difference with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun.
In Hausa both particles can move to bracket the constituent that is to be
negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the scope and focus of negation
(Schachter 1985:60).


Syntax of negation involving the use of nde (8.1), the use of yo (8.2), negation
in subordinate clauses (8.3), negation in words (8.4) and a discussion of the
scope of negation in Abun (8.5) provides an organising framework for the
remainder of this chapter.



8.1 The use of nde

As indicated earlier. the simplest negative sentence is just the negative reply to
a question, "Nde." In this section types of negative structures that require the
use of nde without yo are discussed. Those types of structure are: prohibitive
                                                                   Abun negation 189




sentences, positive-negative alternative questions, and negative equational
sentences.


8.1.IProhibitive sentences

The primary negative particle, nde is the only negative particle used to form
prohibitive sentences. The structure of this type of sentence is s PRED nde, as
in (457b). The prohibitive sentence structure is used in Abun when the speaker
wants to prohibit the subject doing a particular thing.    Negative imperative
sentences are the most common type of prohibitive sentence. Example (457a)
is a simple indicative sentence, while (457b) is the same sentence transformed
to become a negative imperative sentence.


(457)   a.   Nan     wo.
             ~ S G Cry
             'You are crying.'

        b.   Nan      wo    nde!
             ~ S G Cry      NEG
             'Don't cry!'

Here we have used the label prohibitive to cover a more general type of
negative imperative (which includes first and third person, as well as second
person) to distinguish it from the normal use of the term negative imperative,
which implies a negative command to only the second person, as discussed by
Sadock & Zwicky (1985: 160) and in 6.2.3.


The same structure is used in Abun for all prohibitive sentences including first
and third persons, as in (458) and (459). In these cases the English translation
is more like "We must not eat possum!" or "Women must not touch cassowary!"
                                                                    Abun negation 1W)



(458) a.     Men git sek.
             ~ P L eat possum
             'We are eatinglate possum.'

        b.   Men git sek          nde.
             ~ P L eat possum NEG
             'We must not eat possum.'

(459)   a.   Nggon syimtok ndamsyor.
             women touch       cassowary
             'The women are touchingltouch cassowaries.'

        b.   Nggon syimtok ndamsyor nde.
             women touch       cassowary NEG
             'Women must not touch cassowaries.'


8.1.2 Positive-negative alternative questions

The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative
alternative questions. The structure of this type is:

                               s PRED bad0 nde e?

These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-
negative alternative, "Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?, as in (460)
where a person is being asked to make a decision between positive or negative
alternatives.


(460)   Nan satu        mo nan bi        nggon bado, nde e?
        2p    go.back L o c 2p p o s s woman AQM       NEG YNQM
        'Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?'

Example (461) has the same structure, but differs in meaning. It comes from a
text where the speaker is lecturing another about his relationship with his wife.
He is not asking whether the one addressed thinks about his wife, or not, as in
a positive-negative alternative type of question. Rather he is using it as a

rhetorical question with the meaning, "You don't think about your wife!" The
context makes it clear when a negative tag question is being asked or is being
used rhetorically.
                                                                       Abun negation 191



(461)   Nan nutbot          nan bi         nggon         bado,   nde   e?
        ~ S G think-about 2 s ~p o s s woman             AQM     NEG   YNQM
        'Don't you think about your wife?'

Negative yes-no interrogative structures such as, 'Are you not going? are not
used in Abun. Instead the Abun speaker would formulate this type of question
as, Alan mu e? 'Are you going?'



8.1.3 Negative equational sentences

Equational sentences, which attribute a nominal to the subject, are negated by
the use of nde. These sentence types are verbless and their structure as
shown in the examples below is:
                                S NOMINAL   nde

(462)   a.    An     ye-nden.
              ~ S G person-inland
              'He is an inland person.'

        b.    An     ye-nden         nde.
              ~ S G person-inland NEG
              'He is not an inland person.'

(463)   a.    Ji    bi      ai     yewon.
              ISG   POSS father shaman
              'My father is a shaman.'

        b.    Ji    bi      ai      yewon         nde.
              ~ S GPOSS father shaman             NEG
              'My father is not a shaman.'

When the nominal is a demonstrative the same pattern is followed, as in (464)
below.


(464)   a.   Ndar anane.
             dog      DET
             'That is a dog.'

        b.   Ndar anane nde.
             dog      DET     NEG
             'That is not a dog.'
                                                                   Abun negation 192




Where the subject is a possessed item the same structure is used. Example
(465) illustrates alienable possession and (466) illustrates inalienable
possession, and (465b) and (466b) show the negation of these type of
equational sentences.


(465)a.     An   bi      nu      anane.
            ~ S GPOSS house DET
            'That is his house.'

     b.     An   bi      nu      anane nde.
            ~ S GPOSS house DET        NEG                                    - -   -




            'That is not his house.'

(466)a.     Ji     de      anane.
            ~ S G blood DET
            'That is my blood.'

     b.     Ji     de      anane nde.
            ~ S G blood DET         NEG
            'That is not my blood.'


8.2 The use of yo

The negative particle yo is used in negative indicative sentences, information
seeking interrogative sentences, negative descriptive and location sentences
and in the negation of complex sentences.       It is never used to negate a
sentence by itself, but is always linked with the primary negative particle nde.
These two particles form a linked pair that bracket the predicate of the
sentence. The particle yo always occurs between a subject and predicate.
The word order is rigid.


The use of linked pairs of negative particles is uncommon. However French is
a well documented example of the use of a linked pair of negative particles.
For example je ne... pas. The first particle ne is the primary particle and then
pas is added. Payne (1985a:224) claims that in the case where such linked

pairs of negative particles do occur, the second particle occurs because there
                                                                      Abun negation 193




is a strong tendency for a single negative particle to be reinforced and
emphasised by the addition of a second particle. Payne analyses pas as the
added particle that reinforces the negation in French.


By way of contrast, Abun places the primary particle after the predicate, not
before as in French. Also the operation of the secondary particle in Abun is not
so much to reinforce the negation of a sentence as Payne claims of French, but
rather to mark the predicate and thus delineates the scope of negation.


8.2.1 Negative indicative sentences

The basic structure of a negative indicative sentence is:

                                 S YO PRED nde


Whatever elements are within the predicate, such as verb, object, any adjuncts,
and embedded clauses, all are bracketed by the pair of particles, yo and nde.
Irrespective of whether the sentence is intransitive, transitive or ditransitive yo
remains constant in both form and position. Likewise, nde remains constant in
form and position. Each of these sentence types are illustrated in the examples
below.


(467)   a.   Pa        mwa it         mo kelas gri.           (intransitive)
             children many rise LOC class three
             'Many children did go up to grade three.'

        b.   Pa        mwa yo         it     mo      kelas   gn'   nde.
             children many NEG rise Loc              class   three NEG
             'Many children did not go up to grade three.'

(468)   a.   Men ku mbre               ne     mo nu.    (transitive)
             IPL   find eastern.cloth DET LOC house
             'We found the eastern cloth in the house.'

        b.   Men yo       ku mbre             ne      mo nu       nde.
             ~ P L NEG find eastern.cloth DET         LOC   house NEG
             'We didn't find the eastern cloth in the house.'
                                                                        Abun negation 194



(469) a.        Ye       syo sugum nai ji.             (ditransitive)
             ~ I N D E F give money to  ISG
             'They gave money to me.'

      b.        Ye      yo   syo sugum nai       ji    nde.
             ~ I N D E FNEG give money to         ~ S GNEG
             'They didn't given money to me.'


8.2.2 Negative information seeking interrogatives

In contrast to positive-negative alternative questions, negative interrogative
sentences seeking information require both negative particles, yo and nde,
such as in the following examples.


(470) a.   Te nan        ma wa       suma ne?
           IQM ~ S G come for        what FQM
           'Why have you come?'

     b.    Te        nan yo ma    nde wa         suma ne?
           IQM   ~ S GNEG Come NEG for           What FQM
           'Why didn't you come?'

(471) a.   Je      u    ana     ma   ne?
           person what TOP      come FQM
           'Who has come?'

     b. Je      u      ana yo           ma   nde       ne?
        person which TOP NEG            come NEG       FQM
        'Who has not come?'

Take note that the interrogative mood also has two bracketing particles, te the
'Initial Question Marker' and ne 'Final Question Marker'.        The bracketing
required to negate a clause falls within the bracketing required to form an
interrogative construction, as seen in (470b).



8.2.3 Negative descriptive sentences

A descriptive sentence is defined as a sentence that attributes an adjective to a

noun, for example, 'Musa has a big arm', or 'The book is old.' The behaviour of
words that could be considered adjectives in Abun does not differ greatly from
                                                                    Abun negation 195




that of verbs. These words can act as predicates, and so both particles are
required to negate these sentence types. In such sentences the adjectival part
of the sentence is negated using the linked pair of yo and nde. The structure of
negative descriptive sentences as shown in the examples below is:

                               S yo ADJECTIVE nde


(472)   a.   lsak     bi      nggwe     sye.
             lsak     poss garden       big
             'Isak's garden is big.'

        b.   lsak    bi      nggwe yo          sye   nde.
             lsak    pass garden NEG           big   NEG
             'IsaKs garden is not big.'

(473)   a.   Musa i.
             Musa sick
             'Musa is sick.'

        b.   Musa yo        i    nde.
             Musa NEG sick NEG
             'Musa is not sick.'

This same construction holds when the subject of the sentence is expanded, for
example, by means of a relative clause such as 'The children who went up to
third grade'. The description of this subject, namely mwa 'many', is negated in
the same way, using the linked pair, as in the example below.


(474)   a.   Pa       ga    it   mo kelas gri         ne    mwa
             children who rise LOC grade three DET many
             "The children who went up to grade three were many.'

        b.   Pa       ga    it   mo kelas gri         ne    yo    mwa nde
             children who rise LOC grade three DET NEG many NEG
             "The children who went up to grade three were not many.'
                                                                     Abun negation 196




8.2.4 Negative location sentences

A location sentence attributes a location to the subject. Since location is one of
the predicate elements it also is negated by using both particles. The structure
as shown in the examples below is:
                                                nde
                        S yo LOCATIVE PHRASE~WORD


(475)   a.   Musa mo nu.
             Musa LOC house
             'Musa is at home.'

        b.   Musa yo        mo nu   nde.
             Musa NEG LOC house NEG
             'Musa is not at home.'

(476)   a.   Dao bi       im       mo-re.
             Dao poss mother LOC-here
             Dads mother is here.'

        b.   Dao bi        im       yo       mo-re nde.
             Dao Poss mother NEG             LOC-hereNEG
             Dao's mother is not here.'

The locative phrase has the preposition, mo (as in the examples above), which
also in some contexts means 'to exist', the negation of which follows the same
pattern as in any negative indicative sentence, as in the example below.


(477)   a.   Sugum mo.
             money      exist
             'There is money.'

        b.   Sugum yo        mo nde.
             money      NEG exist NEG
             'There is no money.'


8.2.5 Negation in complex sentences

Complex sentences, where a clause is embedded within a main clause, are
negated in Abun in the same way as simple sentences. The pattern is:

                                 S yo PRED   nde,
                                                                   Abun negation 197




where clauses may be embedded in the object position, such as in (478). The
word order remains rigid in these constructions, with the whole of the predicate
including the embedded clause bracketed by the particles.


(478) a.     Ji    me lsak ben suk             mo     nggwe.
             ISG see lsak do things LOC               garden
             'I saw lsak working in the garden.'

        b.   Ji   yo      me lsak ben suk           mo     nggwe nde.
             I S G NEG see lsak do things Loc              garden NEG
             'I did not see lsak working in the garden.'

A complement expressing indirect speech is introduced by a subordinating
conjunction, do, and is also embedded in the object position as in (479). The
negation of this type of complex sentence follows the same pattern as for a
simple sentence.


(479)   a. Moses ki        gad0     do an       kra    su    Barbarina o.
           Moses say earlier that 3 s ~marry with Barbarina again
           'Earlier Moses said again that he would marry Barbarina.'

    b. Moses yo ki         gad0 do an kra su Barbarina o                nde.
       Moses NEG say earlier that ~ S Gmarry with Barbarina again NEG
       'Earlier Moses did not say again that he would marry Barbarina.'


8.2.6 The interaction of yo and nde

In summary, the negation of a sentence with just the primary particle nde
means that one is not allowed or prohibited to do a particular thing, as in
(480b). In contrast to this, the addition of the secondary negative particle, or
predicate marker, yo, changes the nature of the sentence to become simply a
negative indicative statement, as in (480~).
                                                                       Abun negatkm 198



(480)   a.   An ma.
             3s come
             'He came.'

        b.   An ma nde.
             3s Come NEG
             'He cannot come.'

        c.   An yo       ma     nde.
             3s NEG Come NEG
             'He did not come.'

The use of nde alone implies that there is something that prevents or makes it
impossible for the person to do something, as in the example, "He cannot
come." We do not actually know why he cannot come. But when the speaker
simply wants to make an indicative statement that he has not, or did not come,
then the additional particle, yo makes that clear. That is, there was nothing
preventing the person from coming, they just haven't come.



8.3 Negation in subordinate clauses

According to Payne (1985a:240), in many languages the devices which are
used for negating subordinate clauses are different from those used in main
clauses. He cites several examples, including Yoruba where the main clause
negative particle is kd, while the particle used to negate subordinate clauses is
md. In Abun most subordinate clauses are negated in the same way main
clauses are negated, the only exception being negative purpose subordinate
clauses, as in English, 'lest' (or 'in order that ... not).


For example, in (481a) the whole sentence is negated. By way of contrast,
(481b) illustrates how the embedded clause itself may be negated, resulting in
a different meaning. The same pair of negative particles is used.


(481)   a.   Ji   yo      me lsak ben suk           mo        nggwe nde.
             I S G NEG see lsak do          things LOC        garden NEG
             'I did not see lsak working at the garden.'
        b.    Ji    me lsak yo            ben suk      mo        nggwe       nde.
              1 s see lsak NEG do               things LOC       garden      NEG
              'I saw lsak not working at the garden.'

Again, when the subordinate clause is indirect speech introduced by the
subordinating conjunction, do,the negation of that clause uses the same pair
of linked particles. In (482a) the whole sentence is negated, whereas (482b)
shows the negation of the subordinate clause.


(482)   a. Moses yo ki         gado do an           kre su Barbafine o      nde.
           Moses NEG say earlier that 3 s marry with Barbarina again NEG
           'Earlier Moses did not say again that he would marry Barbarina.'

    b. Moses ki gado do an               yo kre su Behannao          nde.
       Moses say earlier that 3 s ~NEG marry with Barbarina again NEG
       'Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.'

Abun does have a form corresponding to the English 'lest' which consists of the
preposition, kadif 'from' linking together with the primary negative particle, nde
to bracket the subordinate clause as illustrated in (483).


(483) Nan     os     ji      kadit jj        ku     suki          nde.
        2 s ~ help ISG       lest      ISG   get sickness NEG
        'Help me lest Iget sick.' or ' Help me in order that I don't get sick.'

(484) Nan      os    ji     kadit ji    mu ket os            ibit   nde.
      ~ S G    help 1SG lest I S G go          along way bad NEG
        'Help me from not going on a bad way.' or 'Help me lest I go on a bad
        way.'

In both (483)and (484) the preposition kadif 'from' which normally preempts a
noun phrase, in this case is followed by an embedded clause. Embedded
clauses of this nature, when negated, do not use the secondary negative
particle yo, even though they may be of the sentence type that normally
requires both negative particles, since it has been replaced by kadit.


A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the
case where a relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the
                                                                      Abun negation 200




whole sentence. In such a case only one nde is required, as in (485a). This
particle forms the bracket for both the subordinate clause and the sentence.
There are two occurrences of yo in (485a), whereas in (485b) only the relative
clause is negated, while in (485c) the whole sentence is negated.


(485)a.   An     yo   git    roti     gato yo           it     nde.
          ~ S G NEG eat      bread REL         NEG      rise   NEG
          'He did not eat bread that was not risen.'

     b.   An     git roti     gat0 yo        it        nde.
          ~ S G eat bread REL          NEG rise        NEG
          'He ate bread that was not risen.'

     c.   An     yo    git roti      gato it           nde.
          3 ~ 6 ; NEG eat bread REL          rise      NEG
          'He did not eat bread that was risen.'

A similar structure with two occurrences of yo and one of nde is used to
indicate that a particular action has never been done, or not existed as in (486).
Both occurrences of yo are preferred here because Musa does not eat fish and
he has not ever done this. The second occurrence of yo can be omitted, but
Abun speakers tend to include it to reinforce the point they are making - "Musa
doesn't eat fish, he never does."


(486)Musa yo     git    boge yo          mo nde.
     Musa NEG eat fish NEG               exist NEG
    'Musa has never eaten fish.'


8.4 Negation in words

Abun is a language with very little affixation. As may be expected there are no
affixes used to negate words as in the case of English with words such as un-
happy and dis-like. However, there are a number of verbs that are inherently
negative in meaning such as:

  ban          'do not want',
  bagn         'do not want to eat'.
                                                                            Abun negation 201




1      bambrai       'do not want to do something"
       bandof        'do not feel comfortable with heights'
       bagwo         'do not like being tickled'
    Ba- could be analysed as a negative prefix, but the roots -ri, -gri. -braiJ -ndof
    and q w o do not occur as free morphemes.


    These verbs remove the need for the use of the negative particles. Example
    (487a) is a negative indicative sentence. The use of an inherently negative
    verb, bariwa 'do not want to', as in (487b), without the negative particles has
    the same meaning. The use of the inherently negative verb with the negative
    particles makes the meaning a positive one, as in (487c)


    (487)a.     Ji    yo     i-wa           ji      mu    mo     nggwe nde.
                1SG NEG want-TRANS           1SG go       LOC    garden NEG
                'I don't want to go to the garden.'

          b.    Ji    ban-wa                ji      mu mo        nggwe.
                ISG   do.not.want-TRANS ISG         go LOC       garden
                'I don't want to go to the garden.'

          c.    Ji   yo     ban-wa               ji   mu mo nggwe nde.
                I S G NEG do.not.want-TRANS I S G go LOC            garden NEG
                'I am not against going to the garden.' or 'I want to go to the garden.'


    8.5 The scope of negation

    Klima (1964), Reesink (1986) and Payne (1985a) discuss the scope of
    negation in terms of 'constituent' and 'sentential'. The negation of words or
    phrases may be called 'constituent negation', while the negation of predicates,
    sentences and more complex sentences have traditionally been called
    'sentential negation.'    These two terms were coined initially in relation to
    English.    In the sentence, 'John is unhappy', the negation is defined as
    'constituent' because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the
    sentence, while in 'John is not happy', the type of negation is defined as
    'sentential'.
                                                                     Abun negation 202




In Abun the scope of negation is usually sentential (or, more precisely, the
negation of the predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked
pair of negative particles (8.5.1). Take, for example, sentence (488), a simple
negative indicative sentence where the two negative particles surround the
predicate. In this case, the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the
location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of negation. The subject
(Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.


(488)lsak    yo       gu      nok          mo syur Nai          de   nde.
     lsak     NEG kill        wild.pig     LOC      water Nai   bank NEG
     'Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.'

As to which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker
would in most cases be clear from the context, but there are syntactic
strategies by which the scope of negation can be narrowed to focus on one
constituent. This is discussed in 8.5.2.


8.5.1 The scope with both negative particles

The scope of negation is readily determined by the use of the linked pair of
negative particles, yo and nde. These two particles bracket the predicate
making the scope of negation syntactically evident. In Abun the scope of
negation, when the linked pair of negative particles is used, is always encoded
as a predicate since the linked particles always and only bracket a predicate.
The subject can never be bracketed by the two negative particles.


Payne (1985a:199) points out that subjects are usually context bound and that
contextually bound elements are removed from the scope of negation. What is
actually negated is the contextually free part of the sentence. This, he says,
"often gives the impression that sentential negation might better be described
                                                                         Abun n e g a h 203




as 'VP negation"'. Indeed for Abun this is clearly the case because the syntax
makes that evident by the way the two particles bracket the predicate (that is,
the VP).


Therefore when both particles are used, the scope of negation excludes the
subject. When we consider a situation where someone is discussing a hunting
trip, one might say, 'Isak killed a pig near the Nai river'. In order to negate this
sentence, one would say, 'lsak did not kill a pig near the Nai river.', as in (488).
In this example, the subject, lsak, is not within the scope of negation because it
is contextually bound, that is, Isak's actions were under discussion. It is the
relationship between lsak and the killing of a pig near the Nai river that falls
within the scope of the negation. The scope of negation when both particles
are used is the predicate, as is evidenced by the position of the two negative
particles.


So it is either the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the
Nai river) that could be negated. All three of these fall within the scope of
negation. The subject, lsak, does not. As to which constituent is actually being
negated in the mind of the speaker would in most cases be clear from the
context.


The shifting of words and phrases from outside to inside the bracketing of the
linked pair negative particles illustrates that the two particles do in fact
determine the scope of negation.         In (489), if kamdik-kamdik 'everyday' is
included within the bracket it is also included within the scope of negation. If it
is inside the bracket as in ( 4 8 9 ~ )then
                                        ~ the frequency of eating fish is also
negated, so the meaning changes to 'I do not eat fish everyday', or 'Not
everyday I eat fish', implying that on some days fish is eaten, but not everyday.
Example (489b) has 'everyday' outside of the bracket formed by the linked pair
                                                                        Abun negation 204




of particles. In this way the action of eating, and the object, fish, are within the
scope of negation, but not the frequency. The temporal word in this case is
outside of the scope of negation.         In this way the two negative particles
delineate the scope of negation in the sense that whatever falls between them
falls within the scope of negation.


(489)   a.   Ji      git   boge kamdik-kam-dik.
             ISG     eat fish      day-one-day-one
             'Ieat fish everyday.'

        b.   Kamdik-kam-dik       ji       yo     git   boge nde.
             day-one-day-one       ISG     NEG eat      fish      NEG
             'Everyday I do not eat fish.' or 'I never eat fish.'

        c.   Ji      yo   git    boge kamdik-kam-dik nde.
             ISG     NEG eat     fish day-oneday-one NEG
             'Not everyday I eat fish.' or 'I do not eat fish everyday
              (I do sometimes).'

Phrases may be inserted either before the subject or within the predicate such
as temporal phrases or locative phrases as seen in (489) and (490). Phrases
placed outside yo...nde are outside the scope of negation.


(490)   a.   lsak yo ben suk mo nggwe nde.
             lsak NEG do things Loc garden NEG
             'Isak did not do anything at the garden.'

        b.   Mo      nggwe     lsak yo       ben suk      nde.
             LOC     garden    lsak NEG do         things NEG
             'In the garden lsak did not do anything.'

In (490a), the garden falls within the scope of negation. lsak may not have
been at the garden.      He may have done things elsewhere. In (490b), the
garden is outside the scope of negation.         It is contextually bound, since a
construction of this nature only occurs when the garden is being discussed.
Information considered contextually free is bracketed by particles.
                                                                      Abun negation 205




In complex sentences it is clear how the scope of negation changes according
to what is bracketed. In (491), when the bracketing changes from the whole
sentence to the complement, the meaning is significantly different.


(491) a.   Moses yo ki gado do an                  kra su Barbarina o       nde.
           Moses NEG say earlier that 3so marry with Barbarina again NEG
           'Moses did not say earlier that he would marry Barbarina again.'

     b. Moses ki gado do an              yo kra su Barbarina o        nde.
        Moses say earlier that 3so NEG marry with Barbarina again NEG
        'Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.'

In a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of
negation by the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles
can move around to bracket the subject or the predicate or other parts of the
sentence. Examples are found in Schachter (1 985:60). However word order is
not rigid as it is in kbun. In Hausa both particles can move to bracket the
constituent that is being negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the scope as
well as the focus of negation. Abun's use of the linked particles is not as
flexible in that, for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked
pair of particles. However the subject may be included in the scope of negation
which is discussed in the next section.



8.5.2 Narrowing the scope of negation

Example (488) above does not specify which of the components within the
predicate are being negated. Was it not a wild pig killed? Was it not a killing?
Was it not at that location? All of these components are within the scope of
negation. To know which component is being negated one needs to refer to
the context of the discussion. Since negative sentences are rarely said in

isolation, that part which is being negated is usually known from the context.
                                                                       Abun negation 206




In English there are several strategies used to narrow the scope of negation to
the elements of the sentence or predicate that the speaker wants to negate.
These include the use of phonological devices such as emphatic stress, or
syntactic devices such as cleft constructions. So, for example, the use of
intonation to stress components of the sentence is a way to negate a
constituent as in, 'lsak did not eat the RICE [but the fish].' Or, 'Isak did not EAT
the rice [but he just swallowed it].'      Alternatively, or in addition, syntactic
features may be used to negate a constituent. Topicalisation, for example, is
used in English, 'It was not the rice that lsak ate.'


In the same way, Abun, like English, has some syntactic techniques that enable
us to focus on the negation of a certain part of the sentence. Essentially the
constituent to be negated needs to be bracketed by yo end nde. In order to
achieve this the predicate needs to be transformed so that only one constituent
is bracketed by the negative particles. As a result of limiting the scope of
negation, elements within the predicate are topicalised or relativised. The
scope can also be narrowed by a second use of the particle yo.


Firstly, by topicalising elements of the predicate the scope of negation is
narrowed. Topicalisation of an element removes such an element from the
scope of negation, thereby reducing the number of possibilities to which the
negation may apply. So, for example, if the wild pig in (492a), is topicalised, it
becomes (492b), meaning that either the action (killing) or the location fall
within the scope of negation. If then the location is likewise topicalised, as in
( 4 9 2 ~ the
          ) ~ result is that either the action or the object fall within the scope of
negation. Also it is possible to front both the object and the location, thereby
effectively narrowing the scope of the negation to the action alone.         Thus in
(492d), the wild pig near the Nai river is under discussion and lsak did not kill it,
he must have done something else to it.

                     'By the Nai river, lsak did not kill a wild pig.'

            d.       Nok      ga mo syur Nai de               ne lsak yo gu nde.
                     wild.pig REL LOC water Nai bank DET lsak NEG kill NEG
                     '(Concerning) a wild pig that was by the Nai river, lsak did not kill
            (it).'

    Secondly, in order to narrow the scope of negation to the modifier of a noun
    head of the subject, the predicate of the sentence may be relativised to become
    embedded within the subject position, with the modifier becoming the negated
    predicate. Take, for example, the modifier of the head of the noun phrase,
    rnwa 'many', in (493a). Sentential negation of (493a) is shown in (493b). But
    to narrow the scope of negation to the constituent, mwa, a structural change is
    made to form (493c), where the item to be negated, rnwa alone is bracketed by
    yo and nde. To achieve this the predicate of (493b) is relativised to become
    part of the subject and rnwa is predicativised and negated with the linked pair
    of negative particles, as in (493~).


    (493)   a.        Pa        mwa it            mo kelas gri
                      children many go.up LOC grade three
                      'Many children went up to grade three.'

            b.        Pa        mwa yo           if      mo kelas gri  nde.
                      children many NEG          go.up LOC grade three NEG
                      'Many children did not go up to grade three.'

            c.        Pa        ga    it  mo kelas gri          ne    yo    mwa nde
                      children who rise LOC grade three DET NEG many NEG
                      'The children who went up to grade three were not many.'
                                                                      Abun negation 208




Finally, the scope can also be narrowed by the use of yo a second time in the
sentence to intensify or emphasise the negation thereof, compare (494a) to
(40b, c and d). This second use of yc. is limited to occasions when it precedes

the verb mo 'to exist'.


(494)   a. Men yo      ku     an    mo nde.
           1PL NEG meet ~ S G exist NEG
           'We have not ever met him.' or 'We have never met him.'

        b. Men ku     an     yo      mo nde.
           1PL meet ~ S G NEG exist NEG
           'We have met him, never.' or 'We have never met him.'

        c. Men yo      ku     an  nde.
           1PL NEG meet ~ S G NEG
           'We have not met him.'

        d. Men yo      ku     an    yo      mo nde.
           ~ P L NEG meet ~ S G NEG exist NEG
           'We have not met him, never.' or 'We have NEVER met him.'

In Abun the use of topicalisation, fronting and relativisation of predicates or part
thereof, or a second use of yo to narrow the scope of negation to focus on or
emphasise one constituent of a sentence is not very common. In most cases
the constituent being negated is understood from the context, obviating the
need for such constructions.
