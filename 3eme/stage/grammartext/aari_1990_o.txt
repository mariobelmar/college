INTRODUCTION:

          With the exception of the Dime far to the west, the Aari ([?a:ri])

are the most northern speakers of a Southern Omotic language.       Although

some Aaris do live down in the lowlands, the majority inhabit the plateau

and scarplands of the lofty southwest spur of the Gemu-Gofa highlands

within the administrative territory of the Bako-Gazar warada.       According

to Haberland (p.420. in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known

as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and

Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000 1 •     Although the   high~

land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple

foodstuff is insat, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their

preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an      ~nsut    -

based culture is an adopted     one (ibid.,   421).   Those Aari who inhabit

the scarplands grow maize and sorghum varieties and keep small herds and

flocks.

          Apart from classificatory studies utilising basic vocabulary the

language of the Aari (which is also called [?a:ri])        has remained

completely undescribed.     The present paper is an attempt to begin to fill

this gap by putting on record a tentative analysis of some aspects of the
                                        426



 phonetics, phonology, and grammar of the language.      The material on which

 my analysis is based was collected in Addis Ababa during two to three weeks

 of research conducted in the months of July and November 1984.      My sole

 informant and assistant in this research was Ato Aynalem Tsegaye, an

 Aari-speaking      student at Addis Ababa University.   I acknowledge with

 gratitude the conscientious commitment of time and energy that Ato Aynalem

 gave to our research programme.     For their encouragement and practical

 helpfulness, I wish also to acknowledge here my indebtedness to the staff of

 the Addis Ababa University Institute of Language Studies where the research

 took place.

         In view of the altitude and environment range over which the Aari

 are found, and on account of the fact that their homesteads are widely

 separated (ibid., 420), it would not be surprising if their language

 showed some dialectal differences (cf. Fleming 1976b: 310).     My informant

 was of the opinion that the Aari speech of the highlands shows an Ometo

 (Gofa ?) influence and that the "purest" language is that spoken on the

 s c arplands.   I have been very fortunate in having h?d access to the

 valuable manuscript collection of Aari vocabulary, phrases and paradigms

 recorded by Bende r and Tully in 1973-74.    I expre s s here my deep gratitude

 to   Lionel Bende r for making these data available to me.    Comparison of

 this material with my own does inde ed show some variations, and at certain

 points in this study I draw attention t o the se; but my informant and the

 men who worked with Bender and Tully were a ll born close to Jinka, and it

 is quite clear that they speak essentially the same language.      It would be

 very inte resting , however, to see how f ar their variety differs from the

 speech of, say, the Ga lila, much f arthe r to the north.

§1.1.         CONSONANTS:

              The consonant phonemes of Aari are set out in the following table.

                                             Table 1

                                                                   t                                   c            k         q

              The notes which follow relate to the occurrence and the phonetic

realisation of the consonant phonemes.

1.            f        is frequently> though not always, pronounced as a bilabial

              fricative, viz. [~]

2.            The place of articulation for t                                                                 and d is dental> though for                 d'

              it is post-alveolar.

 3.           The voiceless non-uvular plain stops ( t,                                                                     s,      ~,    k) are aspirated

              fairly strongly in syllable-initial position.                                                                          This feature is an

              especially useful cue for distinguishing t he affricated plain stops

              from their glottalized counterparts.

4.            The affricated glottalized stops                                                                ( s' and        c' )       are ejectives.      d'
              is an implosive stop with fairly full voicing .                                                                            p'   is a lso implosive,

              but is largely devoiced - entirely so                                                                     when it is word-final, e.g.

                                        fee[cf]ay                                        use"less             [ cf] umi            darkness
                                        [p]6yka                                          keep .'             ro[p]                 "light

5~   s    and      s'   are asibilated affricated stops, i.e., [ t~h]                  and

     [t~'] respectively.               The only recorded instances of a voiced

     affricated stop for this series, i.e., [dz),             -        straddle morpheme

     boundaries, and are clearly phoneme sequences, e.g.

     gur[ctz]it             I built a fence        ( /gurd-s-i t/), cf. gurda

     fence

6.   c, J, c-, ,
     v     -
                        s    and   z   have a palato-alveolar place of articulation,

     and correspond to IPA              [ f1h] ,   [ ~] ,   [ f1   '] , [ J]   and [ t] respect-

     ively.       Of the five      J    is decidedly rare.         It occurs in loans such

     as   s 'a [ d:t] i      mead and [ ~] :immarka begin.'              Its occurrence in

     ma[~]i bZister and                 gu[~]ka add to!, the native status of
     which there is no reason to doubt, requires that it be considered
                        2
     as a phoneme             [d2] also occurs in certain verb forms, but in all

     except the case of guJ'-              add to, it is probably best seen as the

     surface realisation of a two consonant sequence (see §2.7.1.2.).

7.   q    has a uvular place of articulation 3 .               In terms of the phonological

     pattern of the language it probably "fills the gap" for a

     glottalized stop in the velar series.                   Nevertheless, phonetically

     it is a uvular, and definitely not glottalized in any way.                        Before

     consonants it is generally realised as a plosive, and word-initially

     as either a plosive or an affricate.                   Following a continuant it

     c onnnonly has a fricative pronuncia tion, and inte rvocalically it may

     even be voiced, e.g.

               p'o[q]si.t I t hought /desir ed; ?al[q]sek they t alked;

               [ q] aare - [ qx] aare vew e t monkey; w6se [X] e - w6se [15] e
               w6s e [q] e it gav e of f a sme H; s6[X]a - s6[H)a - s6[q]a

               horn;    soo[X] - soo(q] saZt
8.   n    has a wide r ange of preconsonantal pronunciations, e.g.
i
                                               431



              dental:    ?u[n]tin rat; alveolar:            ge(n]zi duik e r;
                          "
              palato-alveolar:      yi[r:i]~'ka        laugh/_; velar:    sufl)]gul:l

              flies; uvular:      fa[N)   q~    frog

         However, even morpheme-internally, as in the case of a word like

         ba[m]bara r ed pepper, it would not be reasonable to propose an

         archisegmental analysis of preconsonantal nasals (cf. the analysis

         of Zayse nasals in Ch. Four), since the pronunciation of nasals is

         not always predictable in this position, e.g.

              w6o [ n] sit    I worked     vs.       ?6[m]ssit I loaded

                              pinch!       vs.       ka[m]ka        pick up!

         The corpus contains only one instance of              [I)) not preceding a

         velar, viz. zo[lJ] ?i -       zo[m] ?i animal blood.            In view of the

         related verb forms (e.g. z6[m] ?se he bled, etc.) this velar nasal

         has clearly to be regarded as a surface realisation of m.

    9.   One of the more interesting features of Aari phonology emerges in

         connection with     h.   As a clearly delimitable segment, h             (which is

         pronounced as [ft] ) is rather unconnnon.           [fi]   has been recorded

         intervocalically in words such as:

              wa[fi]a meat; le[fila pumpkin; da[h]isit                    I   chased

         However, many words contain vowels with a distinctly breathy or

         nunnured quality.    The vot.iels in the preceding examples have this

         quality, viz.    w[~n~],      l[§ft~],      d[f!.h!]sit.    Moreover, every word

         in which an intervocalic [fi}         appears, can also be pronounced with-

         out such a segment.      Thus, in the case of the three words cited we

         could have     w[ ~-:] , 1 [ ~~] and        d[ n.j] sit.    It would appear that

         h   is on    the verge of disappearing from the language, though not
                                                                           4
         without leaving a trace of itself in the form of breathy phonation

         lt is not the case, however, that an [n) (as a possible realisation

of underlying h ) can be substituted in every word where breathy vowels

occur.       Thus, breathy vowels occur in all the word forms deriving from

such verb stems as

         [~:)d- come;             [~)ss- chop; k[§:)z-              t eU;    [~)?s-"

         tear (tr.J;           c'[~:]q-         curs e; w[g:]l-         f ee l, t ouch

In these and many other similar words my informant never pronounced an [fi],

nor would he accept pronunciations containing one.                           It was noted that
                                                                                                     ..,
breathy phonation was especially common in vowels in the environment of z

and Y,          e. g.

         g [ ~:]    z-     get drunk;         q [ ~:)    z-    become cold; f [ ! ]   z-   create;

         [~] z-         become sick;       y[   ! ] z-    hate; y [ ! ) r-      become startled;

         y [ ~] d-        sei ze;     y [i] n~i         child

though it is unlikely that too much significance should be attached to

this, since as well as the occurrence of many items containing breathy

phonation in which            y     and   ~     do not appear, there are also many items

containing        y or    z   where there is no breathy phonation.

         Words which do not commence with some other consonant have either

a glottal stop onset or breathy phonation.                        It is of further interest that

if a high tone is assoc iated with the first vowel of a word, and that fir s t

vouel is brea thy, the high tone will be realised as a rise.                          This i .s especiall y

clear in the c a se of long vowels.                 If the first vowel is breathy but has non-

high tone, the actual pitch sounds lower than it would be if it occurred on
                                               . i on 5 , e.g.

               Provided an [ fi]    actually appears, if only in a variant pronunc-

iation of a word, it would seem reasonable to represent that word as having

a / h /phonologically.             But in all other_cjis_es, where the breathy phonation

feature of a vowel appears to be independent (insofar as an alternative

pronunciation with a distinct [fi]              segment is not possible), there seems to

be no alternative but to set up an extra series of breathy vowel phonemes.

Throughout the remainder of this study such vowels will be indicated (by

means of diaresis) everywhere, except when they occur in juxtaposition to

an h,            since in this position such vowels are predictable.        Further

research may provide the key to a more satisfactory analysis.

               1be occurrence of independent breathy vowels in Aari acquires a

further dimension of significance in view of the fact that another South

Omotic language, namely Hamer, exhibits vowel harmony phenomena based on

two sets of vowels (Lydall 1976: 397ff) .              One of the phonetic properties of

Hamer vowels belonging to Lydall's "Category II" is . said to be an advanced

tongue root position, and what I have here called breathy phonation is a

common concomitant of this feature in many languages.                I was unable to

observe any vowel harmony processes at work in the utterances of my

informant, but it would be rash to reject such a possibility until consider-

ably more work has been done.


§ 1. 2.        VOWELS:

               The basic vowel system comprises five terms, viz.       i, e, a, o,

and       u.        When single the pronunciation of i       and u are close to those

of Cardinal Vowels 1 and 8 respectively.               Single a   is low, but between

Cardinal Vowels 4 and 5.             Single o    is nearer to a half-open than a half-

close tongue position.             Single   e is half-open and has a very centralised

pronunciation when it occurs either in a closed syllable or word-finally,

even in the environment of "palatal" consonants.              This makes it quite easy
          "   '   •   •        ~          -   '   •   1   •   •    -             ~   -   · _   -     '    •        '   •   ,   ~   -   ..   _..




                                                                  434



to mistake it for a lax version of                                a, e.g.
                          g[u]dr[f] hyaena; ?[!]mb[i] bushbuck, d[~]ng[?lr
                          elephant; d[2Jq[u]nt[1] stool,;                      q[~]s[e]/[&] hwnan

                          blood; ?[i]s[a]rs[e]/[a] it burned;                                  t[~]Gc[a]/[e]
                          he cut

In addition to this overlap in the pronunciations of e and                                                    a   it will be

noted in latter sections that many morphemeshavefree variant forms, one

with     a, one with e.

          Whether or not the articulation of the breathy vowels involves

tongue root advancement (with the concomitant invalidation of the Cardinal

Vowel technique for assessing tongue height) is not known, but the longer

duration of the breathy vowels seems to make them more like double non-

breathy vowels with respect to that part of their quality which must depend

on vocal tract shape.                    It should be noted that a breathy congener for the

high back vowel                    u   (or uu )has not been recorded: though our investigations

are as yet of too preliminary a nature to attach much weight to this fact.


§1. 3.    LENGTH:

          Intervocalically differential duration has been found for a number

of consonants.                 However, the only recorded cases of most of the geminate

consonants occur in morphologically complex forms, and are obviously the

result of consonant assimilation across morpheme boundaries (see§ 2.7.1.2.

and §2.7.2.4.).                    The consideration of morpheme-internal contrasts suggests

that underlying gemination is far less common.                                    The following single :

geminate contrasts (though the environments of contrast are never quite

identical) are all morpheme-internal.

         Differential duration of vowels is phonemic in many words, though

apparently not in word-final position.                              As in the case of the consonants,

durationally longer vowels are interpreted as double vowels.                                           Once again

the examples cited do not show contrasts in environments that are fully

identical, though it is very probable that exact minimal pairs could be

found.

It will be recalled that no instances of high back breathy vowels have been

recorded, but in the case of the other breathy vowels I have not been able

to establish length contrasts.          Impressionistically the high front breathy

vowel seems short, and I have written it with a single vowel letter in all

cases.   The mid vowels commonly sound longer in open syllables, and shorter

in closed syllables.       Word-initially mid breathy vowels again give the

impression of being long.          But I must emphasize that no clear phonological

contrasts have come to light.          Throughout this study this indeterminacy has

been indicated by writing all instances of mid breathy vowels as                       ~(~)   and

§1. 4.    PHONOTACTI CS:

          In the matter of consonant sequences Aari presents something that is

quite marked as far as the languages of S. Ethiopia are concerned, since it

has sequences of three, and even four, consonants .                                                    However, it appears that

in this language (cp. the statements made concerning Zayse in Chapter Four)

the structure of words can be accounted for in terms of combinations of

syllables conforming to a generalised canonical form (C)V(V/C)(C)(C).                                                                               In

this not-too-precise formulation the notation "V/C" is used to capture the

fact that although syllables of the form (C)VV(C) and (C)VCC(C) occur,                                                                                there

are none having the form (C)VVCC(C).                                 It is also the case that when a syllable

does close with a sequence of two or three consonants, the first of these is
                 6
always a sonorant •         It is also the case that wherever a sequence of three
                                                                \
consonants occurs syllable-finally, the last consonant is either s                                                                          or       s.
These phonotactic facts are most simply interpreted in terms of a syllable

structure template which gives recognition to distinct nucleus and coda con-

stituents.     The cooccurrence constraints are incorporated as positive

conditions on the structure of the nucleus and coda, viz.

          A further condition governing the structure of the nucleus is that

if the righthand (ie. the (+sonorant]) segment is (+vocalic], it will either

be identical to the preceding segment (in which case it will be interpreted

as a double vowel, as in Diagram 2) or it will be [+high], and so interpreted

as a glide, as in Diagram 3.

This means that the language has neither sequences such                       ae, eo, ue, etc.,

nor the sequences iy, uw.

         It is worth repeating the point made earlier (cf. § 1.1., 9.), that

in the only cases where a syllable occurs without an onset consonant the

nucleus contains a breathy vowel.              As the template of Diagram 1 indicates,

onsets are simple; indeed, the only one clear instance of a complex onset

that has been recorded OCCUrS in the Amharic loanword qWailS                        I   a   dried meat•

In rapid speech there is a tendency for unstressed vowels to syncopate when

preceded or followed by r ;           and where a pretonic vowel is                ~ropped,      a

complex onset is created, e.g.

             burukse     it boiled        -+    b[ ur] kse

             birazen the future           +     [   br] azen

               It should not be assumed from the preceding account that all logically

 possible consonant sequences are in fact tolerated, and there are a number

 of morphological alternations witnessed in verbs (see §2.7.1.2. and §2.7.2.4.)

 which suggest that certain sequences created in morpheme combinations are

 avoided by the operation of phonological processes; but how far the sequences

 that are circumvented in this way represent sequences that are cubject to

  fully general negative phonotactic constraints that operate both within and

  across morpheme boundaries i s not clear; though it seems likely that this

  would be the case.

 §1.5.         ACCENT:

               It is clear from words uttered in isolation that there is one, but

 one only, high pitched syllable per word.                                                     This fact suggests that the language

 has an accentual system, rather than a tonal one.                                                                  The function of accent

 location appears to be lexical in nouns, but grammatical in verbs.

               Accent seems usually to occur on the ultimate syllable in trisy llabic

 and     consonant~final                 disyllabic nouns, e.g.

                        ~zim          sickness ; dang6r elephant ; 'luntin rat ; ?isin f ood

                        fatir          maize ; sungula                            fli es ; doqunti                           stool;

                        qundula              hump (cattle); balasa                                              ' two- pronged hoe;

                        noqorti              viscera

 but there are some exceptions to this, e .g .

                       wiik sak           jackal ;            b ark6ta headrest-cum- stool;

                        doqs int i           diarrhoea

 The majority of vowel-final disyllabic nouns also seem to have the accent

 finally, e.g.

                        qan tf            testicles; sis' 1 hair;                                     bezi beehive;

                        ki?i          husband ; duuki                          grave ; moore ne ighbour

 but there are also a good many where it is penultimate, e .g.
                                       440


             ?arf i   moon, month;    leesi   corpse;   s6nqa kiss;

             buudi    chest, heart;   ?aksi   dog
         In the case of verbs, accentual placement varies according to the

paradigm concerned, and could therefore be regarded as a part exponent of

the category (categories) expressed in that paradigm.      All verbs behave

uniformly in these matters, i.e., there are no lexically governed differences,

e.g.

             ?l.k-ta He has pierced;     ? ik-kl.   He has not pierced;

             ?ik-ay     He wiU not pierce; ?ik kl. ?ikeno Let him pierce!


§ 2.     GRAMMAR:



§2 .1.   NOUNS:

         Leaving aside any morphologically complex nouns, (for which      see

§2.1.1.), there are, with regard to canonical form, two main types of noun:

those ending in vowels, and those ending in consonants.      There is justification

for regarding vowel-final nouns as bipartite in structure, and that the terminal

vowel (TV) is to a certain extent independent of the root, which comprises

everything to its left.     Consonant-final nouns consist solely of a root.

Justification for considering the TVs as an independent, albeit lexically

determined, element relies upon the following facts.      Firsly, in certain

morpho-syntactic configurations the TVs of some nouns may be replaced by

some other formative.     It should be stressed, however, that only a minority

of nouns exhibit such behaviour (the details appear in §2.1.1.).      There is

also the fact that where we find cognate noun : verb pairs, then the TV,

which appears only in the noun, has obviously to be regarded as a distinct

element, e.g.
                                                     441



      noun                                      verb - various forms

                       cold{ness)               q~z-ay                it did not get cold

      ses'e            day                      ses'-ta               it became morning
       ,,.
      sonqa            k i ss                   s6nq-se               he/she kissed sb

      d'umi            darkness                 d'um-se               it got dark

      gurda            f ence                   gurd-ka               build a fence!

      soose            roasted grain            s6os-ta               he/she roasted grain

      sis'i            saliva                   sis ' -da             he/she spits through

                                                                      the teeth

      t6oni            faece s                  t6on-seqe             he/she defecated

Finally, some further evidence for this view is provided by a few nouns which

show variability with regard to the TV, e.g.

                 qaar~       -qaarfl. vervet monke y; gOs -            gos1 barley;

                 leha - lehi pumpkin; zerga - zergi wheat

       Elsewhere I have argued on comparative grounds that TVs have to be

posited for Proto-North Omotic , and now the fact that such elements also

turn up in Aari, which belongs to South Omotic, required us to recognise

the feature as being of Proto-Omotic                   origin (see Hayward, 1iS7).

       There are three TVs:           i, e and a.               The following are typical V-

final nouns.

       TV    -   i :      debi wild animal; nuki nose; norti be lly; tuud 'i

                         butt ocks;    q6r~'     i      t hroat, l arynx; duuti l eg, foot

       TV - e :           qose    f or est;     ~' oore         cow-dung;   ~~qe   t r ee, wood;

                          diire    gr ass;      ?ak~ e     ske lit;   bur~e    maize- cob;

                          ?oole     pi t, hole

       TV -      a:       muqa    egg; ful ta door, doorway; noqa water; moosa

                         f ood prepared f rom          ~nsat;    s usa relative; ?ila

                         f lour; qasa         Lous e

       The following are typical consonant-fina l nouns .
                                           442



      ? indap I   8   brother>; Seeger Side, p!'OXimity;     gider inside,

      middle; gaamet mongoose; r§(g)r daytime; bon dry season,

      year;     taw     Lie; ?eed man, person

      It appears that no consonant-final noun has more.than two syllables,

and indeed, the only      simpl~   nouns extending to three syllables are those in

which the third syllable LS a TV.         From this we extract the generalisation

that nominal roots never exceed two syllables in length.            It should be

added, moreover, that monosyllabic roots are by far the most numerous (cf.

the similar statement concerning verbs in §2.7.1.1.).


§2.1.1. NOMINAL INFLECTION:

      So far we have considered only the citation form of a noun, but the

actual morphological form of a noun will depend upon its categorization

wLth respect to a number of features.        Although Aari nominal inflection

actually seems to follow a very logical system, that system is of a rather

unusual type for Ethiopian languages, and initially it may appear somewhat

confusing, especially with regard to the interaction of "plural" and

definiteness.
                                                                7
      Leaving aside the genitive (for which see §2.1.2.)            the four

parameters affecting noun inflection are: species (= definiteness), case,

number, and gender.      Of these, species is of primary significance, since

unless a noun is marked as definite, none of the other categories are ever

marked, i.e., the noun will appear in the citation form.            It is necessary

too to appreciate the fact that certain inherent semantic features of the

noun itself will determine whether it is possible for it to be inflected

for number or gender.      Thus, it is only possible to distinguish number

categories Ln nouns which are inherently [+countable], and it is only

possible to distinguish gender categories Ln nouns which are inherently

[+animate]; moreover, a positive value for the second of these features

naturally implies a positive value for the first.          This means that a mass
I

                                                  443




    noun can only inflect for species and case, and, of course, for the latter

    only if it is definite with respect to the former.

           Each of the four parameters comprises just two categories.           In the

    case of species and case, it is appropriate to speak of marked (definite

    and accusative) and unmarked (indefinite and non-accusative) categories.

    In the case of a mass ([-countable]) noun, which presents the simplest

    situation, definite is marked by means of a suffix -in(a/e) - n(a/e).

    The alternant with initial i           occurs with consonant-final nouns, and the

    variants with a final       a or       e   are only obligatory when the accusative

    suffix is added.     In direct object function the head of a definite NP
        .              .                8
    receives an accusative su ff"1x . -m •        For mass nouns then, there are just

    three distinct forms morphologically; an unmarked indefinite form, a form

    terminating in -n(a/e) - -in(a/e), which is definite and non-accusative,

    and a form terminating in -nam -           -inam 9 , which is both definite and

    accusative.   These forms are illustrated in the following sentences.

           fatir doqa

           There is maize
           fatirin (-fatirina) miqse

           The maize has finished
           fatir ziigdit

           I want maize
           fatirinam ziigdit

           I want the maize
           ?ans'ina laqmi-ye

           The honey is good
           ?ans'i laqmi ~~feriy

           Good honey is not obtainable
                ... . ~ ?1,, [ t·s
           b als1nam           "'"'h] ek

           They ate the inJar.·a
                                         444



        With [+countable] nouns the category of number becomes relevant.

According to the present analysis, Aari does not really have a marked plural

form.   Instead there is a marked singulative or individuated category,

which stands opposed to an unmarked generic or class-denoting category.

The singulative category is in general marked by a suffix -s, which attaches

directly to the noun stem, and so precedes the definite suffix, which is,

of course, obligatory.     Since the singulative forms can only refer to one

individuated item, it is not surprising that the unmarked non-singulative

definite carries with it some sense of plurality, so that in the case of

[+countable] nouns informants will give this form as a "plural", and in
                                                                 10
subject function such a form may require plural verb agreement        Thus, for

such nouns we have at least five forms:

        1.   unmarked indefinite forms

        2.   definite, non-singulative, non-accusative forms*

        3.   definite, non-singulative, accusative forms*

        4.   definite, singulative, non-accusative forms

        5.   definite, singulative, accusative forms

        (Forms marked with an asterisk may be interpreted as "plurals".)

These are exemplified in the following sentences.

        tiile ctoqa

                               -
        There is a water-pot or A water-pot is present
        tiile sen[J]tit
        I have bought a uxxter-pot
        tiilena doqak
        The uxxter-pots are present
        tiil es:ln ?ayse

                tiilesinfun sen[fJtit
                I   have bought the water-pot
                There is natural gender only, which in the case of Aari means that

      only those nouns which are inherently [+female] can ever be marked as

      feminine morphologically.         Feminine is marked only in singulative forms,

      where a -ta suffix replaces the -s           suffix of . the general non-feminine
               11
      gender        , e.g.

               ?anza doqa
               There is a girl or A girl is present
                ?anzana doqak


                ?anzanfun se[d·3]it-
               The girls are present

               keta ?anza ziziigdek
               They want a girl
               ?anzitan ?ef?eefda
               The girl is weeping

               n§(~)         ?anzitanfun n~[J~]e
               He loved the girl
               baa~ena         doqak
               The hens are about
               baacitan de?se
               The hen died

               baacitanfun        d!;(~)ski

               He did not kill the hen
               There is no corresponding morphological mark for nouns that are

      semantically [+animate, -female], i.e., nouns denoting male animals.          The

      singulatives of these are non-distinct from those of other [+countable]

      nouns, e.g.
                                           446



        ?angsin de?se
        The male died

        nood'isin    §.~de

        The leopard came
                        ,,.......   .
        mayksinam se[d·3J~(~)te
        We saw the buffalo
        b~~bfsinam      ziziigdek
        They want the chief
        Certain ( +a:nimate] nouns such as ?eed man, person, waaki cattle,

derti     sheep, etc. seem to be (±female], since they appear with feminine
or non-feminine singulative forms.


§2.1.2. THE GENITIVE CONSTRUCTION:

        The genitive construction has the order genitive NP - Head.             The

final constituent of the possessor NP takes a        -t(a/e) suffix.          Although

this genitive suffix shows a certain degree of homophony with the feminine

singulative suffix (cf. §2.1.1.), it always follows the definite suffix,

whereas the latter precedes it.         As some of the following examples show,
                                                                     12
definiteness in the genitive and head NPs varies independently            •    As

would be expected, accusative marking occurs only on the head NP.               Some

examples are the following.

        ?eedte naam1 ga?s[el                             ?eed-te

           The genitive suffix is absent in some noun + noun expressions,

  though the possessor first order of the genitive construction seems to be

  observed.           Perhaps such expressions should be regarded as compounds, e.g.

§2.2.    PRONOUNS :


§2.2.1. PERSONAL PRONOUNS:

          The basic seven-fold set of unaffixed pronominal stems is as follows.

                       ls            ?i               lp          w~(?,)

                       2s            ~a               2p          y~


                       3s.m          kl
                                     k615

                       3s.f

Such minimal forms occur immediately before various dependent clause verb

forms, where they function to distinguish the subject, for, unlike main

clause verbs, dependent clause verbs do not usually contain subject agree-

ment ma rkers.     They a ppear, for example, in subordinate c l auses (cf. §2 . 7.4.)

such as the following.

                 ?i diib[z]inka
                 i f I s t eal ...
                 aa woonki nk        . .

                                           449



It should be noted, however, that if a subject pronoun occurs independently,

these preverbal pronouns will not also occur, thus:


                 --          --
                 aana ?im ye(e)ksink ?ita         aam
                                                  --       --
                                                          ye(e)kter
             If you insult me, I shall insult you
The significance of the variants         nQ(Q) (3s.m) and        naa (3s.f), which may
occur in such clauses (and are the only possible forms in certain syntactic

contexts considered below)         is not yet clear.    These basic pronoun forms

also appear preverbally in relative clauses (cf. §2.7.3.), e.g.

                 [?i ziig[z]eqinda ziigin]             ~i?[J]e

             The goods that I wanted arrived
                 [ki naskinda re~] maa[~h]e
             A thing which he did not like happened
                 [w§Cg) bookten ?001enJ noqok s'o[M'Je
             The pit which we have dug has filled with water
Pronouns of this type occur also in the "complex paradigm" of the jussive

(cf. §2.7.2.2.), e.g.

             de? kl. de?en
             Let him die!
        To the very limited extent that they have been investigated it

appears thatrelational postpositions (cf. §2.8.) follow pronominal forms

of this type, e.g.

                 ?uutu giininam ?i kan teyye
             Uutu took the butter for me
             ~~       kan ?isin ?imsit
             I    gave food to you
             ?i-rank kayye
             He went away from me
             kl. re     ?,.~dite

             I    came to him
                                                450



        A set of object pronouns is furnished by suffixing the accusative

marker -m   to the foregoing forms, viz.

                    ls             ?1.m                 lp      WQ(Q)m
                    2s             ~P,.rn               2p       y~(~)m

                    3s.f           k§(g)m
Attention is directed to the 3s.f and 2p forms here, for they appear with

breathy vowels.     I have no explanation for this.

        As heads of independent NPs in subject or nominal predicate function

we find the following set of pronominal forms.               Most of them are derived by

suffixation of    -ta16 , viz.
                    ls            ?itA                lp      wg(g)ta

                    2s            ~?,.nA              2p      yet a

                    3s.m          ng(g)
                                                      3p      keta
                    3s.f          n~~

Some examples of subject, nominal predicate and object pronouns are seen

in the following sentences.

             keta        y~(~)m    ba[f:]eqek
             They    ove~came     you(p)
             yeta kim merkayet
             You (p) did not he l p hi m

             .... galta
             aana
             You are an old man

             n§(g)       ga?se
             He is big

             n~~    kQ(Q)m y!z y!zda
             She hates her


             We like you

             kuur     ~~qseqinda            ng(Q) -ye
                                         451


              He is the one who spent the day here
              p'a!§kinda yete
              You(p) are the ones who were not frightened


              We are the ones who were areated


(For a possible explanation of the vowel change seen in the pronouns in the

last two examples, see §2.6.).

         The reflexive direct object pronouns are composite items which

transparently derive from a construction consisting of a possessive determiner

+ mata head    + accusative   -m,     viz.

             ls      ?imatam                      lp       w6(g)matam
             2s      ?.,~at am                    2p       y~(~)matam

             3s.m    kfmatam}
                                    y!matam       3p       kematam
             3s.f    k6matam
                                                    .                    17
The form yimatam     is neutral with respect to the sex of the antecedent •

Some examples are as follows:

              ?ita ?imatam gi?sit
              I hit myseZ.f
              n§(g) y!matam (-kimatam) ?es?esda
             He knows himself

              ~~na ~~atam ~edday

             You see yourself

§2.2.3. DEICTIC PRONOUNS:

        The two deictic pronouns koone ;:.,, koona      this, that, these, those

and   keene - keena these, those have straightforwardly to be identified
with the deictic determiners (see §2.3.2.).       In direct object function the

more general form (koone - koona) shows that i t has a composite structure,

for the acc usa tive suffix -m      is seen to replace the ending.   The same
                                       452



conclusion would be reached from a consideration of genitive NPs containing

deictic determiners, for in these the genitive suffix attaches directly to

the determiner stem koo-; see §2.1.2.        (My data contain no evidence for

this analysis in the case of keene - keen a.)       A few eKamples of the pronominal
(i.e., head role) of these deictics are given here, but others appear else-

where in this study.

             koone ?aksi
             This/that is a dog
             koone toyla dakki
             This/that is not a fish
             wg(g)te kg(g)m teyyg(g)t
             We took this/that one

             ~(~)n ~~nt    koone
             Your house is this/that one

             keen~     c'elmi-ye
             These/those are blaak

             wg(g)ta keenem        n~sdg(g)t

             We like these/those

§2.2.3. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS:
        Possessive pronouns appear to be formed from one type of possessive

determiner (see§ 2.3.1.) by attachment of the definite suffix -n(a) - -n(e),

viz.

            ls            ?isten               lp       w9(g)nten
            2s            aanten               2p       yent~n

            3s.m          kitt~n
                                               3p       ketten
            3s.f         kg(g)tten
The following are some examples:

             ?isten (-?isten!l)       gaa~'da


            Mine is bett er
                                           453


             kettene s'eedi-ye
             Their's is short
             kittena c'elmi-ye
             His is bZaak
             koone yenten (-yentena)
             This/that is yours(p)

             ~~ntenem        ziigda
             He wants yours


§2.2.4. INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS:

        The following interrogative pronouns were recorded:

             ~y      who?;    ..amna     ..
                                       - amne which one?;        ~re   ?Jhat?;   meym how

             rrruch/many?; ~ynet ?Jhen?;         ~bir   ?Jhere?; !!-Snf ho?J?;    ar~   kan ?Jhy?

Three of these will be seen to be formally identical to the interrogative

determiners considered in § 2.3.3.

        One observation needs to be made with respect to clauses containing

interrogative pronouns. for it has been noted that whatever the person of

the clause subject the verb appears in an invariable form.              In the perfect

this form may be identified as the 3s perfect 1.           In the imperfect the form

found resembles the regular imperfect in containing the same -d                  formative,

but since the final vowel is an          e • it is not possible to identify the
form with the 3s imperfect (for the latter terminates in a ; see §2.7.2.2.)

Moreover, none of the instances recorded show any signs of reduplication.

For both perfect and imperfect there is an equally common and acceptable

alternative form terminating in -il.             These forms are illustrated with

de1 - die,    viz.

                         perfect:           de?se -     de?sik

                         imperfect:         de?de       de?dik

The basic personal pronouns (see§ 2.2.1.) occur with these verb forms when

the questioned constituent is a non-subject, though in the case of 3ms subjects
                                              454


the pronoun seems to be optional only (see the discussion of -ik             below).

The . feature of an invariable verb form suggests that the structure of content

question clauses could involve a cleft sentence, e.g.
                 ,
          ( a ) meym- k e 18   1§€mde (- 'Sendik)

               How many/rrruch wiLl they buy?

          (b) ~bir-~ kayde          <-     kaydik)

               Where are.you going?
What is curious, however, is the fact that replies appropriate to such quest-

ions (which would, one assumes, have the same focus structure) may not contain

the invariable verb form.         Thus, for (a) and (b) above appropriate answers

might be (a') and (b').

        (a')   qasten 1§endek
               They will buy two

        (b')   3 inka   kaydi t

               I am going to Jinka

Yet the possibility of a copula (or what was originally a copula) being involved

is enhanced by the fact that in cases where there is a 3ms subject, it is

common for a -ik     suffix to appear on the interrogative pronoun, and in

such cases the verb form can only have the -e            ending; so that it appears

that the two homophonous suffixes should be identified, e.g.

               iynetik ~~de -         ~ynet ~~dik -      aynet ~~de

               When ZJiU he aome ? ( **~ynetik         ~~dik)

               ..
               abirik doqde -         ..                 ..
                                      abir doqdik - abir doqde

               Where does he Live? or Wher e is he?
There is even one case where an otherwise unidentified -k             suffix appears

attached to a 3p pronoun, i.e.,

               abiran-ke k                     ~~d e

               Wher e ? - from - they -k        aame
               Where have they come from?
                                         455


Clearly there is here an interesting area for future research.      Further

examples of sentences containing interrogative pronouns are the following:

             ~re   naSde (- n~Sdik)
             What does he Like?
             meym-ko teyde (- teydik)

             How many will she take?
                                  . . . . . . . h] e)
             1re-ki maa~ik (- maa[t.s

             What happened?
             1snik 11de - 1sni 11dik
             How did he come?
             ~~n ~~nt ~na
                                        19
                                 deek

             Which one is your house?
             ~ynet-ko    de?de (- de?dik)

             When will she die?
             meym de?sik

             How many died?


             Who came?
             1yim-wg(g) ziigde (- ziigdik)
             Whom do we want?
             1yim-e ziigde (- ziigdik)

             Whom dQ you{p) want?
Comparison of the last three examples reveals that in object function         ~y


takes the accusative suffix     ~m;   this does not occur in the case of any

of the other interrogative pronouns.


§2.3.   DETERMINERS:


§2.3.1. POSSESSIVE DETERMINERS:

        The most general set of possessive determiners appears to have
                                          456



developed from a genitive NP construction, for each determiner consists of

a personal pronoun plus the genitive suffix (see §2.1.2.).                However, certain

morphological idiosyncrasies suggest that they have now to be regarded as

lexicalisations.      Each member of the set has a longer and a shorter form,

e.g.

           ls        ?iste, ?ist                lp      w2(9)nte, w9(g)nt
           2s        ~~nte,    ~~nt             2p          yente, yent

           3s.m      kitte, kit
                                                3p      kette, ket
          3s.f       k6tte, k6t
The shorter forms occur both preceding and following the head, though it

seems likely that when no other dependent elements are present, the latter

position is usual.      My informant claimed that when the determiner is placed

before the head, it imparts a contrastive force, especially in the case of

the longer form, which occurs only in this position, e.g.

                mata ?ist seeqda

                My head aahed/is unwell

                ~(~)n    kit ?aserse
                His house aaught fire

                b~~b~n    kitam ?essit

                b~eb ~~nt naami Calmayo
                                                                                              I

                k6t ?indap'sinta ~(~) se[d·~]~(~)t
                We saw her brother's house

                n§(g) k6t ?indanam Y![3·]e

                He hates her mother

                ?ist waaktenem diib[z]aqay
                You stole my aow

                ?iste waaki diib[z]aqay
                You stole MY aow
2                                                      -;.-;·-; :·---.   :t ·1Hmit6teft-· 5 · ;:i;·:~·~'t'1:t·.;,·;· ··   · ,..,,-,,..,,, · r   tnt#?tiii'tt1'   1




                                                 457


    For the pronominal function of these determiners in headless NPs, see §2.2.3.

            Aari expresses possessive predication (i.e., predications employing

    to have in English) by means of the locative-existential verb doq- (see
    §2.7.2.5.).   In such cases the entity possessed functions as head of the

    subject NP, and is obligatorily followed by a possessive determiner.                                                            When

    it is expressed, the possessor occurs sentence-initial, and since it too takes

    the nominative, it has probably to be regarded as having an appositional

    structure, e.g.

                  (?ita) maa ?ist doqa

                  I have a wife
                  (naa) tokmi ganzab k6t doqa
                  She has a Little money
                  (keta)       fe~a   bedmi ket doqa
                  They have much Land
                  ?anziten       koon~    ?innaani k6t doqa

                  That girl has a sister
                  (yeta) ?afla killa yent doqa
                  You(p)   have new clothes
                  ytn~i    wollaq ?ist doqa             ~~q

                  I had one child
                  laqami      m~~     kit doqa

                  He had a beautiful wife
            Attention is also directed to the fact that certain kin terms have

    special possessed forms, which appear to be used interchangeably with con-

    structions involving the regular noun form + possessive determiner described

    above, e.g.

                      kin term             possessed form

                      bfr~ba              baab                                          father

                                                              aunt
                     ?indap'si         ?indap's               brother
                     ?innll.an         7innaan                sister
Preposed possessive determiners which are formally similar to the basic

pronominal stem forms (see §2.2.1.) occur with these particular items, and

the initial ?i           sequence, which characterises most of them, is dropped, e.g.

             ?f-ba~b                    my father
             ke-b~H!·b                  their father

                                        his mother
             ~?.--ndap's               your brother
                                       our aunt
             ye-nnaan                  your(p) sister

It should be noted that other kin terms, such as ? irki              uncZe,   m~~   wife,
susa reZative, etc. do not have similar possessive forms.

§2.3.2. DEICTIC DETERMINERS:

        The most widely encountered and general deictic determiner is

koone - koona            t his, that, these, those.    The other item   keene - keena
seems to be restricted to use with noun heads that are semantically "plural"
                20
(see §2.1.1.)        •   As in the case of the posses s ive determiners, koone and

keene are found both preceding and following the head; though the l a tter
position is probably the basi c or unmarked one.          The following are some t y pical

examples of the use of these determiners; other examples a ppea r elsewhere in

the paper.

             ?isinin koone          ~'~la

             This/that grain is raw

             d'aakin koone s'eed'i-ye
             This/that rope is short

             yjnsi koone ?indap ' s kit doqa
             This/that boy has a brother

             ?eedin keen e (- koone) ?assaab ket laqruni-ye
             These/those people have a good idea
                                             459
               lit: These/those people, their idea is good

               ~(~)na    keena (- koone) ga?s[e]
               These/those houses are big
For the pronominal function of these determiners in headless NPs see§ 2.2.2.


§2.3.2. INTERROGATIVE DETERMINERS:

           Three interrogative determiners were recorded, viz.

              meym      how much/many?;     ?,.IDila -   amne   which?;   aY   whose?

e.g.

               dert1 ~nem ~~ ziigday
               Which sheep do you like?

               waaks1n       ~ne   ga?s[e]
               Which cow is bigger?

               koona    ~Y   .waaki
               Whose cow is this?

               waakl. meym doqa
               How many cows are there?

               ?eed meym      i}~de

               How many people came?
For the pronominal function of these determiners in headless NPs see §2.2.4.


§2.4.   ADJECTIVES:

        From the point of view of morphology there is often an indeterminacy

between adjectives and nouns, and it seems that some lexical items can function

as either.     A number of items that are usually adjectives semantically share

a suffix     -mi; and since for many of them we find verbs having cognate roots,
one might feel justified in regarding this suffix as an adjectival formative,

e.g.

               ?aymi broken, cf.            'lay- break (intr.)
               ?oyd' mi       hot, cf.      ?oyd' - become hot

               ?,.zmi   sick, cf.     az-     become sick

               bedm'i     many, much, cf. bed-            become many/much
                                              460

             tokmi        smaU, cf.        tok-      become small, decrease

             dees'ml.       heavy, cf. Maale              des'ene         heavy

             zeymf        red, ef. Maale            z6k'e         red

             zaazmf        wet, cold, cf.           zaaz-         become wet/cotd

             rggtmi        taU, (no cognates available)

There are, however, some nouns that look as if they contain the same suffix,

e.g.

              'laqmf      insclt; ? ikmi           pain    (cf.     ?ik-pierce, stab);

              'luqmi      thorn 21 ;        v
                                         ?uqsmi           cfow21

Moreover, in some instances ?oyd 'mi               and frzmi            (see above list) appear

to require translation as heat and sickness respectively.                         Thus, although

verb cognates have not been found in every case, it might be safer to conclude

that    -mi is simply a deverbative derivational suffix.
        Other items which function adjectivally (though not exclusively so

in every case) but which lack -mi are such as the following:

             ga?sa        big, fat, important;            s' eedi       short; killa     new;

             f   eeday     useless;        ?uE:s:i near (cf. ?us- become near);
                         cold (cf.       q~z- become cotd,              q~zi   wind);   c' ~la
                 raw, raw f ood:       s 'oos' i   fuU (cf.        s 'oos '-      become fuU)

        The behaviour of predicative adjectives with respect to the copula

-ye is treated elsewhere (see §2.6.).                 Some additional examples are given

here:

             goolena koona daqali-ye (- daqali)
             This beer is bad

             y~nsin      tokmi-ye (- tokmi)
             The ehiZd is small

        In the following the two final examples give evidence of agreement

between adjective and noun: at least in subject function

             ?anza laqami ~~de
             A beautiful. girl came

             d'aaki s' e edi ziigdite
                                         461

             wg(g)ta ?afla killa w§(g)nt             doq~

             we have new clothes
             gudri s'aami dakki-ye

             There are no white hyaenas
             Y!nsin tokmina         ~(~)fda

             The small child is crying
             galsi     ~'elmisin d~?se

             The black old man died

§2.5.   NUMERALS:

        The basic numerals are as follows:

             1     w6llaq                       7   tabza

             2      qasken (- qasten)           8   qask~n-tamars


             3     makkan                       9   wolqan-tamars

             4      ?oydi                      10   tanuna

             5      donq                   100      mat a (- mato)

             6      laa                   1000      siytt

The form for twenty could also be regarded as a basic numeral, for it differ;

from all the other numerals denoting multiples of ten, which are clearly

derivative, e.g.

             20     bonda                      60   laa-tam

             30 makkan-tam                     70   tabza-tam

             40     ?oydi-tam                  80   qasken-tamars-tam

             50     donq-tam                   90   wolqan-tamars-tam

The intermediate numbers are fomed straightforwardly, viz.

             11     tamma-wollaq (- tfunmollaq)

             12     tamma-qasten

            13      t amma-makkan

             26     bonda-laa

             41     ?oydi- tfun-wollaq

            253    mate qas ten donq-tfun-makkan

            428 mato ?oydi. bonda-qaske n-tamars
                                           462



          As attributive nominal quantifiers numerals always follow the head,

and when they are present, a deictic or possessive determiner will oblig-

atorily precede the head.       However, the data include cases where a numeral

is followed by a relative clause, e.g.

              derti wollaq doqa

               There is one sheep
               ?aksi d6nq s~[d~]it

               I

              keen~
                   sa?J five dogs
                        ?aksi d6nqinem §&[d·3]it  --
               I saw these five dogs
               ?ist (-?i) y!nsine makkanin ~a?[J]eqek

               My three children have arrived
               ?eedin ?oydin          ~~dten   doqak

              There are four people who have come
In many cases, especially in predicative function, numerals may stand alone,

e.g.



               We ?Jere six
              makkanin       §.~dek

               The three came
               keene makkaninem ziigdit

               I want these three

§ 2. 6.   COPULAR CLAUSES:

          Under certain circumstances an optional copular clitic -ye        may

appear in affirmative present tense/state nominal and adjectival predications.

Such occurrences seem to be possible only when the citation form of the

predicate noun or adjective has final accent.          If -ye   does not appear

(i.e., if it is optionally absent) or if it cannot appear (i.e., if the

predicate item has non-final accent in the underlying/citation form), the
                                             463


final predicate item is low-pitched. e.g.

                   koone y!nsi-ye (- ?yinsi)
                   That is a ahild                      cf.     y~ns1      child

                   tiilena ?oyd'mi-ye (- ?oyd'mi)
               The pot is hot                           cf.     ?oyd'mi       hot

                   kuur ~~qseqinda ?eed diib-ye
                   The man who passed the day here      ~s    a theif

                   wahana zeymf-ye (- zeymi)
                   The meat is red                      cf.     zeymi       red
but:               gusina killa
                   The calabash is new                  cf.     killa       new

                   koone ?aksi
                   This is a dog                        cf.     7 aks i     dog
           Cases like ga?sa big, fat, important and gal ta old man, old

are interesting, for although -ye            is not pronounced, variant predicative
                                   \
forms of these appear with a final high-pitched [e]                 e.g.

                   ?isten ga?~a (- ga?~[~])
                   Mine   is big

                   n§~?,) galta (- galt[e])

                   He is an old man    or   He is old
Such variant forms might well derive from underlying                /ga?Sa + ye/, /gal ta

+   ye/,    etc.
           The special set of kin terms discussed in §2.3.1. have their own

predicative forms with a final           e, e.g.

                   ?i-b~rnbe

                   It is my father

                   ~a-nnaane

                   It is your sister

                   ?eedten de?ten ki-ndaake

                   The woman who died is his mother
                                                464


          Negative present tense/state nominal and adjectival predictions

require dak- ,         an irregular verb that also serves in the negative of the

negative of the locative-existential verb doq-               (see § 2. 7. 2. 5.).   Many cases

have been noted in which the clitic -ye               attaches to the 3s form of dak-

e.g.

                  ?ita galta dakkit(e)
                  I am not an old man

                  koona toyla dakki (- dakki-ye)
                  This is not a fish

                  doobina       ga?~a   dakki {- dakki-ye)
                  The rain is not abundant
          Affirmative and negative past tense nominal and adjectival predications

employ    ~~q-        and    dakki-~~q-      respectively, e.g.

                  ?ita foliis ....
                              aaq(e)
                  I   ZJas   a soldier/poliaeman

                  n~~ m~~ laqami ~~q
                  She was a good woman

                  ?ita foliis dakkit-~~q
                  I   ZJas   not a soldier


                  He was not poor

§ 2. 7.   VERBS:


§ 2. 7 .1. VERB   STEMS:

          Verb stems may be simple or extended.           Extended-s tem (ES) verbs differ

from simple-stem (SS) verbs in having one or more derivational suffixes which

are associated with the formation of passive and causative verbs; simple-

stem verbs contain a root only.




                                                                                     . &ll.LL££&illl
                                            465


§2.7.1 . 1. SIMPLE STEMS:

        In the great majority of SS verbs the root is a monosyllable con-

forming to the canonical form for syllables in the language (see               § 1. 4.).

Some typical verb roots are the following:

              gob-      Jump;   bed-      become many/much;      woe:- become dry;

              a.z-     run, fly;       ?es- know;    ~a?-    aPrive ; book-      dig;

              y~(~)k-       i nsult;     ?oyd',... become hot;    ?ays- bPeak; ~ws-

               rest;     mang- hunt;      s 'uns-    pinch; sonq-      kiss;      ?oms-

               load;     gin?- fall asleep; ?ard-            enter'; 9,0l?- add to;

               ?alq- speak

        Apart from obvious loans such as          ?aroma~-    be lieve and J ammar-

  ~arnmar-    begin, only a handful of disyllabic SS verb roots were recorded,

and of these two are deadjectival derivatives.          Moreover, all of them have

monosyllabic alternants, and the second vowels of the disyllabic alternants

could probably be analysed as e penthetic insertions, viz.

              ?uugum- - ?uugm-              shout; bukul- - bukl-         slip down;

              laqam-        laqmi      become good (cf. laqamf. - laqmi good);

              daqal-        daql-      become bad (cf . daqali - daqli bad)
§2.7.1.2 . EXTENDED STEMS:

        The investigation of ES verbs was restricted to a consideration of

"passives" (derived intransitives) and "causatives" (both derived transit-:t"ves

and "true" causatives).      As far as these forms are concerned, the overall

picture i s a familiar one as far a s Ethiopian langua ges are concerned.                  Thus,

for every transitive SS verb of the language which functions in a clause

which may contain an overt (subject) expression of an agentive argument,

there is an ES passive or intransitivized counterpa rt, which functions in

a c l aus e where there is usua l l y no overt expression of an a gentive argument

- though one is usually implied.         Similar ly, for every intransitive SS v erb

there i s an ES transi tivized form which has an additiona l agentive argument.
                                          466


Such transitivized forms function in clauses in which the agentive may be

expressed as clause subject.      For transitive SS verbs there is also usually

a causative ES form which functions in clauses in which the clause subject

will express a second or "higher" or "instigating" agentive argument.            In

such a case syntactic expression of the "lower" or "mediating" agentive

argument is commonly omitted.

        There are some very productive processes associated with the form-

ation of ES verbs.   There are also a few irregular forms.        Generally speaking,

the existence of an irregular form "filling the gap" lexically appears to

"block" the application of the more regular and productive rule (Aronoff 1976).

        The productive word formation rule for passives involves the

suffixation of -er    to the root, e.g.

             simple-stem transitive             extended-stem passive

             diib-        steal                 diiber-            be stolen
             wod-         put doUJn             woder-            be put doUJn
             f oc-       open                   f ocer-           be opened
             ?us-        aook                   ?u~er-            be cooked
             wg(g)l-     · touah, feel          w9(g)ler-         be touched/felt
             d~(~)s-     kill, grind            d~(~)ser-         be killed/ground
             wod'-       trap                   wod'er-           be trapped
        In passives of verbs having a root-final q        the vowel of the extension

is bakced and lowered to [a] ,     e.g.

             sonq-       kiss                   sonq [a] r-       be kissed
             ?alq-       speak                  ?alq[a]r-         be spoken

             r2(2)q-     hang                   rg( g )q [a] r-   be hung
        A handful of verbs have been found to have a passive extension -ser,

either instead of, or in free variation with, the more regula r       -er suffix,

e.g.

             kam-        pick up                kamser-           be picked up
                                              467



              ga'l-            bite                    ga?er- -              be bitten

                                                       ga?ser-

              tig-             have sexual inter- tig[z]er-                  have sexual inter-
                               course (man)                                  course (woman)

              wur-             hear, Us ten to         wurser-               be heard/listened to

        A passive ES verb is employed in the case of a number of                   important

verbs having a subjective or reflexive meaning in such cases a cognate SS

verb may not even exist, e.g.

              qob-er-         get dressed;      ?es-er-       hear   (cf.   ?es-   know);
              daaq- [a] r-       become hungry; seeq- [a] r-            suffer pain/sick-
              ness; q§!.z-er-         feel cold;     saam-er-        become thirsty;

              lall-er- ffow           (cf.   lall-   pour);     gal t-er-       become old, age
              (cf. gal   ta     old person, old)

        The regular rule for forming causatives involves suffixation of -sis

to the root, e.g.

              simple-stem verb                        extended-stern verb

        (a)   transitive                              causative

              aaf-             find                    ;:i,~fsis-           cause to find

              gi?-             hit                     gi?sis-              cause to hit

              duuk-           bury                    duuksis-              cause to bury

              kam-            pick up                 kamsis-               cause to pick up

              wur-            hear                    wursis-               cause to hear

              lall-           pour out                 lalsis-              cause to pour out
        (b)   intrans itive                           transitivized

              wo'l-           stand up ( intr.)       wo?sis-               stand up (tr.)

              leeq-           chat                    leeqsis-              engage in
                                                                            conversation

               ..
              yir-            be startled             y;i_rsis-             startle

              daqal-          become bad              daqalsis-             make bad

              siir-           become pregnant         siirsis-              make pregnant
                                           468



        The initial       s of -sis undergoes a voicing assimilation, when
the root-final consonant is a voiced obstruent, e.g.

               diib-        steal                   diib[z]is-                    cause to steal

               s'eed-       become short            s'eed[z]is-                   shorten ( tr.)

               sug-         push                    sug[z]is-                     cause to push

               ~z-          run                     f!,[z : ]is-                  cause to run

Root-final sonorants do not generally bring about such voicing assimilations,

though an exception occurs in the case of bir-                  pass, precede, which in
the perfect 1 paradigm (see§ 2. 7.2.2.)          has a variant containing [z], i.e.,

3s bir[s]e - bir[z]e               he/she passed.     More typical examples, however,

are the following:

                ?imsis-     cause to give; mersis-                       cause to forbid;
                woonsis-     cause to work; lalsis-                        cause to pour out
        Root-final d'       may simply reduce to          [?] before the causative
suffix, e.g.

               ?ad'-        give birth              ?a[?]sis- ·                   cause to give
                                                                                 birth

               sud'-        coUect, store           su[?]sis-                    cause to collect

               ?oyd'-       become hot              ?oy[?]sis-                   heat
Alternatively, d'       may undergo coalescence with the initial                     s   of the

causative suffix to yield [ t-· h
                                s ] ,      which is parallel to the behaviour of
                                                      .          -h
stem-final     t, which coalesces with     s to give [ t · s ] ,                 e.g.

               ?ad'-        give birth              ?a[h' ]is-                   cause to give
                                                                                 birth

         There is an interesting consonant harmony process in Aari, whereby

the presence of a palate-alveolar sibilant ( s, z, c, c'                                  , .) )   anywhere . in

t h e root w1·11 b ring

This process will operate across intervening non-sibilant segments.                                               The

causative suffix        -sis is an obvious candidate for the process, e.g.

               ?us-               cook                        ?u [ f : ] i r J ] -                   cause to cook

If, in addition to the presence of a palate-alveolar sibilantin the root,

the root-final consonant is a voiced obstruent, the initial sibilant of the

suffix is   subjec~     to the obstruent voicing rule described above, viz.

              q~z-                become co ld                q~[ ~:           ]i( f]-              make co l d

In the case of root-final palate-alveola r a ffricates the initial segment

of the causative suffix undergoes total assimilation (or coalescence ?),

Although the last example is the only instance of a root-final                                           J   I   there
                                                                                                     ,..._
is another example of a causative stem which terminates in                                          [d·r;] • for

if palatalization of the first sibilant in the causative suffix occurs, and this

is      preceded by a root-final            d, voicing assimilation and coalescence occur.

The resulting segment is phonetically indistinguishable from the last example,

e.g.
                                                                -...

           A few intransitive verbs have been found to have causative ES

counterparts with a formative              -~,   rather than -sis,                           e.g.
                                                                v

                  b(u)ruk-        boil. (intr.)         b(u)ruks-                                   boil (tr.J

                  c 'ub-          emit smoke            c'ubs-                                      cause to smoke

In the perfect 1 forms of          c':ub- and c'ub-s-,                            in which a -se(qe)

formative follows the stem, only the obstruent voicing rule distinguishes
                  24
the two verbs          , viz.

                  c'ub[z; Je(qe)                                            it emitted smoke

                  c'ub[f]e(qe) - c'ub(I· ]e(qe) he cause s t hg to smoke

A handful of intransitive verbs were collected in which there is a consonant

+    s sequence   stem-finally, even though there appear to be no (extant) simple-

stem verbs from which such verbs could be said to be derived.                                          It is most
                                                       25
convenient to regard these as "deponent"                    causatives, e.g.

                  p 1 oqs-      t hi nk, desire;       ?,.WS-          r est, become free;

                  become s t artl ed

          A few verbs have been recorded with a monoconsonantal causative
                                         471


extension   -s, viz.
               'lay-        break ( intr.)         'lays-          break (tr.)

               lanq-        feel tired             lanqs-          til"e, make tiPed

               d'aw-        show                   d'aws-          cause to show

Two others (both having a root-final sequence consisting of a sonorant

consonant + glottal stop) have a causative extension         -is, viz.
               qol?-        add to, pour in        qol?is-         cause to add to

               gin?-        fall asleep            gin?is-         cause to s Leep

          Finally attention is directed to a comparison between the intransitive

verb    maat- return, go back, happen, become and its transitive counter-
parts    maasis- and maas- , both of which mean return (tr.).            It looks

here as if the intransitive stem itself contains a -t          extension formative.

This is of some interest, since passive/intransitivizing extension suffixes

in -t     occur in the Ometo languages (see, for example, Adams 1983: 129ff,

Hayward 1982: 244ff).


§2.7.2. VERB INFLECTION:


§2.7.2.1. INFLECTIONAL CATEGORIES AND PROCESSES:

          The inflected forms that are considered here are aspect and tense

paradigms, imperative and jussive paradigms, and the negative forms

appropriate to these.     It will be noted that all verb inflections in Aari

involve suffixation,

          Considerably more research will be necessary before the precise

significance and function of the various aspect and tense forms described

here are appreciated.     It appears, however, that there is primarily a perfect

: imperfect dichotomy.     The formatives of the imperfect are       - d a 26 1n
                                                                              .     t
                                                                                        he

affirmative and   -ay in the negative.         Reduplication of the root, or part

of the root, is also a common, though not invariable feature of the          imperfec~


aspect (see below).     There are two paradigms for the perfect, which contain
                                             472




-se( qe)       and -ta    formatives respectively in the affirmative.                 They share

a common set of negative forms, which contain a formative                      -ki,   Unfortunately

the nature of the distinction conveyed by selection of one or other of the

two forms is not understood.

       Past tense forms are formed for the perfect and imperfect by means

of a postposed auxiliary verb         ~~q-   ,     This verb also occurs as a perfect

(past ?) copula.        In addition, there is a main verb              ~~q-,   which means

pass the day, and without doubt the copulative                  ~~q-   with its auxiliary

verb development has evolved from this.             Nevertheless, the inflectional

behaviour of the two is now very distinct.                  As a main verb meaning pass the

day   a.a.q-    displays the full range of paradigmatic variation possible for

a verb.    The perfect copula      ~~q-,     however, is a single paradigm verb (see

§2.7.2.5.), and as an auxiliary, it commonly appears with just one invariable

form (as inspection of the paradigms of the perfect past and imperfect past

will show).         (In the paradigms the auxiliary          ~~q-   is linked to the preceding

main verb by means of a hyphen.         This device is intended to indicate that
                                                   27
the auxiliary probably has clitic status                •   The simple imperfect may be

used to indicate an incompleted action either in the present or in the

future.    In addition, however, there is a special future tense, though it

appears not to have its own negative.            The formative of the future seems

to be a        -t   with singular persons, and -st with plural persons-; but there

is also a curious        -er element, which appears in most forms of the future

paradigm instead of the usual pronominal elements.

       The affirmative imperfect very commonly exhibits reduplication in

the case of monosyllabic stems.        There are actually two patterns of

reduplication.        In one type the entire root is reduplicated, and in the

other reduplication affects only the first CV sequence.                   It is noted that

double vowels are usually reduced to single ones in both patterns. Both forms
                                              473


seem to be equally acceptable: the reduced reduplication pattern is probably

typical of a more casual or rapid style of speech, e.g.

                    basic stem      imEerfect - 3s form

                    c'up'-         <!'up'c'up'cta        - c'uc'up'da      squeeze

        but         daqal-         daqalda                                 beaome bad
           The affirmative imperative has a -ka              formative.   The negative has

a preposed element ~~y               The jussive . employs an invariable verb form

with a formative           -en .   The various subject agreements (non-2nd person,

of course,) are distinguished only by means of preverbal pronouns.                   It is

an optional feature of the jussive that it is preceded by the bare stem of

the verb, thus exhibiting the "complex" type of paradigm common in Koyra

(cf .   Hayward 1982: 249).        Like the imperative the jussive negative has a

preposed      ~~y   .   In 3rd persons the -en           formative is maintained in the

negative, but in the non-3rd persons (= lst person forms) there is both stem

reduplication and a -ka            suffix.

           Except in the case of 3rd person singular forms, pronominal subject

agreement markers are suffixed to the aspect or negative formatives.                   In

the case of past tense forms the subject marker may be suffixed either to

the main verb or to the auxiliary            ~~q-   .      In the case of 3s verb forms

it is not possible to recognise a common suffixal element.                Thus, for the

verb    qaal- aross we find the fo llowing forms for 3s persons - which should
be compared with the accompanying 2s forms.

         affirmative future                      qaalter                      qaaltay

On account of the complete lack of uniformity in 3s subject agreement markers,

the various terminal vowels in 3s forms are analysed as belonging to the

formatives for aspect, tense, negative, etc.                  It will be noted, however,

that the various terminal vowels of these formatives are absent in non-3s

persons of the paradigm, i.e., when subject agreement markers occur.                            It

is further noted that the non-3s subject agreement markers are all vowel-

initial, viz.

                ls            -it                lp                            -9(9)t
                2s            -ay                2p                            -et
                                                 3p                            -ek
The analysis proposed here is that when (as a result of morphological processes)

vowels are juxtaposed within a word, the first one unde·rgoes elision.                          Thus:

         2s affirmative perfect 1        qaalse           +    ay       ~   qaals[a]y
         lp affirmative imperfect        qaqaalda              +    9.(9)t      +    qaqaaldq(Q)t
         ls negative perfect        qaalki   +   it       +   qaalk[1]t
         3p·affirmative perfect 2       qaalta        +       ek    +       qaalt[e]k
   Cp.   2p negative imperfect       qaal + ay + et                 +       qaalay[e]t

Such an analysis claims that 3s forms are unmarked.                          (The alternative

interpretation would, of course, require us to say that for each paradigm

there was a different allomorph for the 3s subject agreement marker.)                            It

is worth pointing out that although it is true that Aari does not permit

sequences of dissimilar vowels (see §1.4.), it would not carry any conviction



                                                                                                        ....-
                                                                                                        .
                                                475



to say that the vowel elision process was motivated by this, for this would

leave the single vowels in the ls negative perfect shown above, and in forms

such as the following

        2p affirmative perfect 1              qaalse + et          -+   qaals [ e] t
        2s affirmative i mperfect             qaqaalda       +     ay   -+   qaqaald [a] y
without explanation, for the double vowels crea ted here by the affixation

would not violate the prohibition on dissimilar vowel sequences.                         The elison

process has to be regarded as a mo rphological rule.

Notes to the paradigms:

1)       The righthand variants are obviously contracted forms.        It will be

         noted that in the perfect past 1 the formative       -seqe generally
         appears in full (apart from final vowel elision); only for the 3s

         person is there a contracted variant.

2)       These negatives do duty for both the affirmative paradigms.

3)       Variants in which the subject agreement markers are suffixed to the

         auxiliary (as in the imperfect pas t) were not recorded, though they

         may well exist.

4)       There is no future negative; the negative imperfect is employed.

5)       There is complete homophony here with the 2s affirmative perfect 2.

6)       Attention is directed to the non-distinctness of 3s : ls and 2p : 3p

         members in this paradigm.


§ 2.7.2.3. INTERROGATIVE FORMS:

         In polar interrogative sentences ("Yes/No" questions) verb forms are

regularly marked w.ith a t erminal -o forma tive.   In 3s forms, where this -o
                                         479


follows the vowel of the aspect or negative formatives, the latter undergo

elision (see above).      The interrogative paradigms are exemplified with 3s

and 3p forms; all remaining forms pattern like the 3p form and are fully

predictable.

§.2. 7. 2. 4. ALTERNATION IN THE INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY:

       Certain morphological and phonological processes operate at the

boundaries of stems and consonant-initial inflectional suffixes.

       With the       -se(qe)     formative of perfect 1 .processes identical to

those described in the case of the initial s of the causative suffix are

seen to operate (see §2.7.1.2.), e.g.
       • "   -   •   '"      "r     '   •   1f-'           ~ ''          ~       :       '        •    ~   :..   -,_,.,   '   '"'   J   >   .~   I   ,.

It should be noted that the final four examples have extended (causative)

stems, which have themselves been subject to palatalisation.                              Palatalisation

also operates across a stem containing the passive suffix                          -er ,     e.g.

             !:ien-er-                 ~~ner [         f] e( qe)               it was bought/sold

             ?aac-er-                  ?~acer[             J]e(qe)            it tJas hidden

The obstruent voicing process is seen to interact with palatalisation in

the following:-

             c'ub-                    ~'ub(~]e(qe)                             he made sthg smoke

As in the case of the causative· suffix root-final palato-alveolars trigger

total assimilation (or         coalesc~nce),                 e.g.

             tee-                     te[t·J  e(qe)                            he out

In sed-    with a root-final                      d ,       the palatalised element of the perfect

1 formative undergoes voicing and coalescence, e.g.

             sed-                     se [d.~ ] e ( q e)                       he saw/looked at

       Suffixation of the -da                        formative of the imperfect to root-final

d'   results in a perseverative assimilation (or coalescence), e.g.

                                                                              collects
        Suffixation of the perfect 2                          -ta formative to root-final      d, and
suffixation of the imperfect                      -da formative to root-final t           both result

in anticipatory assimilations, e.g.
                                                                                                 ?7i 'X'll

§2.7.2.5. IRREGULAR VERBS:

        The three common and important verbs a?.-d-                 come,    kay- go, and
tey- take are somewhat irregular in not having an affirmative perfect                        1

containing the sibilant element of the            -se (qe ) formative.             In these verbs

the contracted form of the perfect I paradigm is formed by direct attachment

of the s ubject agreement markers to the root. though in the cases of kay-

and   t ey- the stem-final segment geminates, viz.

             fl.~d-                    kay-                                 tey-

All other paradigms of these three verbs appear to be perfectly regular.

      The root     doq- is common to two quite distinct verbs, though the

semantic relationship between the two is quite transparent•               doq-   meaning

be present, exist (i.e., a locative-existential verb) has only two paradigms.

There is an affirmative paradigm which resembles those of the three

irregular verbs just considered, at least in its formal characteristics

(though not with regard to its accentual pattern or the vowel of the

formative in the 3s form).      But though there is a formal similarity, this

paradigm of doq-     differs from those other three verbs in that it has an

imperfect or present tense sense.          The other paradigm of this verb is a

negative which is again perfect in form while being imperfect in sense, viz.

                            affirmative                          negative

            ls              doqi'.t(e)                           dakk~t

            2s              doqay                                dakkay

            3s              d oqa
                                ,.28                             dakki

            lp              doqQ(Q)t(e)                          dakk§(g)t
            2p              doqet(e)            ,. ( e ) 28

            3p              doqek(e)            ,. ( e ) 28

This same negative paradigm serves as the negative for the copula (see §2.6.).

It would seem reasonable to doubt that the negative is actually based on the

same root as the affirmative.          Not only is the root vowel different, but, as

shown above (see §2 .7.2.4.) juxtaposition of the             k e lement of the perfect
       ..,      .   "        '      Ji.,,..        •• "'   '      .,    . "    "   •                 '                       ,c     ;i;\   ...   •

negative to a root-final q                                 usually results in perseverative assimilation

of the         k        , rather than anticipatory assimilation of the                                        q .       It seems

likely that we have to regard the root in the negative paradigm as dak-,
                                                                                                29

              Reference has already been made to the root                                                       As a        full

a compound paradigm based on dak-, viz.

§2. 7.3. RELATIVE CLAUSE FORMS:

             There appear to be several ways of forming relatives, and it is

not at all clear whether this variation is syntactically governed or free .

The most frequently encountered type in my mate rial involves suffixation

of      -inda(a)                 to the tense/aspect/polarity formative.                                   Such relative
                                        485



forms do not inflect for subject agreement, though it seems likely that

they are based on 3s forms.     What I believe to be the underlying forms

of the relative verb forms of    sed- see are as follows:

                          affirmative                           negative

            perfect 1    sed-seqe-inda(a)
                                                             sed-ki-inda(a)
            perfect 2    sed-te-inda(a)           -n(aa)
            imperfect    sed-da-inda(a)                      sed-ay-inda(a)
In terms of the affirmative perfect 2         -inda{a) has what seems to be
a genuine free variant with -n ( aa) .        My informant would not accept any

forms with root reduplication (see §2.7.2.1.).

       In the following examples it will be noted that in NPs with object

function the relative terminates in -it am -        -i tern .      While it is obvious

that this is a complex containing the accusative marker, it is not so obvious

what the -it     represents, since such an element has only been noted in
                                                                     29
NPs in which the head is singulative feminine (see §2.1.1.)               •   Another

thing to be noted is that at the junction of the tense/aspect/polarity

formative with the relative formative         -inda(a)     either the vowel of

the former or the latter is elided.       The accent in relative forms is always

on this juncture syllable.    It should also be noted that like other modif-

ying constituents in NPs, relative clauses usually follow the head, though

a prehead order does also occur. e.g.

            ~~ ziig[z]eq1nda(a) ziigan za?[J]e

            The thing you wanted arrived
            ?i ?esertenaa guddayin laqaml-ye
            The business that I heard about is good

            ?~edsin 1[~:]ert~n       ?f-b11be
            The man who got sick is my father

            gunin kg(g)m ga?seqanditam            d~(g)site

            I   killed the snake that bit her
                                       486



            ?anzitan leeqdinditam wQ(Q)ta ?es?esdQ(Q)te
            We know the girl who is dancing
             ,     ,        ,   , [ ........... h]
            ki naskinda(a) rey maa t·s e
            A thing he did not like happened

            WQ(Q) bookkinda(a) ?oolen daqalse
            The pit which we did not dig got spoiled

            ?i   n*~dinda(a)    ?isin za?[f]e
            The food that I like has arrived
            ki gaaddinda(a) reyn ?in dass gaadda
            The thing he is saying pleases me

            ~a ~edayindatem      rey   ~~n   dawsdit
            I will show you what you do not see
       Headless relatives are also common, e.g.

            ba~ten   n§(g)-ye
            He is the one who overcame

            wo~qinda(a)     feed'ay
            The dry one is useless

            fi[t:]ertenaa wg(g)te
            We are the created (ones)

            ~endinda(a)     ?i-b~~be

            The one who is buying/selling is my father

            birdinda(a) wg(g)m googinem d'ad'awda
            The one who is going ahead will show us the way
       In addition to the relative clause forms described above other forms

with a formative   -aab have been noted, and similar forms are also recorded
by Bender and Tully, e.g.

            ?aksin ?uugumd'aabsin ?eedam ga?ga?da

            The dog that is barking bites people

                            The man who did not die ran away

     §2.7.4. SUBORDINATE CLAUSE FORMS:

                 Only a few types of subordinate (adverbial) clauses were investigated.

                 Affirmative and negative conditionals are based on (what appears to

    be) the perfect 1 and perfect negative stems, viz.

                                                 affirmative                                                            negative

                                                 If I {eta. )_ work •.•                                                 If I {eta.) do not work
                     ls                         ?i w6onsink(a)                                                           ?i woonkink(a)
                      2s                        ~~ w6onsink(a)                                                           ~fr woonkink(a)
                     3s.m                       ki I        n~(g)              w6onsink(a)                               ki     I   llQ(Q)

                     etc.                                                                                                woonkink(a) etc.
    eg.

                             ?1      dfib[z]ink(a) qat't'a?erdit
                            If I steal, I shall be punished
                 There is a temporal clause based on the imperfect stem in the

    affirmative.                 The appropriate negative, however, looks more as if it is

    based on the perfect negative.                                        As in the conditional, the actual verb

    form itself is invariable, viz.

                                                 affirmative                                                            negative

                                                 When I (etc.) speak ••.                                                When I (etc.) do not
                                                                                                                        speak ...

                     ls                         ?1 ?alqd1k                                                               ?1     ?alqek.ls

                     2s                         ~~ ?alqdik                                                               ~~ ?alqek1s

                     etc.                                                                                               etc.

                 Certain clauses of time, cause and extent have the structure of NPs

    with relative clause complements (see §2.7.3.).                                                            In the case of the time
                                          488


clause there is an overt head which has the independent meaning time, day.

The other two cases have probably to be analysed as headless NP complements

of postpositions, e.g.

                 ?i ?alqseqinda ses'e                when I spoke

                 ?i ?i[t~h]eqinda kan                bec:ause I eat af. kan   for
                 ?i   fo~kinda   kan                 beaause I didn't open
                 ?1 ?esq1nda diras                   until I knew

 §2.7.5. THE CONVERB:

           Bender and Tully have recorded the following paradigm for the verb

?i   ~-   eat, which I take the liberty of presenting here in the transcription
employed throughout this paper.

                ls    ?isito                    lp   ?isg(g)to

                 2s   ?isayo                    2p   ?iseta

                3s    ?isiyo   I ?isiso         3p   ?iseka

e.g.

                 n~(Q)   ?isito katama kayye

                 Having eaten he went to town


 §2.7.6. THE INFINITIVE:

           Reference has already been made to a deverbative form having the

suffix -mi,(see §2.4.), and in the field-notes compiled by Bender and

Tully there are some sentences which suggest that this form could be

 interpreted as having an infinitive-like function, e.g.

                 wo~'mi laqamte

                 Drinking/to drink is good
                 azmi kan laqamte

                 (It) is good for running
 They also record forms such as the following in which what appears to be

 the postposition kan follows the verb stem, e.g .
f~£S!<C,! '. '.    '..::::=::; ;;_;;;;:=c:,:, Rrit·wewrizoeiiiMWt!BWWttrtif'IRtWfWt''"t;;t&k#ffi
                                             489


               ?ita woc'-kan zlziigdit
               I    want to drink
          My own researches show the formation of a regular infinitive/verbal

  noun involving the suffixation of -inti           to the stem, e.g.

               WQC I in t i tO drink; gap I in t i     tO   grow;   aaf in t i    to find;

               k~(~)zinti to tel:l;         d6(e)sinti to kiU/grind.
  The form occurs in both subject and object functions, e.g.

               woc'inti nasayt
               I do not like to drink

               diibinti daqal1-ye
               To steal/stealing is. bad


  §2.8.   LOCATIVE NOUNS AND POSTPOSITIONS:

          There are a number of items denoting spatial locations, such as:

               zan        top, superior location;    bur external Location;

               goyr        inferior Location; seeger        side location;       gid1r -
               gid~r,        gir international location
  These occur as heads of genitive constructions (though a genitive suffix is

  not invariably present: see §2.1.2.), thereby furnishing a series of

  locative expressions.          It is not at all obvious how or, indeed, whether

  such items should be distinguished from other postposed elements such as:

               kan        for;    da, dar, re to;    z~n~nka,       girank, -rank
                   (or   rank?} from;     kikil with
  Some examples are:

               gunfsin dooniyent gidir (doqa)
              The snake is inside the sack

               ?unt1sin guftant goyr (doqa)
              The mouse is under the skin

               diira zan doqse                       eherank aade
              He sat on the grass                    He came from the house
                                          490


          ~resin        aaqent   s~eger   (doqa)

         The donkey is besi de the tree

          tiilen ehent bur (doqa)
         The water-pot is outside the house
          mik~f        kan ?isfn ?fmsit             gaban dar kiyye

         I gave food to the beggar                  He went to market
          ?1 girank kayyeke                         ki re     a~dit

         They went away from me                     I   came t o him




NOTES:

*        I acknowledge here my gratitude to the Central Research Fund of

         the University of London for a financial grant which covered the

         costs of the research presented in this paper.

1.       This figure appears in Jensen,1959.            The figure given in Bender

         et a'l. (1976) is 32, OOO.
2.       Bender and Tully have recorded a few cases of              j in free variation

         with     z.    e.g. J'oga - zoga cyclone,         hurricane; Ja?- - za?-
         arrive, reach.        They also recorded   j in     a~im    sick, where I have

         z. i.e.       ~z1m.

3.       In all words where I have recorded         q Bender and Tully have either

         k', k     or x.

4.       Although Bender and Tully make no reference to the breathy phonation

         feature, certain items in their material have variant transcriptions

         indicative of the phenomenon described here, e.g •

                . aase - haaste he wiped;       as in a - hasina how? ( cf. my            ~sn.l)

                 noha      noa f i r e (cf. my no ha     - n9 (~));    yin~i   - ins' i

                child    (cf. my   Y!nsi)
5.       Compare the effect of breathy phonation on tone in certain Bantu

         languages of the Nguni group; see Ladefoged,1971: 13ff; Rycroft,

         1983.
                                          491


6.    I have recorded only one item which would require a modification

      of this statement, i.e., ?ist-            a     contracted form of ?iste my.

7.    Bender and Tully also recorded a vocative in -o               e.g.

            ?in do mother!;       anzi teno     girl.'
8.    In this respect Aari resembles Amharic in having a marked accusative

      in definite NPs, and its case system is typologically different

      from that of most of the North Omotic (not to mention East Cushitic)

      languages, which have a marked nominative : unmarked non-nominative

      case system.      Significantly, however, Hamer also appears to be a

      language      of the Aari type (see Lydall 1976: 432).

9.    Here again there are variants with e instead of              a.

10.   Bender and Tully also noted the correlation between definiteness

      and plurality.

11.   It will be noted that in some cases the TV is replaced by i               when

      -ta       is added, e.g.    ?anza : ?abzutan;          but this does not always

      occur.

12.   This is not the case in many Ethiopian languages.

13.   Although most of my examples show             -t(a)   attaching directly to

      the determiner stem, a few examples indicate that             -n(a)    may also

      be present, e.g.

            nood'isin koonat(e) zana ziigdit
            I   1,)G,nt this leopard's skin

14.   Bender and Tully have       ?al) for male and ma or man for f emale.
      These occur in pairs of compounds such as ?al) -zob Zion                : ma-zob

      lioness;     '.laIJ-baaca   cock:    man-baaca        hen.
15.   Sometimes I heard this as       k~(?.),       i.e., with a breathy vowel, a s

      in the object and possessive pronoun forms k§ ( ~ )m and              k~( 9 )tt~n.

      I have no explanation for this variation.
                                          492


16.    For a speculative discussion of the possible significance of this

       suffix see Hayward, in preparation.

17.    It seems most likely that the yj,-          (as opposed to   ki- or ko-)

       base in yimatam reflects a (uniquely preserved) "referential"

       or "impersonal" distinction still found throughout the entire set

       of third person pronouns in Hamer (see Lydall 1976: 414 ff).

18.    I have represented the pronouns with hyphens here, since their lack

       of accent suggests they may be enclitic (cf. similar forms described

       for Zayse in Ch.Four.

19 .   The root or stem       de- (or    dee- ) appears in a few sentences in

       the corpus.     It is almost certainly a reflex of Proto-Omotic       *d~;


       see Hayward 1984 l-.

20.    Bender and Tully also note a suffixal (or enclitic) determiner             -ka,
       e.g.

              ?eesin-ka    thi s man
21.    These words would appear to share a common root.

22.    I say "may contain an overt subject" for the simple reason that

       given the appropriate discourse situation, any non-verb constituent

       may be dropped - as is the case in many Ethiopian languages.

23.    Strictly spea king the process is one of "palato-alveolarization".

       The occurrence of this feature in Aari is of considerable interest

       in view of the fact that it is also found in at least two of the

       Ometo languages, i.e., Koorete (see Hayward 1982 : 245 ff) and

       Zayse (see Ch.Four), as well as in Gimira (see Ch . 1.,§2.7.1.         Sub-

       class B).     In view of the non-contiguity of these languages geograph-

       ically , it is unconvincing to explain the process as an "areal

       feature".

24.    Suffixation of     -se (qe)      to the   Cs~   stem-final sequence will

       result in palatalization, and the resultant segment ma y be

            durationally longer, i.e.,                   [ f:] rather than   [ I] , but post-

            consonantally the distinction is difficult to hear, and may not

            be a regular feature.                  However, in other forms of the paradigm there

            is a clear distinction since as it is part of the stem, the -S is,

            of course, found throughout the entire paradigms of such causatives,

            e.g.

                     bruk~ka              boit. it.';   bruksay he UJiU not bait it; etc.

   25.      I use this term for any ES verb which has no obvious SS cogener.

   26.      For a discussion of this formative, see Hayward 1984 b .

   27.      3s forms of the imperfect past suggest a clitic interpretation,

            for in these forms the preceding vowel drops.

   28.      The low vowel in these forms should be compared with the low vowel

            alternant of the passive extension, which also occurs following                     q

            (see §2.7.1.2.).

   29.      In the East Cushitic language Qafar headless relative clauses

            regularly take feminine gender.
