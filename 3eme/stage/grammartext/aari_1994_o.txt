    Word Formation In Ari
    Daniel Aberra
    Kotebe College O f Teacher Education


        Abstract:   This paper deals with the w ord formation system s o f Ari. The
        objective is to provide a thorough account o f A ri nominalization, verbaliza­
        tion and adjectivization and their morphophonemic processes. Two major
        findings are (i) the establishment of the presence o f personal and imper­
        sonal passives and single-double causatives, (ii) high-lighting the presence
        of bidirectional palatalizations (an autosegment {highly usually parameter­
        ized as only o f right or left direction in a language).




    INTRODUCTION
       Ari is one o f the three South Omotic languages spoken in the previous
   Bako-Gazer now South Omo region (i.e. Jinka and the surrounding areas). It
   has over a hundred thousand speakers and ten dialects. Concerning the dialects
   and the surrounding languages Daniel (1993:1) writes that "alter making a
 ; dialect comparison, Ford (1985) remarks that excluding the three dialects
 • Baigedda, Gayli and Seyki, because they are spoken at the northern border
   area o f the region, all the others have 85% shared vocabulary." Ford found that
   *Biyo, Shangama, Sida and Ubaamer are central dialects"., and she expressed
  her preference to term the group "Sida". According to Ford, "Ari is also sur­
   rounded by six diiferent languages: Basketo, Gofa, Oyda, Banna (Hamer), Kara
: and Dime. It is only in the south part that the lingua-franca composed o f Ari
   and Hamer i.e. Kara is found."
       The present work on Ari is structured as follows: In the first part o f the
   description and rewriting rule for the word formation o f nominals, verbals and
: adjectivals are described. The second part is about compounding, and the third
 ^discusses m ajor morphophonemic processes.

    NOMINALS

             In Ari nouns are marked for inflection number, gender, case and
 : article. They are also in the majority o f cases indentified by the final vowels
.• ?/i/o r/a/.

INTRODUCTION_________________________________
     One method o f the ondemtos, the Amharic commentaries, is to narrate the
story or biography o f a person mentioned in the main text, e. g., when Adam
occurs in the original text, his biography is told in the commentary. The sources
of these stories are, besides the Bible, the apocrypha, the hagiographical and
monastic legends and the patristic writings.
    The andemta on the Ethiopian anaphora o f Our Lady M ary ascribed to
Cyriacus o f Behensa, the Qeddase Maryam, contains many such biographical
stories. Most o f them are well-known and can be found in the other andemtas,
too.'
    This paper deals with one passage from the andemta on the Qeddase
Maryam, which describes the life o f Judas Iscariot before he became an apostle.
After the translation o f this passage, a comparison with the western legend o f
Judas Iscariot follows. Subsequently, a survey on the Ethiopian literature shall
provide evidence for this legend in other sources.

THE ANDEMTA ON THE ANAPHORA OF OUR LADY
MARY ASCRIBED TO CYRIACUS OF BEHENSA
     The Anaphora o f Our Lady M ary Ascribed to Cyriacus o f Behensa was
 edited and translated into German by S. Euringer in 1937.2
     The Institutio (paragraph 81) reads: “und zu ihnen (den Aposteln) wurde
jener gerechnet, dessen N atur unter den Weizen gem ischtes Unkraut war,
              kuri        'honey'    aqa           tree'

              waki        'cow'      anza          'girl'

    NOUN INFLECTIONS
        The two morphological case-marking suffixes are accusative /-m /, and
    genitive /-t(a)/.
              ki-t            epi-n-ta
              3s.m.-gen      ’his' cry-def-gen        'o f crying'

              3s.m-acc       'him' fire-acc           'fire'
         The morphemes1o f masculine and feminine gender affixed on nouns, speci­
    fiers, and adjectives are:
              m.     -si   -i        agg-
              p-     -t    -o        ma-

              et-t    'woman'         yints-9          'girl'
          The plural morpheme is /-a/. Nouns are unmarked for being singular.
              ed-in-a                 ma-yints-an-a
              adult-def-pl    ’the people’ f-child-def-pl 'the girls*

              yints-in-a
              child-def-pl    'the children’
       Nouns and adjectives can be either definite or indefinite. Indefiniteness is
    unmarked, and the definite marker is /-n (a)/.
              buna           tokmi
              coffee 'coffee'         small 'small*

              coffee-def     th e coffee    small-def           the small'
          The rewriting rule for Ari infections based on the model o f Selkirk (1982)
    is:
              N ~> N          (Af)              (Af)            (Af)         (Af)

    DERIVATION OF NOUNS
        Nouns are formed in different ways from the stem, (a) Gerundive nominals
    are formed by suffixing /-inti/:
         dib   'steal' dib-inti         'stealing'
         uz-  'beautiful'       uz-inti 'becoming beautiful'
         won- 'work'won-inti            'working'
         mat- 'become*          mat-inti         *becoming'
         leq-  'play' leq-inti          'singing'
   Stem +/-inti/ can also mean 'way o f Vstem'. The W FR for gerundive
nominals is:
        [[x-]v-inti] -> [X]N
    (b)      Some instrumental nouns are formed by suffixing /-i/y-a/, /-int/, by
com pounding w ith /-bot/ 'place' or syntactically by suffixing /ir-d-nda/
'pass.(imper)-imperf-that:

         zTtS'-     'close*   zit®’i            'door'
         dog-       'sit'     daqint            'chair'

   (c)       The process- or abstract nominal-forming suffixes are /-m i/ and /-ta/.

    (d)       The form o f agentive nominals is the same as that o f the relativized
form o f the verb. Syntactically, agentives can be derived from verbs o f action
and have a meaning like one who does the action stated by the verb (Comrie
and Thompson 1985: 351).

                                                                              4&V

         ay-        break'      a?ays-d-ab     breaker one who breaks'
     Like the process nominals, some agentives are also formed by suffixing /
-ta/ and /-m i/:
         gal-     'old'   gal-ta 'knowledgeable person*
         toe-     'cut*   toe-mi ’a person who cuts'
     In the majority o f cases agentivity is expressed at the level o f syntax. The j
word formation rules for process and agentive nominals are:
          [[x-]v -mi]—> [X]N                                                        j
          [[x-]A-ta] ~ > [X]N
     (e) Result nominals are formed from the base by suffixing either /-a/, /-i/
, the definite article /-an/ or, like process and agentive nonimals, by suffixing
/-mi/.

         alq-       'tell'      alq-an    'the speech'
    Nouns can be derived from other norms, adjectives and verbs by the addi­
tion o f some o f the suffixes o f (a)-(e), or without any addition or change of
form.

VERBALS
    Art verbs can be distinguished from nouns or adjectives by their endings.
Verbs in the majority o f cases end with consonants, and are also different in
their inflection.
VERB INFLECTIONS
    Verbs can be inflected for person, number, gender, tense, aspect or mood.
       Number, gender, and person
    Verbs do not have distinct number markers. Person and gender are indi­
cated by their pronoun prefixes in subordinate clauses and by suffixes in main
clauses (cf Daniel 1993).
                  singular               plural
        pers.     subordinate   main     subordinate   main
        1         ii-           -it      wo-           -ot
        2         ana-/aa-      -.ay     ye-           ■fit
        3m        ki-/yi- l     -e/-a2   ke-           ek-
        3f        ko-           -e/-a    ke-           -ek
     Tense: ArLdistinguishes present and past. Present tense is marked by /-a/,
          its-d-a-a
         eat-impf-3-pres            'he eats/will/eat'
     Past tense is marked by by /-e/. To indicate remote past the copulative
/aq(q)/ 'exist* is used after the main verb,
         waee-t-e-e
         descend-pf-3s-past 'he decended*
         $i?i-t-aq-y
         W ash-pf-exist-2pl 'you (pi) had washed’
         aq-e
         exist-3s                 'he lived1
    It appears from the data and also from the available literature that tense
markers are on the verge o f diappearing. Sometimes the verbs are marked and
in other times they are unmarked. In some situations they mean the opposite o f
what they do elsewhere,
         ard-aq-s
         enter-exist-pf           'He entered'
         day-e
         exist-3s                 'He lived"
    Regarding this, Alemayehu3 (1981: 56-58) states that:
           there are what may be interpreted as strong traces o f past -e/
           i, present - a ... in both Southern and Northern Omotic... Ari
           has -a, -e, and -o in the past, present and converb marking
           suffixes respectively. In many cases, they have reversed the
           function, some o f them have been lost. In other cases conso­
           nants rather than vowels occur as tense-marking elements.
    To summarize: tense is overlooked on aspect markers.
ASPECT
    Aspect like tense has two divisions: the perfective, marked by /-s/ or /-t/,
and the imperfective, marked by Ad/.

         ep-s-e-e
         ciy-pf-3s-past          "he cried'
         rat-t-a-a
         sleep-pf-35-pres        'he sleeps'
         dox-d-a
         live-impf-pres          'it exists'
    /-1/ and /-s/ occur freely without allomorphic conditions. Concerning the
perfective aspect, See also Bender (1989:10).
    The word formation rule for Ari verb inflections is:
          V ~> V         Af             Af           Af
                         [m aspect]     [m person]   [m tense]

DERIVATION OF VERBS
    There are causative and passive derived verbs.
        Causative
    The causative is marked as part o f the verb by geminating the last conso­
nant o f the stem and suffixing /-si/ when there is a direct relation between the
cause, involved in the activity as agent, and the effect. If the cause is not the
agent or not directly involved in the activity, the morpheme /-sis/, the double
causative marker, is suffixed.
         its-        'eat'       itstsis       lie caused it to be eaten'
         bul-        'release'   bullis        *he caused it to be released'
         doy-        Tail'       doysis        lie caused the killing'
         won-        ’work*      wonsise       he caused it to work'

        Passive
     There are two passive forms in Ari., with /-er/ and /-im/. Bender (1989:11)
states that the suffix o f the Ari passive-intransitive is /-er/ and that "to form
reciprocal/reflexives, Ari uses -im with plural object pronouns. This -im may
be simply the accusative marker." Though this needs further investigation, we
can safely say that /-er/ is the impersonal and /-im / the personal passive marker,
         marat-or-d-e
         product-pass-impf-past 'it was produced'
         es-im-d-e
         know-pass-impf-3s           'he is known*
         days-im-s-ok
         kill-pass-pf-3pl             'they are being killed by each other'
         kez-or-d-e
         tell-pass-impf-3s           'it will be told'
            Causative and personal passive can occur together having the meaning of
       causative reflexive,
                doys-im-s
                die-pass-caus. 'he caused the killing o f each other'
           The rule for these derivational affixes is:
                V ~> V         Af              Af
                               [m caus]        [m passive]
           Verbs can also be derived from adjectives or nouns by using apersonal
       suffix and different forms o f the verb 'to be':
                  aqg-ay-e
                  masc-2s-be          'you are a man'
                  may-ay-e
                  fem-2s-be           'you are a woman'

                   laxami          good            laxamiyee             is fine

                   dopan           certain         dopanee               is certain
                   liki            right           likiyee               is right
                   debi            thief           debiyee               is the thief
                   bilf            clever          bilt'iyee             is clever
                   asgorami        miracle         asgoramiyee           is a miracle

              The word formation rules for deriving verbs from adjectives and nouns
       are:
                  [[X ]A -X A f]V ~>[X ]V
                  [[X]N (-X Af )        X                 ]V --> [X ]V
                  [m pers]       [m cop]

[; ADJECTIVALS
            Most inherent adjectives in Ari end with /-m i/ and they may have the same
|f;    article, case and number markers as the noun which governs them. Some ad­
       jectives are also identical in form with the noun or the verb o f the same class.

      Concerning the base forms for work formations, Bender (ibid) writes that
’...identical noun and verb occur (i.e. one may consider those as roots used for
both functions), suppletive forms occur, or compounds may be simple juxta­
positions or a kind o f "construct" form'.

MORPHOPHONEMIC PROCESSES IN ARI
    The most frequent morphophonemic process taking placing is assimila­
tion. All four types o f assimilation are observed: progressive, regressive, adja­
cent, and distant.
VOICING ASSIMILATION
    The perfect aspect suffix /s/ becomes voiced due to the influnce o f a pre­
vious voiced obstruent, whereas the perfect or feminine suffix /t/ triggers
devoicing o f a preceding obstruent.

          gob-s ~> gobs         ’jumped’
          dob-s —> dobz         'threw'
          kez-s —> kezz         told'
          az-s —> azz           'run'
          Sad-t —> Satt         'saw'
          ed-t —> ett           'woman'
          Zag-t —> zakt         'sow'
          zig-t —> zikt         'wanted'

    The structural conditions for the spreading to take place in the above two
cases are in the first that the triggering segment has to have a feature [-sonorant]
and in the second that the changed segment has to have a feature [-continuant].
PALATAL ASSIMILATION
    There are two progressive palatalization processes, adjacent and distant
The adjacent assimilation o f -the perfect suffix fsl is total, while the distant
assimilation o f /s/ is partial.
       Adjacent total assimilation
          woS'-se     woe’e'e     'he drank'
          po£-se      poeee       'he opened'
          uS-se       uSS-e       'he cooked'
          guj-se      guj-iSe     'he added'
    The structural condition that has to be fulfilled is the presence o f ^ s tri­
dent] in both the trigger and the triggerred.
           Distant partial assimilation
               3i?i-s-e           §i?i§e           'he washed'
               eaa-s-e            £aa$e            'he slapped'
               Sad-s-e            sadze            'he saw'
               Xaq-s-e            2aq$e            'he threw’
               8an-s-e            SanSe            lie sold'
               zaq-sis-e          2aq3i3e          ’he made (someone) throw’

    As in adjacent palatalization, in distant assimilation also the change is from
[-high] to [+high]. In addition, the structural condition [+strident] has to be
present in both segments.
