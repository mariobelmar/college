Pacific Linguistics is a publisher specialising in linguistic descriptions, dictionaries, atlases and
other material on languages of the Pacific, the Philippines, Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
The authors and editors of Pacific Linguistics publications are drawn from a wide range of
institutions around the world.
Pacific Linguistics is associated with the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at The
Australian National University. Pacific Linguistics was established in 1963 through an initial
grant from the Hunter Douglas Fund. It is a non-profit-making body financed largely from
the sales of its books to libraries and individuals throughout the world, with some assistance
from the School.
The Editorial Board of Pacific Linguistics is made up of the academic staff of         the School’s
Department of Linguistics. The Board also appoints a body of editorial advisors        drawn from
the international community of linguists. Publications in Series A, B and C and        textbooks in
Series D are refereed by scholars with relevant expertise who are normally not         members of
the editorial board.
To date Pacific Linguistics has published over 400 volumes in four series:
Series A:       Occasional Papers; collections of shorter papers, usually on a single topic or
                area.
Series B:       Monographs of intermediate length.
Series C:       Books; publications of greater length, especially reference books such as
                dictionaries and grammars, and conference proceedings.
Series D:       Special Publications; including archival materials, pedagogical works, maps,
                audiovisual productions, and materials that do not fit into the other series.




    Pacific Linguistics would like to assure prospective Australian authors and readers that it
    qualifies as a commercial publisher for The Department of Education, Training and
    Youth Affairs (DETYA) purposes in measuring research output.

   The Pacific Linguistics logo was
designed by Ian Scales after one
small panel of a poro batuna from
V ella L avella, held in the
Australian Museum (A8517). This
is an artefact made from a plaque
of fossilised giant clam shell
(Tridacna sp.), carved into an
elaborate fretwork design. These
particular artefacts were made in
the western Solomon Islands,
probably between 100 and 200
years ago.
   The basic cover design is also by
Ian Scales. The motif was drawn by
Malcolm Ross after the stylised
representation of a design on Lapita
pottery found by Roger Green in the
Reefs-Santa Cruz Islands (source:

   This work represents the combination of two theses written in fulfilment of the degree of
Master of Arts by each of the two authors. The examiners of each thesis raised several
points, which has led to this revised version. Two examiners made comments regarding the
constituent analysis of complement clauses. The implications of these comments have been
considered in both alterations to the original text and throughout various footnotes. One
examiner noted that in the original thesis no mention was made of Foley and VanValin’s
work. This has now been included in such a way as to point out that a traditional
subordination/coordination distinction cannot be maintained in Abun grammar. Several
points raised by the examiners covering a wide range of areas, and of a minor nature have
been addressed in the body of this work.

  The authors would like to acknowledge the help and support of Dr Barry Blake and
Dr Graham Scott, both of LaTrobe University, Melbourne, Australia.
   We are also immeasurably indebted to the Abun people who have become our close
friends over the years as we have learned their language. In particular, we would like to
thank Isak Yekese and his wife, Yemina Yesawen, who have made significant contributions
to our understanding of Abun.

                                     INTRODUCTION



1.1 T he location of the Abun language
  The Abun language is spoken in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, in the northern area of the Bird’s
Head Peninsula. The language is spoken in the subdistricts of Sausapor and Mega. It is
bordered by several other languages: to the east, Amberbaken (also known as Mpur or
Kebar); to the south, Karon Dori (also known as Mare, a dialect of Mai Brat) and Moraid;
and to the west, Moi (as seen on Map 1.1 below).
  There are approximately three thousand speakers who live in eighteen villages, ten on the
coast and eight in the interior, as well as in isolated hamlets.
    There are four identifiable dialects all of which are mutually intelligible, although
intelligibility decreases when greater geographic distance is involved. The names given to the
dialects are those used by the speakers themselves and concern the different terms for the
first person singular pronoun. Further details follow in §1.7.

1.2 The name of the Abun language
   Abun is the name given to the language by the people themselves; a means ‘language’,
and bun means ‘bush, jungle’. They call themselves the Yenden people, ye- ‘person’ and
nden ‘interior, land’. Sometimes they refer to the name of their language as Anden, but more
commonly Abun. Rarely do they call themselves the Yembun people; rather they say that
they, the Yenden people, speak the Abun language.
   The Abun language has been known by various names including Karon Pantai, Madik
and Yimbun. The name Karon Pantai, as it is listed in Voorhoeve (1975a:48), is the name
given to the Abun-speaking people by the Biak people. The Moi people to the west call them
Madik, the meaning of which is uncertain. Voorhoeve (1975a:48) listed the name Madik as a
separate language for what has since been analysed as the Abun Ji dialect (Berry & Berry
1987). The Amberbaken to the east call them the Yimbun, or Yembun, a name which they
obviously acquired from the Yenden themselves. This name is commonly used at the
western end of the language group.
    The Biak name of Karon Pantai relates to the first contact between the two groups. The
Biak people arrived from the island of Biak around the turn of the twentieth century and
settled along the north coast of the Bird’s Head of Irian Jaya, as in map 1.1 above. Their
initial contact with the Abun-speaking people was rather unusual. Some of the Biaks landed
on the mainland and found several Abun-speaking people who had feigned death and
smeared maggots over their bodies. The Abun-speaking people did this in the hope that the
Biaks would just ignore them and leave. But the Biaks soon discovered that they were still
alive. As a result they used the Biak term, Karon, meaning ‘rotten/maggot -eaten’ to describe
the Abun-speaking people. Later a further distinction was made between those who lived
near the coast and those who lived on the Tamrau ranges; thus the addition of the Indonesian
words pantai ‘coast’ and gunung ‘mountain’. So the Biak people called them the Karon
Pantai people, and named their language Karon Pantai as well. The mountain group, which is
a different language group, they named Karon Gunung (listed as Karon Dori by Voorhoeve
 1975a:48).
   It was a common practice for the Biak tribe to denote neighbouring tribes with derogatory
names. The tribe to the east the Biaks referred to as the ‘Amberbaken’, literally the ‘strange
bodies’. These people, who live in the Kebar valley, refer to their language as ‘Mpur’. A tribe
further to the east again the Biaks referred to as the ‘Manikion’ (sometimes spelt as
Manichion). This means ‘dregs of the oil’. This tribe is now referred to as the ‘Soub’. In
colonial times the Biak tribe was promoted by the Dutch who advanced it in their education,
both locally in Dutch New Guinea (as Irian Jaya was then known) and in Holland. For this
reason these derogatory names have come into written use in linguistic articles and
administrative documents.
   For many years the Abun-speaking people did not move out of their tribal homelands
except for war, on slave-raiding parties or to exchange certain goods, in particular the cloth
referred to throughout the entire Bird’s Head region as kain timur ‘eastern cloth’. Even today
the majority of Abun speakers have not left their tribal area and have not ventured out to the
Indonesian towns. Prior to the incorporation of Irian Jaya into Indonesia in 1963, there were
only two documented visits by non-Irianese to the interior of the Abun-speaking area—that
of Reverend Kamma and another by an Ambonese man in an official capacity. This lack of
‘outside contact’ was most likely due to the fact that the Abun still practised cannibalism.
INTRODUCTION                                                                               3

    Therefore in the closest major town, Sorong, the Biak name ‘Karon’ or ‘Karon Pantai’ is
still used to refer to this people. Because it is the only name understood by outsiders (those
who are not Abun speakers), Abun-speaking people will often refer to themselves as ‘Karon’
when talking to outsiders. Even so, Abun-speaking people do not like the name Karon
because of its negative connotations. And since the name, Abun, has now been introduced
into the literature by Silzer and Heikkinen-Clouse (1991) and Grimes (1992), this work will
use Abun as the name for the language spoken by the Yenden people.


1.3 Previous studies
   Abun has received only cursory mention by various authors such as Wurm (1982:206)
and Voorhoeve (1975b:720). Also Voorhoeve (1975a) has word lists for Abun (Karon) and
Abun Ji /!/ dialect (Madik). Berry and Berry (1987) include a report on Abun as one of
several languages surveyed in the west Bird’s Head peninsula.
   This work, therefore, is the first extensive description of Abun grammar.


1.4 Scope of research
   This description is an attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the structure of Abun.
It deals with the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language, including not only
simple clauses but also complex sentences, with attention drawn at many points to
established linguistic universals.
   The present description of basic Abun grammar is based upon data collected during
fieldwork in the Abun area, under the auspices of the cooperative project between
Cenderawasih University of Irian Jaya and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, between
October 1986 and December 1992. The bulk of the data was collected in the villages of
Werur Besar and Sausapor.
   The data used consists of over 35,000 words of transcribed oral texts and 10,000 words of
written Abun text which include traditional stories, narratives, dialogues, speeches and
procedural descriptions.


1.5 The general unguistic situation
1.5.1 Classification ofthe Abun language
   The Abun language is classified as a Papuan language by Wurm (1982:206). It belongs to
the small West Papuan Phylum. It is part of the Bird’s Head Superstock, the Central Bird’s
Head Stock, and more specifically the North Bird’s Head Family, of which Abun and Madik
are listed as members. While Wurm listed Abun and Madik as separate languages, Berry and
Berry (1987) have presented further information regarding lexical similarities and structural
similarities which indicate that Abun and Madik are dialects of the same language. Therefore,
Abun is a family-level isolate in the Central Bird’s Head Stock.
4                                                                                    CHAPTER 1


1.5.2 Papuan versus Austronesian features of the Abun language
   Wurm’s classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird’s
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird’s Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm’s set III (Wurm 1982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun’s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
   Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-past/past) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
   However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan soV word order (Wurm 1982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
    Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.

1.5.3 T he influence of surrounding languages on Abun
   The influence of surrounding languages on Abun has been significant. It is particularly
easy to see the influence of Biak and Indonesian, as will be demonstrated below, but less so
the influence of the three neighbouring languages of Moi, Mpur and Mai Brat (Mare). This is
no doubt because the contact with Biak and Indonesian has been closer and more continuous.
   There are two tribal groups which have migrated to the region where Abun is spoken, the
As and the Biak people. The As language group, who migrated from Gag island before the
turn of the century, came to live in the subdistrict of Mega where the Abun Ji dialect is
spoken. The Biak people, who fled from the island of Biak, came into the Sausapor area in
the early 1900s and have had a significant influence on the language of the Abun people. The
Biak people brought the Christian message to the Abun people and in doing so used many of
their own words and phrases. Words such as rur ‘spirit’, nadi ‘pray’, som ‘worship’ were
introduced from the Biak language. The word for ‘God’, Yefim, has come from the Biak fun
‘respected person’ combined with the Abun personaliser prefix ye- ‘person’. Also many
words for fish and terms related to the sea and seaside have been assimilated from the Biak
language.
   The Abun-speaking people have had contact not only with the Biak people. Trade in kain
timur ‘(antique) eastern cloth’ with neighbouring language groups has had an influence on
Abun. Kain timur is one of the Abun-speaking people’s main tokens of wealth and is used
for paying bride price as well as fines. It originates from East Timor.
   Most villagers stay close to their own village and do not travel far. Even so, the
Indonesian language has found its way to some extent even to the remotest Abun village.
Many Indonesian words also accompanied the introduction of Christianity and government
systems, and have become part of Abun vocabulary. Indonesian words such as selamat
‘save’, ampuni ‘forgive’, perintah ‘command, rule’, desa ‘village’ and berkat ‘bless’ have
been introduced, although Abun speakers seldom understand the meaning of some of these
Indonesian terms.
   Several Indonesian and Biak verbs have been included in common use in Abun even
though in many cases there is an Abun lexical item for the same idea. A bi- prefix, probably
borrowed from the Biak language, is attached to verbs that are introduced from other
languages. All borrowed verbs are verbalised with what could be named, the foreign verb
verbaliser (fvv) prefix. Example 1.1 shows the borrowing of the Indonesian word mengerti
‘understand’; example 1.2 uses the Biak word win ‘sail’.
   1.1      Isak bi-mengerti       suk     gato     nan   ki    ne.
            Isak FW-understand thing which          2sg   say   det
            Isak understands what you are saying.
   1.2      M en bi-win         mu mo    ef.
            I pl FW-sail go loc          island
            Let’s sail to the island.
   Abun-speaking people have borrowed words to handle new concepts such as sailing. In
example 1.2 the word is borrowed from Biak. The Abun people traditionally lived on and
around the Tambrau ranges and so did not have cause to sail anywhere. Other verbs that have
been introduced from Indonesian are tutup ‘close’, buka ‘open’ for closing and opening
6                                                                                    CHAPTER 1


doors. Doors are also a new thing for the Abun. In the past they just had a nu-syo ‘house
opening; doorway’ (lit. house-mouth) with no door as such.
   Often the words borrowed by the Abun speaker do not retain the original pronunciation.
Abun does not have a separate velar nasal phoneme. The velar nasal occurs only medially
preceding a voiced velar plosive. So when words are borrowed such as bunga ‘flower’, the
ng (which represents a velar nasal) is pronounced as a prenasalised plosive by Abun
speakers. When a velar nasal is word-final in borrowed words such as kosong ‘nil, empty,
zero’, it is pronounced as an alveolar nasal, (koson).
   Words borrowed from other languages are also changed in pronunciation, not just
according to Abun phonology, but also because the first ones who heard the words that were
borrowed did not recall and repeat the words accurately. For example, the Biak word farkor
‘study’ was somehow changed to faskor by the speakers of Abun Ji dialect whereas Abun
Ye dialect speakers do not make any change.
   Indonesian conjunctions have also found their way into the Abun language. The main
conjunctions adopted from Indonesian are kalau, ‘if, when’, sebelum ‘before’, barn ‘then (in
colloquial ust)',ja d i ‘so, therefore’. Indonesian conjunctions are frequently used in addition
to Abun conjunctions because the placement of Abun conjunctions in the sentence often
differs from the Indonesian placement. In Indonesian the word sebelum ‘before’ is sentence-
initial, whereas in Abun the expression nde to ‘before’ occurs at the end of the first clause as
in example 1.3 below.
    1.3        M en yo    mu nde to,        men git su-git.
               lPL NEG go        NEG INCAM lPL eat NOM-eat
               Before we go let’s eat.
   The Abun speaker who borrows the Indonesian sebelum ‘before’, also keeps his own
language’s expression for the same idea. So the use of the more redundant form as in
example 1.4 is common.
    1.4        Sebelum men yo          mu   nde     to,    men git su-git.
               before     I pl neg go       neg    incam   I pl eat NOM-eat
               Before we go let’s eat.
   This is not just limited to conjunctions but also to other items such as the Indonesian
prohibition jangan ‘do not’. In Abun, negation requires that yo and nde bracket the predicate
as in example 1.3. In the prohibitive form the yo is omitted. Example 1.5a is the traditional
way of saying ‘Don’t cry!’, but Abun speakers who have been influenced by Indonesian add
jangan, as in 1.5b. However, example 1.5c is unacceptable.
    1.5 a.     Nan wo nde.
               2sg cry neg
               Don’t cry!
          b.   Jangan nan      wo nde.
               do.not 2 sg     cry neg
               Don’t cry!
          c.   *Jangan nan wo.
               do.not     2sg cry
               Don’t cry!
INTRODUCTION                                                                                  1


   Abun speakers have borrowed some Indonesian words to make meanings more specific.
The Abun word jam has the meaning of both ‘to know’ and ‘to understand’, as in examples
1.6 and 1.7. They have equated jam with the Indonesian word tahu ‘to know’, but have
borrowed the Indonesian mengerti ‘to understand’ in many cases to differentiate the two
concepts, as in example 1.7b.
   1.6        Ji jam      an gum.
              lSG know 3sg name
              I know his name.
   1.7 a.     Ji ja m           nan bi       suk-du.
              lSG understand 2sg poss NOM-speak
              I understand what you are saying.
         b.   Ji       bi-mengerti     nan bi        suk-du.
               I sg FVV-understand 2sg poss          NOM-speak
               I understand what you are saying.
   Some borrowed words undergo a shift in meaning from the original meaning in the
source language. For example, even though the Abun have a way to express intensification,
they have borrowed an Indonesian word,jadi ‘to happen, become’ and mixed this with nde
‘not’ to make jadi nde ‘intensifier’. They actually have many ways of expressing
intensification (see §5.5), but they have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the
Indonesian is not standard. The meaning of jadi nde according to its components is ‘did not
happen’. But the meaning given to it is ‘happened very much’, as in example 1.8.
   1.8        An    wo jadi         nde.
              3sg cry happen        neg
              He cried very much.


1.6 Abun and other West Papuan Phylum languages
   The closest language lexically to the Abun language is Mai Brat (and in particular, the
Karon Dori dialect), which is also part of the Central Bird’s Head Stock, but is in a different
family, the Central Bird’s Head Family. Even then the lexical relationship is rather low:
somewhere in the order of 10-15% are cognate depending upon the dialects compared. Berry
and Berry (1987:30) show figures of 6-8% cognate for a dialect of Mai Brat and each of the
three main Abun dialects. This is based on a word list of 200 words. However, when the
Swadesh 100 list is used the percentages tend to be about 5% higher as illustrated in Berry
and Berry (1987:56).
    The other West Papuan Phylum languages show a lexical similarity of 3-6% (Berry &
Berry 1987:30), or about 8-11% based on the 100-word Swadesh list. According to the
critical percentages used for classification of languages based on lexicostatistical comparison
in Voorhoeve (1975a: 16), these other languages would be considered as part of a different
stock to Abun. A figure of 12-27% of shared cognates would result in the classification of
the languages as belonging to the same stock, but different families. So Abun and Mai Brat
belong to one stock, but they are in different families, on the basis of lexical similarity. The
other languages in the West Papuan Phylum in the Bird’s Head belong to other stocks.
8                                                                                      CHAPTER 1


    Phonologically, Abun and other WPP languages are very similar in terms of the number
and types of phonemes and syllable structure. However, there are several differences
between Abun and the closest related language, Mai Brat. Specifically, there is one additional
consonant phoneme in Mai Brat /h/, and a much wider variety of consonant clusters,
including /sr/, /hr/, /rkn/, /mk/, /msy/. /mf/, which do not occur in Abun. Also in Abun, tone
is significant, but not in Mai Brat. To the east, Mpur also has several contrastive tones.
   Syntactically all WPP languages are similar. All have svo sentence structure. Even so,
there are differences between Abun and Mai Brat as revealed in Brown (1990:43-61).
Brown’s paper on nominal phrases alone reveals that Mai Brat has an obligatory subject
person agreement prefix on verbs. According to Wurm (1982:208), “An important structural
and typological feature of the West Papuan Phylum languages is the indication of both
subject and object of the verbs by prefixes, with a masculine-feminine gender distinction in
the 3sg”. This may be true of most other members of WPP, but for Abun there are no such
prefixes on verbs nor is there a masculine-feminine distinction. Abun stands in stark contrast
to other WPP languages at this point.
   An examination of Brown’s examples also reveals that in Mai Brat possessive phrases,
where kinship relationships are involved, the possessor and the possessum are juxtaposed.
However in Abun, a linker, bi is used. Thus there are some significant differences between
Abun and the closest related WPP language, Mai Brat, but most of the basic syntax is
similar. For a more detailed comparison of Abun with other WPP languages in terms of
phonology and syntax see Berry and Berry (1987:30-35).

1.7 A bun dialects
   There are four distinct dialects of Abun. Each one is known by the word used for the first
person singular pronoun in the dialect. The table above lists each dialect together with the
location and estimated number of speakers. Below in Map 1.2 each dialect location can be
seen.
   The two Abun Ji dialects are primarily distinguished by the use of either /r/ or /I/ in their
respective phonemic systems.




i   These figures are from the surveys published in Berry and Berry (1987:59).
INTRODUCTION                                                                                     9

    Each dialect is mutually intelligible, but the greater the distance from each other the greater
is the likelihood of lower intelligibility because the dialects are in a chain from Abun Ji N to
Abun Ji /r/ to Abun Ye to Abun Tat. Thus speakers of Abun Tat from Waibim find it
difficult to understand everything that speakers of Abun Ji N from Mega say. Berry and
Berry (1987:47) list the lexical similarity of Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun Ye (Sausapor) as
86%, Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun Ji /]/ (Mega) as 82%, but Abun Tat (Wau) with Abun Ji /!/
(Metnayam) as 74%. The further away from each other, the lower is the lexical similarity.
Abun Ye speakers, being most central, are in the best position to understand all the other
dialects. The majority of text analysed and discussed in this work is from Abun Ye and
Abun Ji /r/ dialects.

2.1 Introduction
    The sound system of Abun is relatively simple and consists of twenty consonants, five
simple vowels and seven diphthongs. There are also three distinct tones, high/rising, low and
falling.


2.2 Consonants
   The consonant phonemes of Abun are displayed in Table 2.1 below.

2.2.1   P lo siv es

    Plosives are differentiated by voicing and prenasalisation at four different points of
articulation. Plosives are distinguished from the other consonants in that they are
[-continuant, -sonorant]. Phonetically the palatal plosives are affricates. Plosives are
differentiated by the features listed in Table 2.2 below.

   There is a gap in the consonant phoneme chart because a voiceless palatal (/ts/) does not
occur as a separate phoneme. A voiceless palatal affricate [ts] occurs in the Abun Ji dialect on
occasion in free variation with the palatal fricative [s] as in example 2.1. At this time there are
no contrasts but only free variation between these two. In the future the voiceless palatal
affricate [ts] may be added to the inventory of Abun phonemes due to the influence of
Indonesian, where both the palatal fricative and this palatal affricate contrast.
   2.1       /se/        [se ~tse]           big
             /seSa/      [sesa - tsetsa]     go out
    Futhermore, in the Abun Tat dialect to the east there is no separate /j/. In that dialect [j] is
in free variation with [y] as in example 2.2.
   2.2       /jam/             [jam ~ yam]                         understand
             /sukjimnot/       [sukjimnot ~ sukyimnot]             love
   Neither does the /nj/ phoneme occur in the Abun Tat dialect. Rather it is an allophone of
Ini as in example 2.3.
   2.3       /nje/            [nje ~ ne]                  people
             /suknjep/        [suknjep ~ sunep]           gentle
   Affricates are widely attested in the world’s languages according to Ruhlen (1976:141).
He found that 70% of languages he studied had affricates. However, in the Indo-Pacific area
only 28% of languages studied had affricates. Abun did not have affricates [tS], [j] and [nj] in
the past, but in recent years, with the influence of the national language, Indonesian, these are
becoming distinct phonemes. To date, only [j] and [nj] have achieved this.
   Prenasalised plosives are analysed as units. They could have been analysed as consonant
clusters to make the phonemic inventory simpler, but this reason does not have a place in
linguistic analysis and description according to Herbert (1986:76). An attempt has been made
to discover “what is, in some sense, psychologically ‘real’ for the native speaker”, as Herbert
puts it. There are several reasons that could be advanced to support the unit interpretation
including: timing considerations, irreversibility of the components and sonority hierachy
considerations; but the most significant is syllable structure considerations, in particular an
analysis of word-initial consonant clusters. The only non-suspect word-initial consonant
clusters are /pr/, /br/, /fr/, /kr/ and /gr/. No non-suspect examples of CCC clusters occur
word-initially. Therefore, in examples such as mb re ‘antique cloth’, /mb/ must be interpreted
as a unit because no non-suspect CCC pattern exists. This is in accordance with Pike
(1947:60) in his fourth premiss, which says that “Characteristic sequences of sounds exert
structural pressure on the phonemic interpretation of suspicious segments or suspicious
12                                                                                    CHAPTER 2


sequences of segments”. Thus /mb/ and the other prenasalised plosives have been interpreted
as complex units. Having said that, it is possible to interpret the prenasalised plosives as two
distinct phonemes depending upon one’s concept of phoneme. That would result in a smaller
inventory of consonants. However, to include them in the list gives, in our opinion, a much
better description of the language by making this clear.
   The feature of prenasalised plosives is found chiefly in Indo-Pacific languages and the
Nilo-Saharan languages according to Ruhlen (1976:140). Of the 693 languages Ruhlen
(1976) studied, 10% have this feature, whereas in these two areas 36% of the languages
studied had prenasalised plosives. Of the eight ways that prenasalisation may interact with
voicing, the most common systems are ‘p mb’ and ‘p b mb’, accounting for 31 and 30 of the
languages respectively. The full system of ‘p mp b mb’ was found only in five languages and
‘p mp b’ in two. Other possible systems such as ‘mp b’, <mp mb \ ‘p nip mb’ and l,np b mb’ were
neither found nor expected. Abun fits the ‘p b mb’ system.
   All plosives occur word-initially and word-medially, but not all occur word-finally.
Contrasts between voiced and the voiceless plosives are neutralised word-finally, that is,
voiceless plosives occur word-finally, but voiced and prenasalised plosives do not.
     Examples of plosives :
              [pet]            /pet/          to split
              [gap]            /gap/          mouse
              [napawa]         /napawa/       remember
              [but]            /but/          to arrest
              [tekto]          /tekto/        for
              [git]            /git/          to eat

2.2.2 F ricatives
    There are three voiceless fricatives in the Abun language and no voiced ones. Fricatives
are distinguished from the other consonants in that they are [+continuant, -sonorant]. All
fricatives occur word-initial, medial and final with the exception of /§/ which neutralises to /s/
syllable-finally. They are differentiated as follows:

              [mofit]        /mofit/       seven
              [kaf]          /kaf/         crab

              [sesar]        /sesar/       to go out


2.2.3 N asals
    Nasals are distinguished from other consonants in that they are [-continuant, +sonorant].
All nasals occur word-initial, medial and final with the exception of /n/, which neutralises to
/n/ word-finally. The three nasals are differentiated by the same features as fricatives, as seen
in Table 2.4 below:
                                          TABLE2.4: NASALS
                                               m          n          n
                              anterior         +          +          -
                              coronal          -          +          +


   Examples of nasals:
   2.6        [men]          /men/        we
              [tarn]         /tarn/       to story
              [nak]          /nak/        below
              [jtmnot]       /jimnot/     love
              [san]          /sanI        cloth
              [nak]          /nak/        diarrhea


2.2.4 Glides
   There are three glides in Abun, /w r y/. Glides are distinguished from other consonants
because they are [+continuant, +sonorant], and from the vowels because they are [-syllabic].
The /w/ has been listed at the labial point of articulation because it functions more like the
labial stops morphophonemically. For example, when the prefix suk- is added to a stem
beginning with the velar stops, the fk/ is elided. However, when suk- is added to a stem
beginning with labials /b p w/, the /k/ is not elided. The /r/ is actually a trill, but in fast speech
  14                                                                                                         CHAPTER 2


  often becomes flap. The glides are differentiated by the same features as for fricatives and
  nasals, as listed in Table 2.5 below:

                                                       TABLE2.5: GLIDES
                                                              W         r        y
                                         anterior             +             +            -
                                         coronal              -             +            +


     Glides occur word-initial, medial and final as in the examples below. There are no final
  consonant clusters.
                     [re]          /re/            this
                     [fro]         /fro/           to prepare

                     [sur]         /sur/           water
                     [Wl]          /wf/            scorpion
                     [duwe]        /duwe/          to say

  2.3 Vowels
     The five Abun vowels are distinguished from the consonants because they are [+syllabic],
  and by inference [-Fcontinuant, +sonorant]. They form a typical five-vowel system as
  displayed in Table 2.7.
PHONOLOGY                                                                                      15

                       Low                                                    a


   The following table shows the distinctive features of these five vowels:

   Abun vowels tend to be more tense when in open syllables or when tone is high. For the
high vowels, HI and Id, tensing is particularly noticeable in open syllables as seen in example
2.8. For the mid vowels, Id and lol, tensing is more noticeable when tone is high, as in
example 2.9. Abun’s one low vowel, /a/, has no perceptible allophonic variations.

             [kuk]                  /kuk/               to swallow
             [ut]                   /ut/                to stick

             [ot]                   /ot/                number

             [sem]                  /sem/               to sleep
             [sem]                  /sem/               salt water
             [be]                   /be/                kangaroo
             [be]                   /be/                later
   There are also seven complex syllable peaks (diphthongs) in Abun— [ai], [au], [ei], [eu],
[oi], [ou] and [ui]. These could be interpreted as single units consisting of movement from
lower to higher (ai, au, ei, eu, oi and ou) or back to front (ui). However, they have been
interpreted as VC clusters on the basis that they never occur before a consonant within a
syllable. Indeed, a unit interpretation is also viable based on non-suspect syllable patterns, but
the absence of a CVC syllable, where the V is a diphthong, is significant. Thus for this
16                                                                                    CHAPTER 2


reason diphthongs, which are not very common in Abun, have been interpreted as sequences
of VC clusters.
     Example of diphthongs:
     2.10     [nau]            /naw/          palm wine
              [weu]            Avew/          banana
              [ko‘]            /koy/          short
              [ahna]           /ay.na/        moon
              [Aba'dim]        /Abaydim/      Abaydim (name)


2.4 Syllable structure
   Although some linguists doubt the reality of the syllable as a phonologically definable
linguistic unit (Herbert 1986:67), it is a useful aid in description. In Abun, syllable structure
may be given simply as (C)(C)V(C). This assumes the definition of a syllable as a sequence
of sounds containing one peak of prominence. The peak is represented by a vowel.
   The most common syllable is CV. Any consonant can occur in the syllable onset of this
type of syllable. Also any of the five vowels can occur as the peak. The only restriction is that
wu is unacceptable. All consonants may be absent, resulting in simple V syllables. Examples
of these two syllable types are listed in example 2.11 below:
     2.11     V                 l\l              sick
              CV                Isul             long
              v.cv              I'd.nal          that one
              cv.cv             Imo.rel          here
              v.cv.cv           /o.nde.wo/       however
              cv.cv.cv          /su.be.re/       so that
   The next most common syllable type is CVC. The onset can be any consonant and the
peak is any one of the five vowels. The coda is limited to the phonemes / p t k f s m n w ry/,
that is voiceless obstruents, nasals and glides. The obstruent III and the nasal /n/ are
neutralised to Is/ and Ini respectively in the coda position. The initial consonant may be
absent, resulting in VC syllables. Examples of these syllable types are listed in example 2.12
below:
     2.12     CVC               Ikaml            sun
              VC                /on/             stomach
              vc.cv             /ay.na/          moon

    The least common syllable patterns are CCV and CCVC, where the first element of the
CC cluster consists of one of eight phonemes listed below in Table 2.9. Either of the glides,
Irl or /w/ can be the second element, however the glide /y/ does not occur in this position
(+ means occurs, - means does not occur).

                          TABLE2.9: WORD-INITIALCONSONANTCLUSTERS

                                            r         w
                                 p         +          -
                                 b         +          -
                                mb         +          -
                                 f         +          -

                                 m          -         +


   The first consonant in these clusters is always [-coronal]. The [-coronal] consonants /m/
and /w/ are not found in the non-suspect clusters with Irl, but they are distinguished from the
other [-coronal] consonants because both Iml and /w/ are sonorant. Thus non-suspect CC
clusters in Abun are in general made up of:
              C     +    C
             [-cor]      Irl
             [-son]
   However, when the second element is /w/, then the first consonant is usually
[-anterior].
   There is only one exception to this, and that is the existence of /mw/. There are very few
words beginning with /mw/. It is possible that these may have been introduced from the
Amberbaken language to the east. The word used for ‘many’ in Abun Ji dialect is ok, while
in Abun Tat it is mwa. The other /mw/ words also figure more prominently in the Abun Tat
dialect, which is at the western extremity of the Abun language.
  Examples of the CCV and CCVC types of syllables are listed in example 2.13 below:
18                                                                                                            CHAPTER 2

   Apart from consonant clusters commencing a syllable, there are clusters across syllable
boundaries. The first element must be one of the eight phonemes that are in the coda position
of a syllable as listed vertically in Table 2.10. The second component can be one of 20
phonemes as displayed horizontally in the table below.

      We can make the following observations from Table 2.10:
      1.       Geminate clusters do not occur. Several other consonants are analogous to geminate
               clusters such as a voiceless plosive followed by a voiced plosive (/pb/, /td/, /tj/, /kg/),
               fricatives with other fricatives (/fs/, /fs/, /sf/, /ss/) and the cluster /nil/ does not occur.
      2.       Apart from geminate clusters, the fk/ phoneme precedes all consonants word-
               medially, with the exception that a word-medial /kn/ has not yet been found in the
               data to date. The only prefix in Abun ending with a consonant is suk- ‘nom’. This
               may account for the fact that virtually all consonants follow /kl.
      3.       Nasals before prenasalised plosives are elided. Nasals do not always assimilate word-
               medially to a following oral or nasal stop, such as in semda ‘dream’, benbot ‘do
               according to’Jamgwatu ‘sweet potato' ,jamni ‘sweet potato (variety)’.
      4.       Plosives, nasals and the glide /r/ may all be followed by fricatives.
      5.       Nasals are not followed by/r/.
      6.       Only the /k/ phoneme precedes prenasalised plosives.
PHONOIXXj Y                                                                                      19

   7.     Both /s/ and M followed by /y/ word-medially become /§/ and /n/ respectively.
   8.     There are many blank spaces left because Abun has a large proportion of
          monosyllabic words (see §3.1), and although a particular combination does not occur
          in the data to date, the possibility is not ruled out. Words with /p f ii y w/ medially are
          rather uncommon thus resulting in many ‘0’ spaces in those rows and columns.
  A cluster of three consonants word-medially is rare in Abun. The only cases found in over
100.000 words of data to date are listed in example 2.14 below:
   2.14         /sap.kwa/              tongs
                /jam.gwa.sem/          manioc
                /mas.kwa/              angry
                /suk.mbraw/            decoration


2.5 Morphophonemic rules
2.5.1     k DELETION
   The voiceless velar stop /k/ is deleted before velar stops in normal speech.
                   k->0/_            C

                /suk+kos/     —¥ /sukos/ song


2.5.2 Nasal deletion
   The nasal of a prenasalised stop is elided where prenasalised stops are preceded by a nasal
across word boundaries, according to the following rule.
              C                          C      /         C      #_
        [+nas, -son]                   [-nas]         [+nas, -i-son]

                /an#mbau/                 /an bau/    he is well
   The two pronouns, nan ‘2sg’ and men ‘I pl’ are exceptions to the norm in that the final
nasal is deleted at the word boundary when it is followed by a vowel, a voiceless consonant
or a nasal.
            C      -»       0        ___#V
          [+nas]                     ___ #C [-vd]

                /nan#ma/        —»        /na ma/      come
   For these two pronouns only, a word-final nasal assimilates to the point of articulation of a
following voiced stop across word boundaries as in the following rule:
20                                                                                     CHAPTER 2

              /nan#gwat/      —>     [nag gwat]      /nan gwat/   bring


2.5.3 rDELETION
  The alveolar glide Ixl is deleted preceding morpheme boundaries. The only instances
observed involve the form /sur/ ‘water’ which forms compounds with the names of rivers
and creeks.
                r —» 0 / __ +
     2.19     /sur+nju/     —>     /sunju/ Nju river
              /sur+yan/     —>     /sSuyan/ Yan river


2.6 Stress
   In Abun, stress is predictable. Stress occurs on the last syllable of each word. The
following examples illustrate this. Stress is indicated by ' preceding the stressed syllable.
              /ye.'bris/         male
              /bo.'ge/           fish
              /kwe.'nu/          tree sap
              /f.'bit/           bad
              /no.wa.'rek/       lightning
              /man.gor.'es/      spinach


2.7 T one
    Tone in Abun has a low functional load and may be disappearing as a useful contrastive
feature. There are three contrastive tones, high/rising, low, and falling. In this section, high or
rising tone is marked with an acute accent mark above the vowel of the syllable, falling tone
is marked with a grave accent, and low tone is unmarked. Elsewhere in this work, tone is
marked only where it is germane to the discussion, as normally the context makes it clear to
an Abun speaker what tone is required. In example 2.21a /on/ has a falling tone, whereas in
example 2.21c /on/ has a low tone. In example 2.21a /buk/ has a low tone, whereas in 2.21b
/buk/ has a rising tone.
PHONOLOGY                                                                                    21

   2.21 a. An dn            buk.
            3sg stomach tight
            She is pregnant.
   2.21 b. An on         buk.
            3sg stomach lump
           He has a stomach lump.
   2.21 c. An on       buk.
           3sg stools tight
           He needs to defecate.
  The three-way distinction of tones can be seen in the following examples, but in 2.22a the
word se is a verb, while in the other two examples it is an adjective.
   2.22 a. Sur    se.
           water flow
           The water flows.
   2.22 b. sur      se
           water flood
           a big flood
   2.22 c. sur      se
           water big
           a big river
   Other sets where tone affects the lexical meaning of Abun words are i ‘(be) sick’ and /
‘(be) happy’; ndb ‘good’ and ndo ‘bitter’. There are very few minimal pairs in the same
word class, so the functional load borne by tone in Abun is very low.
   Tone is also used in some instances to indicate plurality. The most common use of tone
here is to differ between the singular and plural forms of the third person pronoun, in which
‘3pl’ is /an/ with a rising tone, while ‘3sg’ is /an/ with a low tone, as in example 2.23. Other
examples of where high/rising tone is used to pluralise are seen in example 2.24.
   2.23      /an bro sugft/ he boils the food
             /an bro sugft/ they boil the food
   2.24      /ndam/    bird                            /ndam/ birds
             /nu/      house                           /nu/   houses
             /gw a/    taro tuber                      /gwa/ taro tubers
  Tone sandhi also occurs in Abun. Ladefoged (1993:255-256) says,
      Even in a tone language the pitch of the voice changes continuously...
      assimilations occur between tones in much the same way as they do between
      segments. When a high tone precedes a low tone, then the low tone will usually
      begin with a downward pitch change... There seems to be a tendency in the
      languages of the world for tone assimilations to be perseverative—the tone of
      one syllable hanging over into that of later syllables—rather than anticipatory...
  In Abun, where a high/rising tone precedes a low tone, the low tone begins with a
downward pitch, that is, it appears to be like a falling tone, but not falling as much as a true
22                                                                                      CHAPTER 2


falling tone. So, in example 2.25a, when /ma/ is preceded by /an/ it has a falling tone, but
when it is preceded by /an/ as in example 2.25b, /ma/ has a level low tone.
             An ma       mo-re           re.
             3pl come Loc-here           PERF
             They have come here.
             An ma       mo-re           re.
             3sg come Loc-here           PERF
             He has come here.
   When a low or falling tone precedes a high tone, the high tone begins with an upward
pitch, like a rising tone, whereas elsewhere it is a high tone. The particle, /ft/ in example
2.26a, although normally a high tone, has a rising variant in this case due to the influence of
/jam/, which has a falling tone. When /jam/ is replaced with /git/, which has a high tone, as in
example 2.26b, /ft/ also has a level high tone.
     2.26 a. An     jam     it.
              3sg know CAM
              He finally knows.
     2.26 b. An     git it.
              3sg eat cam
              He finally ate.


2.8 The orthography of Abun
   The orthography used in the remainder of this work uses the phonemic symbols presented
in the consonant and vowel charts (Tables 2.1 and 2.7 above), with the exceptions that /s/ is
written as sy, and /n/ is written as ny. Also diphthongs such as /au/, /eu/, /o'/ and /a'/, although
interpreted earlier as CV, are written as au, eu, oi and ai respectively. This then reflects the
practical orthography used in Abun, which is in line with Indonesian orthography.

                        MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES



   Traditionally major classes of words that are grammatically distinguished in a language
have been called parts of speech. In this chapter, after a brief discussion of morphological
typology (§3.1), we will explore the parts-of-speech distinctions that are significant for the
Abun language (§3.2), the components of each word class and their formation (§§3.3 and
3.4).
   Of particular interest is the analytical or isolating nature of the Abun language which
therefore has very little affixation and has, as a result, a prominent role of closed function
word classes.
   In addition, many of the free forms in Abun are undergoing the process of
grammaticalisation to become affixes, since they focus on grammatical function rather than
lexical meaning. These free forms are handled together with the affixes in this description of
Abun morphology.


3.1 T ypology
   The Abun language is best classified as an isolating or analytic language, since it largely
has a one-to-one correspondence between words and morphemes as is illustrated by the
following sentence:
  3.1       M en ben suk         mo nggwe yo, men ben suk             sino.
            I pl do     thing loc garden then I pl do           thing together
            If we do things at the garden, then we do them together.
   Furthermore, words in Abun are mostly monosyllabic. A sampling of the first 200 words
in five stories, each by a different speaker, reveals that 80.8% of the words are monosyllabic,
17.8% have two syllables and only 1.4% have three or more.
   In relation to morphological typology, Comrie (1989:46) discusses two indices, the index
of synthesis and the index of fusion, the most significant for Abun being index of synthesis.
This index has two extremes. At one extreme are isolating languages, which have a one-to-
one correspondence between morphemes and words. At the other extreme are polysynthetic
languages which have a high level of morpheme-to-word ratio. Each language fits
somewhere along this continuum. Abun is particularly noteworthy because it is very close to
the isolating end of the spectrum. Examples of affixation and word compounding exist, but
the vast majority of Abun words consist of only one morpheme. Analysis of the sample
mentioned above reveals an average morpheme-to-word ratio of 1:1.13. This compares with
English 1:1.68, Sanskrit 1:2.59 and, at the other end of the scale, Eskimo with 1:3.72 (Lyons
1968:188).

   The second index that Comrie discusses is the index of fusion, which measures the extent
to which morphemes within the word are readily segmentable, with the extremes being
agglutination and fusion. The few affixes which occur in Abun are easily segmentable. There
is some slight variability of morpheme shape predictable in terms of general phonological
rules discussed in §2.5. Abun, then, has an agglutinating morphology within its relatively
small amount of polymorphemic words. Very little fusion is evident.
   Comrie (1989:46ff.) discusses several languages in relation to the index of fusion
including Turkish, Hungarian and Russian. Turkish is relatively agglutinating, Hungarian
exhibits more fusion, and Russian even more fusion again. Abun, however, is more like
Turkish in that it is close to the agglutinating end of the continuum.
   Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
   The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
   Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronominal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1986).
   The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather limited. The following
processes are evident: limited suffixation on verbs (§3.3.1); three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3.2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3.4).


3.2 E stablishing word classes
   In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be defined after a
discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.
    In establishing the parts-of-speech classification for the Abun language, grammatical
criteria have been employed, namely the word’s distribution, its range of syntactic functions
and the morphological or syntactical categories for which it is specifiable. These criteria are
listed by Schachter (1985:3), who states they are not open to the objections of unclear
application that traditional definitions are.
   Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical criteria, they
are given a label that reflects their characteristics. For example, words that express actions,
processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word class is decided upon after the
word class has been established.
MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES                                                                25

   Honey (1972:277) makes the point that “the object of the grammarian is to establish
categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make the most
comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical statements...”. Honey
developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he established his system of word classes
for Vietnamese (which is also an analytical language like Abun) on the basis of positional
relationships of certain selected words and/or classes of words. Some of his methods have
been applied in order to establish a set of word classes for Abun.
   The word classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes. Open classes
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that is in principle unlimited.
Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conjunctions, proforms,
particles and interjections, have a fixed and generally small number of words.


3.3 Open word classes
   There are four open word classes discussed below, verbs (§3.3.1), nouns (§3.3.2),
adjectives (§3.3.3) and adverbs (§3.3.4), as shown in Table 3.1 below.
   According to Schachter (1985:4), the distinction between nouns and verbs is one of the
few universal parts-of-speech distinctions. Regarding the distribution of nouns in Abun, they
may directly follow or precede the possessive linker bi but never directly follow the predicate
marker yo. Conversely, verbs never directly follow bi but may directly follow yo.
   Adjectives are distinguished from nouns and verbs in §3.3.3. Many adjectives do double
duty as adverbs and there are several other distinct adverb subclasses discussed in §3.3.4.

3.3.1 Verbs
   Verbs in Abun have three subclasses: transitive, intransitive and ditransitive. These
subclasses are distinguishable on the basis that intransitive verbs do not occur with objects,
transitive verbs do; whereas ditransitive verbs occur with an object as well as an ‘indirect
26                                                                                  CHAPTER 3


object’ in the form of a prepositional phrase. A subclass of intransitive verbs can be
transformed into transitive verbs by the suffixation of -wa.
   Suffixation on verbs is relatively limited in Abun. Four suffixes occur, three of these
resulting from grammaticalisation of prepositions, and the fourth from the coalescence of an
adverb. The following table lists verb suffixes:

                                 TABLE3.2: ABUNVERBSUFFIXES

                             Suffix            Meaning
                               -wa        transitive/benefactive
                              -bot        extends scope
                               -ket       various
                              -gat        intensifier


   Three of the suffixes that occur with verbs come from the prepositions, wa benefactive,
bot perlative and ket ‘along’. These three prepositions occur in their free form, but also they
have become attached to some verbs and nouns with which they frequently co-occur. For
example, the benefactive preposition has become affixed to some verbs to form verbs that
have a different meaning incorporating a benefactive notion. Likewise, the other two
prepositions have also become affixed to some verbs. This procedure follows the
grammaticalisation principle of divergence proposed by Hopper (1991:22), “when a lexical
form undergoes grammaticization to a clitic or affix, the original form may remain as an
autonomous element...” Indeed the original form of each of these prepositions has remained
as an autonomous element, but it has also changed to become an affix. The change of status
from a free-form preposition to an affix is based on the grounds of both prosody and
meaning change of the resultant form. The fourth suffix is derived from the adverb gat
‘intensity’. The grammaticalisation of each affix is discussed below.


3.3.1.1 T he grammaticalisation of wa
   One of the suffixes that is an inflection on verbs or derives verbs from nouns is -wa. This
sulfix has resulted from the lexical form, wa ‘benefactive’, undergoing grammaticalisation.
    Frequently the free-form wa is separated from the verb as in example 3.2. It is common
also for wa to be adjacent to the verb, and in these cases coalescence results in a semantic
shift as well as a change in prosody. This occurs because the object is frequently omitted in
Abun grammar, leaving the verb adjacent to wa. The preposition does not coalesce in all
cases, but particularly when the interpretation of the verb and wa is no longer compositional,
it is clear that wa has become the suffix -wa. According to Anderson (1985:42), the inflected
verb, once formed, is then like all words, subject to shift, specialisation, generalisation and
other changes of meaning. The inflected form is seen in example 3.3 as well as in example
3.4.
     3.2     An fro          nu      yo wa men.
             3sg prepare house a ben I pl

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES                                                                       27

              I pl cook-BEN house Sunday
              We celebrated (the opening of) the church.
   The suffix -w a has two basic uses in Abun. One transitivises intransitive verbs and the
other changes the meaning of transitive verbs to include a benefactive notion.
   There are several intransitive verbs that may be transitivised by the addition of the suffix
-w a. Verbs likt n y u ‘(be) fearful’, i ‘(be) happy’, f o ‘(be) unclean’, ti ‘stand’, k e m ‘sit’ are
transitivised in this way. Examples 3.5 and 3.7 show intransitive forms, while examples 3.6
and 3.8 show transitive forms. In example 3.8, the form k e m is shortened to ke. Shortening
of this type is a common practice among Abun speakers, even though normally the nasal
would not be elided as seen in example 3.9 below.
   3.5       Ji        nyu.
             I sg fear

             night det 3indef sit-TRS Lamber morning
             That night they guarded Lamber’s (body until) the morning.
   The transitive verb s y im - w a ‘shut’ can be derived by the suffixation of -w a to the noun
syim ‘hand’ as in example 3.9.

   3.9       Isa k  syim-wa n u -sy o .
             Isak hand-TRS house-mouth
             Isak shut the door.
    In addition to transitivising some intransitive verbs and nouns, the suffixation of -w a to
transitive verbs changes the meaning to include a benefactive notion. In example 3.10, the
transitive verbs m e ‘see’ and the preposition w a have combined to form the inflected word,
m e w a ‘take care o f in example 3.11. The benefactive notion combined with ‘seeing’ the
canoe results in the idea of ‘taking care o f the canoe.
   3.10                me k w e m .
             M a r in u s
             Marinus see canoe
             Marinus saw the canoe.

                 Marinus see-BEN canoe
                 Marinus takes care of the canoe.
   Similarly the verb ko n ‘cook’ and w a coalesce to result in a different meaning. In example
3.12, the transitive verb k o n ‘cook’ is used in its normal sense, but if we cooked food for
Isak then the benefactive preposition would be a free form as in example 3.13. However, to
celebrate something, which comes from the idea of cooking for something, results in the
suffixation of -w a as in example 3.14.
     3.12        M e n kon           su -g it.
                 I pl cook NOM-eat
                 We cooked food.
     3.13        M e n kon   s u -g it  wa                    Is a k .
                 I pl cook NOM-eat ben                        Isak
                 We cooked food for Isak.
     3.14        M e n kon-wa               nu         ari.
                 I pl cook-BEN house Sunday
                 We celebrated (the opening of) the church.
     Other verbs that change in their semantic scope as a result of the suffixation of -w a are:
      3.15         bi                     give                              biwa                   pay for
                   ki                     say                               kiwa                   ask for
                   napa                   recall                            napawa                 remember
    There are also a few verbs that no longer have an uninflected form such as s y a r e tw a ‘to
listen to’; re w a ‘to deny’; sa k a n w a ‘to meet at a nominated location not at either person’s
home’; and esw a ‘to wait for’. The forms, syaret, re, sa ka n and es no longer occur.


3.3.1.2     T he GRAMMATICALISATION OVbot

   B o t, too, has undergone a process of grammaticalisation. The free form b o t is a perlative
preposition, meaning ‘along, about or through’. In example 3.16 below, the normal use of
this preposition as ‘about’ is shown.
     3.16        Pa                  s ik e r    nok             bot         k w a -y o -k w a -y o .
                 young.man tease wild.pig perl thing-a-thing-a
                 The young men teased the wild pig about many things.
   The form b o t has in many cases become combined with verbs. The resultant forms have a
different semantic scope when compared to the uninflected forms, for example w a t
‘separate’ and w a tb o t ‘examine’ in examples 3.17 and 3.18. The uninflected w a t means
‘separate’, while w a tb o t contains the perlative notion of separating about or along a particular
path.
     3.17        N ggon         we     w at        nok                   onyar,       i       be         onyar     i.

                 intestines.

             3sg separate-PERL book
             She studies the book.
   Some verbs that combine with bot and have meaning changes to include a perlative notion
are:
             wat      separate/divide                 wat-bot       examine
            ja m      know, understand               jam-bot        believe

             is       go down                         is-bot        go down along


3.3.1.3 The grammaticalisation ofket
    Ket also follows the same grammaticalisation procedure as bot and wa. The free form ket
is a locative preposition. It precedes the location of the path of the action. For example, the
location where goods were being carried in example 3.20 is along the ground, that is by foot,
and the location of the path of the cutting across in example 3.21 was towards the interior
(rather than the sea).
   3.20      M en sam suk           ket bur.
             I pl carry things loc earth
             We carried the things, walking along.
   3.21      M en tot ket nden.
             I pl cut to e interior
             We cut across to the interior (path).
   As stated above, objects are frequently omitted in Abun, resulting in the preposition ket
being adjacent to a verb. This has resulted in the combining of some verbs with ket with a
subsequent semantic shift. The free form ket occurs adjacent to the verbs mu ‘go’, ti ‘stand’,
tot ‘cut’, and e ‘fall over’, but there is no evidence of semantic shift or change of prosody in
these cases, so ket remains as a free form and is not affixed to these verbs. However, ket has
become a suffix in the case of the two adjectives mbrin ‘unconscious’ in example 3.22 and
ye ‘difficult’ in example 3.23. This is clear because of both prosody and significant meaning
changes in these two examples. Another example of a change of meaning is the suffixation
of -ket with the verb ki ‘say’. The resultant word is ki-ket ‘slander’.
   3.22      Ji mbrin-ket            nan gum re.

3.3.1.4 T he grammaticalisation of gat
   The free form gat ‘to spear, join’ is a regular verb as in example 3.24, and it also behaves
as an adverb meaning that an action is done with intensity or penetratingly. In example 3.25,
gat signifies that the act of entering new students of witchcraft into the training house was not
just at its old pace, but that now there was a new emphasis on doing it, and that emphasis
was more intense.
     3.24    M usa gat     nok.

             Musa speared the wild pig.

             3sg enter young.men PERS-knowledge det its-new int
             He is putting in young men (to train as) shamen, lots of new ones.
   Adverbs follow the object in Abun clauses. Since objects are frequently elided, the adverb
often directly follows the verb, just like the prepositions wa, bot and ket. Some verbs and
nouns undergo prosody and semantic changes when they co-occur with the adverb gat, and
so they coalesce. In these cases, the semantic changes are not always equal to the
compositional meaning of the components. However, the inflected verbs do have notions of
intensity or pressure. The conversion of status from a free form (the adverb) to an inflection
on the verb is clear due to prosody and semantic changes. In example 3.26, the verb wer ‘to
try (to seduce)’ combines with -gat to form wer-gat ‘make a determined effort, work hard
at’. Likewise the verb ki ‘speak’, combined with -gat, forms kigat ‘speak persuasively’.
Furthermore, the verb i ‘(be) sick’ combines to form i-gat ‘(be) frequently sick’ in example
3.27.
     3.26    An    wer-gat     an    baca.
             3sg push-iNT 3sg read
             S/he pushed herself/himself intensely to be able to ready.
     3.27    An     yo    i-gat     saga nyim        nde    re.
             3sg neg sick-lNT like          before neg      perf
             She is not always sick like she had been.
   An alternative analysis is to consider this as word compounding, where it is actually the
verb gat that is coalescing with another verb. Sentences like example 3.28 show that indeed
both the verb and adverb gat can occur in the one clause. The verb makes clear that they are
spearing each other and the adverb conveys the manner in which they were doing it. In fact,
ndi and gat in example 3.28 are not compounding; rather both verbs stand alone on prosody
grounds, and there is certainly no change of compositional meaning compared to each verb’s
meaning when they occur in this way. This is a case of serial verbs. In contrast to this, when
the adverb and a verb co-occur coalescence results. So in example 3.29, the -gat in ndi-gat
refers to the intensity of fighting. Instead of an independent stress centre on each morpheme
the primary stress is on -gat, according to the stress patterns found in Abun words.
     3.28    An w e ndi         gat    yu            gat.
             3pl two fight spear each.other int
             They (two) fought, spearing each other furiously.

               They (two) fought furiously.
   A few nouns have also combined with -g a t to form verbs, such as: s y im - g a t ‘hand-iNT: to
start’ and sy o -g a t ‘mouth-iNT: to order’.

              3sg    mouth-iNT child sit
              He ordered the child to sit.
    Some verbs no longer have the uninflected forms in the language. For example, the form
sy a u g a t ‘to command’ occurs, but sy a u does not.



3.3.2 N ouns
   Within the noun class there are five distinct subclasses: proper nouns, common nouns,
compound nouns, body parts, and relator nouns, the last two of these subclasses being closed
ones. Proper nouns, which together with pronouns always directly precede b i ‘possessive
linker’ when b i co-occurs, consist of words such as names of people or places. They are
distinguished from common nouns in that they never occur after the possessive linker. The
subclass of body parts occurs in inalienable possessive constructions and is juxtaposed to the
possessor; see §5.3 for more details.
   Nouns are in general a single morpheme, but can also consist of multiple morphemes.
Multiple morphemes are derived from single morpheme nouns or some other form classes
through the processes of affixation and compounding.
  There are three p r e fix e s on nouns; a nominaliser, suk-', a personaliser, ye-', and i-, a
possessive pronoun prefix for non-human referents, which replaces the whole of a non­
human whole-part relationship in compound nouns. They are listed in Table 3.3 below:

                                           TABLE3.3: ABUNNOUNPREFIXES

                                i-          subclass               part of whole


   Since both s u k and y e also occur as free forms, an alternative analysis would be to
describe them as being used in forming noun compounds.2 However, the choice of prefix is

2    It appears that this dilemma is common; to quote Anderson (1985:45), “The line between
     compounding and stem modification is not always easy to draw... but this is not a matter of major
     importance since the division is primarily a matter of convenience” .
32                                                                                     CHAPTER 3


preferred here because all three prefixes involved convey grammatical rather than lexical
information. Furthermore, affixes may also exist as free forms, such as in in the English
in p u t.



3.3.2.1 T henominaliser, suk-
   In the same way that the prepositions discussed above are grammaticalised, the free lexical
form s u k ‘thing’ has also undergone grammaticalisation to become a nominalising prefix.
The following examples show that the free form su k can mean ‘thing’, not further defined as
in example 3.32, or ‘possessed thing’ as in example 3.33. This free form is also used in a
pronominal way to refer back to a situation, or certain inanimate things. In example 3.34, s u k
refers to a list of items including cassowary, blackbird and possum.
     3.32       M e kon       suk       su        syur.
                I pl cook thing with water
                We cook things in water.
     3.33       M en   ndau     an           bi       suk   k a d it   kapar.
                I pl unload 3sg       poss   thing from                ship
                We unloaded his things from the ship.
     3.34       Suk n e f o             sane pa        w o g a n g it n d e.
                thing det forbidden so          child small      ear neg
                Those things arc forbidden, so small children must not eat them.
   This prefix is derivational, forming nouns from verbs and adjectives. So, for example,
instead of just saying A n g it s u k ‘They ate things’, one could say A n g it s u g it ‘They ate
food’. Here the prefix su k- combines with the verb g it ‘eat’ to form the noun su g it ‘food’.
   A subclass of verbs including activities such as eat, grow, plant, fight, decorate, dance and
any speaking type of verb such as say, advise, tell stories, sing or chant can be prefixed with
suk-. Adjectives can also be prefixed by suk-. Intransitive motion verbs do not combine with
this prefix. There is only one example in the data of a noun, b o ‘fruit’ combining with su k-.
The phonological rule, that geminates do not occur in Abun, results in the ellipsis of k
preceding velar stops. In addition, the primary stress occurs on the final syllable and so the
prefix, su k-, is unstressed. Some examples are below:
     3.35   mbrau                   to decorate                   suk-mbrau     decoration
            du                      to speak                      suk-du        news/story

            git                     to eat                        su-git        food

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES                                                                33

33.2.2 T he personaliser, ye-
   Similar to suk, the free lexical form ye ‘person’ also undergoes grammaticalisation to
become a personaliser prefix, yet remains elsewhere as an autonomous element. The free
form occurs as an undefined or indefinite third person pronoun in example 3.36. In such
cases it has its own independent stress.
   3.36     Ye       mu mo nden.
            3indef go loc outside
            They (indefinite) went outside.
   This independent stress is lost when the personaliser ye- combines with nouns to form
names for persons in different roles or positions. The prefix is a derivational prefix and the
resultant forms, which are in a different subclass, are frequently not equal to the
compositional meaning of the components. In example 3.37, the one who stands on a tree
stump does so because he is a leader in society. In example 3.38, a man who has not been
trained at one of the shaman training schools (where Abun men are trained to relate to spirit
beings and so become ‘priests’ of their animistic religion) is considered to be not a ‘normal’
man but literally a ‘woman-person’.
   3.37     ye-kwe-su
            PERS-tree-head
            leader (lit. tree-stump person)
   3.38     ye-nggon
            PERS-woman
            male who is not a shaman
   Not all the affixed forms are idiomatic, but aspects of a particular person’s origin or
features are referred to, such as:
   3.39     An ye-nden.
            3sg PERS-inland
            He is a non-coastal (inland) person.
   3.40     An    ye-ka-kwo.
            3sg PERS-body-white
            He is a white person.
   Use of the ye- prefix is also made in the Abun people’s names. Almost all clan names,
which are used like a family name, are formed by the prefixing of ye- to a verb or adjective,
such as ye-njau ‘PERS-bite’, ye-bro ‘PERS-boil’, ye-rin ‘PERS-pour’, ye-nggren ‘PERS-shine’,
and ye-kese ‘PERS-evil’.
3.3.23 Noun compounds
    In addition to the stem modification processes such as those discussed above, a significant
feature of Abun is word compounding. Words are formed by the combination of two or
more members of open lexical classes such as kapar-ok ‘boat-fly: airplane’, kwe-nggwot
‘tree-packaged: book’. The components of these compounds are noun + verb and they form
nouns. This may be expressed as [n- v]n, in the same format Anderson (1985:46) uses.
Other compounds, such as gwem-bo ‘face-fruit: nose’, nu-syo ‘house-mouth: doorway’
consist of noun + noun to form a noun and can be expressed as [n- n]n .
34                                                                                            CHAPTER 3


    The compound status of the examples given here is confirmed by the way the forms have
shifted in meaning, which is more common for words than for phrases (Anderson 1985:43).
So a y e - g w e s - w a i ‘PERS-leg-pass: leg-passing person’ is actually a mediator, a k w e - n g w o t
‘tree-packaged: packaged tree’ is a book and so on. But the main factor determining the
compound status of the forms is the fact that stress in Abun is predictably syllable-final, so
the lack of stress on the initial syllables indicates that in the Abun mind a new word is
derived. Thus in k a p a r -o k the final syllable o k is stressed, while the syllables k a and p a r are
not. If this was a clause, in the unusual event of a boat flying, then p a r of k a p a r would be
stressed and the word o k would have its own independent stress.
   Some noun compounds consist of the personaliser and noun and verb, [n- v]n, or a noun
and adjective [n—Adjlu; for example, y e - g w e s - w a i ‘PERS-leg-pass: mediator’, y e - d a - m o k
‘PERS-skin-raw: foreigner’ and y e -p a -sy e ‘PERS-child-big: important person’.
    Non-human whole-part compounds are combinations of nouns where the second
member is a bound morpheme. All of these may be represented as [n- n]n, since they are
combinations of nouns, and the resultant form is also a noun, for example g u r-b o ‘coconut-
fruit’, su -g o ‘head-hair’, be-ku ‘kangaroo-flesh: kangaroo meat’. In addition, bird names are
compounds. The word nd a m ‘bird’ occurs in isolation, but the second morpheme (bird type)
does not; for example, n d a m -k o k o r ‘bird-fowl: domesticated fowl’, n d a -w a m ‘bird-crow:
crow’, and n d a -so m ‘bird-bat: fruit bat’. All of these types of compounds indicate a
possessor-possessed or whole-part relationship. For example, the generic word for tree is
kw e. But when leaves are referred to, the form is k w e -n a t ‘tree-leaves’. The first morpheme,
kw e, is a free-form morpheme, but the latter morpheme -n u t ‘leaves’ is bound. Leaves are
never referred to as *nat. Likewise branch, bark, roots are formed using k w e together with
the respective bound morpheme, k w e -g u k ‘branch’, k w e -d a ‘bark’ and k w e -n o s ‘roots’. The
‘whole’ in these types of whole-part relationships is not just limited to kw e, but also other
plants such as g u r-n a t ‘coconut leaves’ and b e i-n a t ‘sago palm leaves’. Furthermore, other
living things such as birds, animals, fish and some inanimate objects and their parts are also
compounds, for example, n d a m -g o ‘feathers of bird’, w o -d a r ‘scales of fish’, and y o r -o t
‘spear-tip’. The morpheme representing the part is always bound.


3.3.2.4 Noun compounds and the /- prefix
    After the initial reference to a ‘whole-part’ type noun in a discourse, further reference can
be made to the item by replacing the morpheme representing the whole with the prefix,
Therefore, after an initial reference to k w e n a t , additional reference to that item later in the
discourse is made by using the prefix i- as a pronominal referent, and so the form would be
i-n a t ‘its-leaves’. Likewise with the other types of whole-part relationships, n d a m -g o
becomes i-g o ‘its-feathers’, w o -d a r becomes i-d a r ‘its-scales’ and y o r - o t becomes i- o t ‘its-
tip’. In such words both morphemes are bound.
   In human whole-part relationships or inalienable possession, the prefix i- is not used,
rather the person’s name or person pronoun is used, for example M u sa s y im ‘Musa’s
arm/hand’, j i s y im ‘my arm/hand’, a n g w e s ‘his/her leg’. The possessive pronoun for
human inalienable possession is the same as the subject and object pronoun for each person.
Furthermore, the body part (syim , ‘arm’, g w e s ‘leg’ etc.) may occur as a free form and is not
a bound morpheme, as is the case of the ‘part’ in non-human whole-part relationships.
Therefore, the prefix i- is only used as an inalienable possessive pronoun prefix for non­
MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES                                                                35

human referents, replacing the ‘whole’ in the whole-part relationship in the same way a
pronoun replaces a noun.


3.3.2.5 Relator nouns
    The final noun subclass is relator nouns. These may appear in some cases as the head or
as a modifier in a locative prepositional phrase (see §5.4.2 for examples). Words in this
subclass can be broken into two subsubclasses, those that stand on their own and those that
compound with de ‘side’. There are nine in the former group and six in the latter. These are
listed in the following two tables:

3.3.3 Adjectives
   Adjectives are a class of words denoting qualities or attributes, which in Abun functionally
modify nouns and frequently function as predicates as in example 3.41a. Adjectives are
distinct from verbs in that they function as head of adjectival phrases and, in those phrases,
can specify degree such as comparative and superlative as in example 3.41b, c. Furthermore,
36                                                                                      CHAPTER 3


although structurally both adjectives and verbs directly follow the predicate marker y o , verbs
never directly precede the intensifier w ai, whereas adjectives do.
     3.41 a. Yenggras            ne           n g g i.
             old/respected.man det            strong
             The old man is strong.
            b. Yenggras            ne    nggi    w ai               k a d it   nan.
               old/respected.man   DET   strong INT                 from       2sg
               The old man is stronger than you.
            c.   Yenggras              ne     nggi       w ai       ore.
                 old/respected.man DET strong            INT        complete
                 The old man is the strongest.
   The class of adjectives in Abun hovers on the borderline of being an open or closed word
class. While on the one hand adjectives do occur as predicates and also specify degree, which
are features of an open class of adjectives, many adjectival meanings are expressed through
verbs, which is more typical of a language with a closed adjective class according to
Schachter (1985:16).
     Relativisation of verbs express the equivalent of a modifying adjective. For example:
     3.42        Pa    g a to   ja m    suk          mwa        m a.
                 child REL        know things many come
                 1. The boy who knows many things came.
                 2. The in te llig e n t boy came.
     3.43        An    sok-bot      n u -sy o              g a to       kak      ne.
                 3sg enter-along house-mouth               rel          open      det
                 He entered though the open door.
   Among the adjectives which modify the head of a noun phrase, syntactically only one
class can be distinguished, because only one adjective can modify a noun head in a noun
phrase. The modification of a noun by more than one adjective requires the use of other
constructions which are discussed in §5.2.1.
   In the corpus of data to hand a total of 38 adjectives has been distinguished, but there may
well be others, thus it is included as an open word class. Semantically, distinctions can be
made to form groups of colour, size, quality or age adjectives, but syntactically they all
function in the same way.
    There is one adjective compound formed by two adjectives, [adj- adj]A(Jj, w o k -g a n ‘small-
little: young and small’.


3.3.4 Adverbs
   The class of adverbs, which function as modifiers of constituents other than nouns
(Schachter 1985:20), is a heterogeneous group in Abun consisting of several subclasses,
‘directional’ adverbs, ‘time’ adverbs, ‘manner’ adverbs and ‘degree’ adverbs. Directional and
degree adverb subclasses are closed, and the number of manner adverbs is limited. Time
adverbs have more flexibility with some compounding evident.
MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSES                                                                          37

   The first subclass is d ire c tio n a l a d verb s. These include words such as n im ‘east(erly)’, j u
‘upstream’ and act as adverbs when they occur outside the phrase, that is directly following a
determiner as in examples 3.44b and 3.45b. This same subclass of words (listed as relator
nouns above) may also occur within the phrase to modify the head of a locative prepositional
phrase as seen in 3.44a and 3.45a. This subclass of relator nouns does ‘double duty’, acting
both as modifiers of a phrase and as a closed subclass of directional adverbs, in which case
they occur outside the phrase.
   3.44 a.     m o banbo        s y e nim n e
               loc  mountain big east det
               on the big eastern mountain
          b.   m o banbo       sye ne       nim
               loc  mountain big det east
               on the big mountain in the easterly direction
   3.45 a.     m o N ya rw o n bi      nu   de-ju                     ne
               loc  Nyarwon poss house side-upstream                  det
               on the upstream side of Nyarwon’s house
          b.   m o N ya rw o n   bi      nu      ne    de-ju
               loc  Nyarwon poss house det              side-upstream
               at Nyarwon’s house, upstream side
    The second subclass of adverbs is tim e a d v e rb s, which consists of words such as i k
‘tomorrow’, k a m ekre ‘yesterday’, and compound constructions like k a m - d ik - k a m -d ik ‘day-
one-day-one: everyday’ and ber-gan ‘later-little: shortly’. These adverbs are usually sentence-
initial in their distribution, but may also be part of the predicate. This subclass of adverbs
alone has considerable options in its placement in the sentence. For example:
   3.46 a. K a m - d ik - k a m - d ik an  ma   mo ji             bi         nu.
           day-one-day-one             3sg come LOC lSG            POSS      house
           Everyday he came to my house.
          b. A n k a m - d ik - k a m -d ik m a  mo j i          bi         nu.
             3sg day-one-day-one            come LOC lSG         POSS       house
             Everyday he came to my house.
         c. A n m a    k a m - d ik - k a m -d ik mo j i         bi         nu.
            3sg come day-one-day-one              LOC lSG        POSS       house
            He came everyday to my house.
         d. A n m a    mo ji      bi      nu k a m - d ik - k a m -d ik .
            3sg come loc I sg poss house day-one-day-one
            He came to my house everyday.
   The third subclass of adverbs is m a n n e r a d v e rb s. This subclass is not as ‘open’ as a
regular open class because many adverbial meanings are expressed in other ways, such as
associative prepositional phrases su san g g e ‘with truth: truly’, or the use of adjectives without
any special markings. Schachter (1985:22) mentions this possibility, noting that there are
languages in which the class of adjectives do double duty, modifying verbs as well as nouns.
Abun’s adjectives do that type of double duty; for example, ndo in example 3.47 is a manner
38                                                                                                                           CHAPTER 3


adverb, whereas n d o in example 3.48 is an adjective. Alternatively, one may say that some
adjectives undergo conversion to form a subclass of manner adverbs.
     3.47            An         ben          an         bi           suk     i            ne    ndo.
                     3 sg     do      3 sg poss thing own                                 det   good
                         He does his things well.
     3.48            An       it     sa n    ndo     s e p a tu ndo.
                     3 sg     wear clothes good shoes good
                         He was wearing good clothes and good shoes.
    Manner adverbs consist of a small group of adjectives (about 12) that do double duty as
adjectives and manner adverbs such as n d o ‘good/well’, ib it ‘bad/badly’, nggi
‘strong/strongly’, o t ‘sharp/sharply’. In addition there is another group, that behaves only as
adverbs, including k e k ro ‘quickly’, p a r e ‘slowly’ and a reduplicated form3, n y ip -n y a p
‘finely crushed’. All manner adverbs are distinguished distributionally in that they fall outside
the noun phrase or possessive phrase, directly following the determiner as seen in example
3.47.
   ‘Degree’ adverbs are a small closed subclass of adverbs which modify manner adverbs as
well as adjectives. Distributionally, they always directly follow an adjective or an adverb.
There are two adverbs in this subclass, te k e r ‘very/too’ and w a i ‘more than/passing’ as seen
in examples 3.49 and 3.50 below.
     3.49            An             nuk         ye             teker.
                         3 sg  speak people int
                         She spoke (about) people too much.
     3.50            An             bes      an             wai ore.
                                                        nggw a         kok
                         3 sg   lift 3 s g body      high int complete
                         He lifted up (exalted) himself as the highest.


3.4   C   lo sed w o r d c la sses


   In Abun, there are six basic closed word classes consisting of noun adjuncts, verb
adjuncts, conjunctions, proforms, particles and interjections. Each of these and their
subclasses will be discussed in turn below.
   With regard to closed classes, Schachter (1985:23) makes the comment that there is a
correlation between the prominence of closed classes in a language and the position of the
language on the analytic-synthetic scale. The more analytic the language is, the more
prominent is the role of closed classes. Schachter (1985:24) adds, “...much of the semantic
and syntactic work done by the members of closed word classes in analytic languages is
done instead by a ffix e s in synthetic languages.” Therefore, Abun, being heavily analytic, has
many distinct types of closed classes and very few affixes.

                                  Modal
       Interjections


   The closed classes in Abun are distinguished on the basis of syntax; for example,
pronouns (together with proper nouns) may be directly followed by the possessive linker bi,
predicate markers always directly precede a verb or predicate adjective, prepositions always
precede their noun, and particles, except the topicaliser, are always sentence-final.


3.4.1 Noun adjuncts
   There are several subclasses of noun adjuncts including the possessive linker bi (for more
detailed use of this linker see §5.3); ten prepositions; many quantifiers (including general
quantifiers, cardinal and ordinal numerals); classifiers and determiners (which have three
sub-subclasses and many compounds forms).
   Below is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent. More
details of their use is found in §5.4.

   Q u a n tifie rs may be either general or a specific numeral. The general quantifiers are m w a
‘many’, b o k ‘several’ and d e y o ‘some’. They follow adjectives, when present, in the noun
phrase.
   The Abun n u m e ra l system is a decimal system. This is common in the West Papuan
Phylum, to which Abun belongs, but the languages belonging to the neighbouring Trans-
Papuan Phylum, some of which are in the south of the Bird’s Head Peninsula of Irian Jaya,
have a binary and additive system. Table 3.8 below lists the Abun numerals. Note that so p
means ‘and/in addition’. The same word is also used in a n s y im - s o p - k w a ‘his arm-addition-
thing: his finger’.

    O rdinal n u m e ra ls are formed by a combination of d o and each numeral except for do-
k etke ‘first’, or the dialectal variant, d o -fu tm o ‘first’. Every other ordinal numeral is formed
by the combining of d o with the appropriate cardinal numeral; for example, d o -m u m e k
‘fifth’, d o -m u sy u d ik so p w e ‘twelfth’ and so on.
   When the quantifier is a specific numeral, a c la s s ifie r normally precedes it to indicate
something of the shape and size of the object. There are many types of classifiers that may be
used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase head. In Table 3.9, the common
classifiers are listed with the types of nouns to which they apply.

   There are several subclasses of d e te rm in e rs including what may be called articles that deal
with a specific/unspecific distinction, these are y o ‘a’ and n e ‘the’. A second subclass is the
deictics which consist of re ‘this’, ne ‘that’ and tu ‘that (distant)’. Thirdly, there is a referents
subclass which consists of an anaphoric referent, g a , and an external referent to . Also, the
three deictic particles and the subordinating conjunction to (a different to to the external
referent) form compounds with the referents; as well as the focus or topicaliser particle ana-,
the simile particle sa \ and the general locative preposition m o , as shown in Table 3.10 below:

3.4.2 V erb adjuncts
   There are two subclasses in the closed class of verb adjuncts. First there are certain verbs
that combine with v e r b a l p a r tic le s . These particles, such as m a ‘come’, m u ‘go’ and k e m
‘stay’ do double duty as verbs, but when used as v e r b a l p a r t i c l e s are discontinuous with the
verb and follow the object; see §5.1 for more details. Some of the verbal particles, like w e
‘away’, are not used as any other part of speech. Some verbs with verbal particles are listed
in Table 3.11 below:
MORPHOLOGYAND WORD CLASSES                                                                          43

                      gw at           ma                    bring (carry... come)

                      bare            we                   throw away


A second subclass consists of four p r e d ic a te m a r k e r p a r tic le s which always directly
precede the verb when present. The meanings of the predicate markers range across the entire
spectrum of concepts that are normally referred to as tense, aspect or mood.6 See §10 for
more details. They are contained in Table 3.12 below:

                                     TABLE3.12: PREDICATEMARKERS

3.4.3 Conjunctions
     There are many conjunctions in Abun. The conjunctions which coordinate clauses are
more closely associated with the first conjunct in the sentence, since a pause occurs after the
conjunction. Schachter (1985:47) says that this type of conjunction “can be characterised as
p o s tp o s itio n a l since they form structural conjuncts with the conjuncts they follow”. This is
surprising since it is expected that they would follow Abun’s general word-order
characteristic, that is prepositional.
   Table 3.13 below lists both the coordinating and subordinating conjunctions found in
Abun. Many of the conjunctions are formed by compounding, and the benefactive
preposition w a does double duty as a subordinating conjunction. For more detailed
discussion about Abun conjunctions see §11 and §12.


6    Lyons (1968:317) noted that in some languages these concepts may merge into one another. In
     attempting to define the precise meaning o f the predicate markers they can be loosely described as
     falling into this broad area.

3.4.4 Proforms
   Abun has three subclasses of proforms                  including pronouns, prosentences, and
interrogative proforms.
    There is only one set of p ro n o u n s in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3.14 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus m e -k a -g ri ‘we three’ or a n -k a -a t ‘they four’ are
frequently used in story telling.

                   non-human         i-



   In addition to the above pronouns, Abun has a reciprocal pronoun, y u , and two reflexive
forms, d a k a i and w a d ig a n . These modify the appropriate pronoun above and y u . For further
details regarding the distinction between these two see §5.2.1. The same form of this
pronoun is used for all persons.
   The Abun p r o s e n te n c e s u b c la s s consists of one member, which is also the primary
negation particle, n d e . This word is used to answer questions with a ‘no’ and, as such, is
equivalent to a negative sentence. Affirmative answers use an echo system rather than a
prosentence (see §6.1 for more details).
   There are three members of the in te r r o g a tiv e p r o f o r m s s u b c la s s , namely u ‘which’,
su m a  ‘what’ and o t ‘how many’. These forms combine with other words to create
interrogative expressions such as, m o u ‘loc which: where’ and k a m o t ‘day how.many:
when’. For more details see §6.1.4.


3.4.5 Particles
  There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where it could be described as ‘bound’.
   The topicaliser or focus particle is a n a (to ) , which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
    There is one negative particle, n d e , which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker y o form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent ‘predicate’. Used in a sentence without
yo , n d e makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.

   If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.

     The three aspect particles are listed in Table 3.15 below. For more details see §7.1.
                                      TABLE3.15: ASPECTPARTICLES

                          to               incompletive           yet, still


   There is a limited number of particles which some writers refer to as ‘m odality’ rather
than as aspect (Foley 1986:152ff.). In Abun, three modal particles are used. These are listed
in Table 3.16 below and are discussed in more detail in §7.2.

                                       TABLE3.16: MODALPARTICLES

            go                 assertive                  should, could really, certainly


   In Abun, the constituent termed mood is an element of the clause expressed through the
means of a clause-final particle. The indicative mood is unmarked. One interesting feature of
the mood particles is the use of two particles as a linked pair to indicate interrogation. In a
similar way, negation of indicative sentences uses a linked pair of particles. In Abun, the
strategy of using two particles (as opposed to one) is for the purpose of delineating
constituent boundaries. Thus the constituent ‘interrogative’ is marked by two particles, one
termed the initial question marker (iqm), occurring clause-initially and the other, the final
question marker (fqm), which ends or closes the interrogative. In modern usage the initial
question marker te appears to be optional, perhaps influenced by the national language,
Indonesian, which does not possess such a particle. The fqm differs according to the type of
interrogative.
   A table of the eight mood particles is listed below. For further information about mood
particles listed here see §6.

3.4.6 Interjections
   There are several interjections in Abun, such as mban! ‘expression of surprise/alarm’ (for
example, when a coconut falls nearby); mara! ‘expression of disgust’ (for example, when
someone doubts the integrity of another person, this interjection would begin a defence); and
bei! ‘expression of surprise’. According to Schachter (1985:58), “The class of interjections
often includes words which are phonologically distinctive”. However, in contrast to this,
those interjections observed so far fit within the regular phonological patterns of the language.

                                   CLAUSE STRUCTURE



   The focus of this chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly, some comments
are made about the core grammar and grammatical relations (§4.1) followed by a note on
how the grammatical relations hierarchy relates to Abun (§4.2). A discussion of clause types
(§4.3), peripheral constituents, which are labelled here adjuncts (§4.4), and clause-final
particles (§4.5) completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In §4.6, Abun verbless
clauses are discussed.
   A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core, but also in
the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are several syntactic information­
packaging options in Abun clauses such as de-focusing, topicalisation and cleft-like
constructions, which are discussed in §4.7.


4.1 Coregrammar andgrammatical relations
   The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.

   Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews (1985:104) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primarily marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross-
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
   The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
   According to Andrews (1985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and O, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and O is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and O functions.
   On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas O follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a

CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                             49

subject (S) precedes the verb, as in example 4.1. The same is true for a transitive clause, the
subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) follows, as in 4.2.
   4.1        M en    kas.
              lPL     run
              SUBJECT VERB
              We ran.
   4.2        M en      gwa     Isak.
              lPL       hit     Isak
              SUBJECT VERB      OBJECT
              We hit Isak.
   Morphologically the constituents of noun phrases are the same, irrespective of the
grammatical role filled by the noun phrases. In example 4.2 the subject of the transitive
clause (A) is first person plural, while an identical form is also the object (O) of 4.3 and
subject of the intransitive clause (S) in 4.1. All Abun pronouns are invariant in form, whether
they refer to the subject, object or possessor. See Table 3.14 in §3.4.4 for a full list of
pronouns.
   4.3        Isak      gwa     men.
              Isak       hit    lPL
              SUBJECT VERB      OBJECT
              Isak hit us.
   Most other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the use of
prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order is still fairly rigid. For
example, dative, where present, follows an object and precedes other prepositional phrases.
Locative phrases with the preposition mo usually follow all other prepositional phrases.
   Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the
otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that they cannot occur
preceding the direct object (see §4.4.1).
   Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:
         (adjuncts) subject verb (direct object) (indirect object) (adjuncts) (particles)
   Adjuncts include free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various prepositional phrases
expressing associative, instrumental, benefactive and the like. The subject is obligatory and is
rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses. Particles may optionally occur clause-fmally to
indicate polarity, aspect, modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the
subject of the chapters 6 ,7 and 8 of this work.
   Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adjuncts expressing location or time may also be
fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see §4.7 below). Those
expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those expressing location are only
fronted on rare occasions.

4.2 ABUNANDTHEGRAMMATICALRELATIONSHIERARCHY
   Blake (1990:1) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
   In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3.18 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.

                          TABLE3.18: GRAMMATICALRELATIONSHIERARCHY

        Relation                                      Indication
     Subject            precedes verb
     Object             follows verb, and intransitive verbs require class changing suffix,
                        -wa
     Indirect Object    follows object, and takes indirect object preposition is/nai
     Adjunct            occurs clause-fmally following object or indirect object, and takes
                        appropriate preposition to indicate locative, benefactive,
                        instrument etc.


4.3 C lause types
   The number of arguments associated with each verb differs. Three types exist in Abun:
intransitive, requiring one argument (§4.3.1), transitive, requiring two arguments (§4.3.2)
and ditransitive, requiring three arguments (§4.3.3). In Abun, no verbs have specific valency
markings except for the use of the -wa suffix, which forms transitive verbs out of intransitive
verbs (see §3.3.1).


4.3.1 Intransitive clauses
   The verbs in intransitive clauses may be simple verbs of motion such as kas ‘run’, mu
‘go’, ma ‘come’, titi ‘flee’, ok ‘fly’, e ‘fall over’, ges ‘fall down’, sun ‘get up’; verbs of
body functions such as semda ‘dream’, ro ‘urinate’, ku ‘cough’; or verbs relating to a state
such as sem ‘be asleep’, kwop ‘be dead’, nyu ‘be afraid’, i ‘be sick’, i ‘be happy’ det ‘be
broken’, kam ‘be hot’.
   The basic structure of an intransitive clause is subject + verb. The verbs are in most cases
uninflected, except for those inflections discussed in §3.3.1. The subject is obligatory since
no cross-referencing on the verb indicates who or what the subject was. The closest related
language, Maibrat, does have a subject person prefix on the verb, but Abun does not,
CIA USE STRUCTURE                                                                           51

necessitating the continual use of the subject. So, for example, in example 4.4 Isak is
obligatory.
   4.4       Isak     ma.
             Isak     came
             SUBJECT VERB
             Isak came.
   Likewise the verb is obligatory. Any verb in isolation is ungrammatical. An intransitive
clause may consist of several verbs together as in example 4.5. Serial verbs like this function
as a unit.
   4.5       An       kas    m u sem mo nden.
             3sg      run     go sleep loc bush
             SUBJECT VERB                  LOCATIVEPHRASE
             He ran and slept in the bush.
   Intransitive clauses may also contain prepositional phrases. These phrases usually follow
the verb as in example 4.5, and will be discussed in greater detail below, regarding position
and types in §4.4.2 and §5.3 respectively.


4.3.2 Transitive clauses
   Transitive clauses contain verbs such as sap ‘cut’, git ‘eat’, gwa ‘hit’ and nai ‘get’. The
basic structure is subject + verb + object. Example 4.6 illustrates a transitive clause:
   4.6       M en      git      boge-ku.
             I pl       eat     fish-flesh
             subject   verb     object
             We ate fish.
   The subject, as for intransitive clauses, is obligatory. The object is also notionally
obligatory, however object ellipsis frequently occurs in discourse. In example 4.7 there are
two transitive clauses, the first containing sugit ‘food’ as the object. However, in the second
clause the object is elided. It could be phrased an git sugit or, including the object, and the
statement would still be acceptable grammatically. In all cases where the object is elided it is
recoverable from the context.
   4.7       An        git      su-git.      An      git or.
             3sg       eat      NOM-eat 3sg          eat completely
             subject VERB       OBJECT       SUBJECT VERB
             He ate the food.   He ate (it) all.
   Transitive clauses may also include serial verbs, depending upon speaker preference.
Some speakers may use a pronoun to separate verbs such as in example 4.8, while others
may run several verbs together, such as in Ji mu git ‘I went and ate’. Three verbs have been
observed together in the data, as seen in 4.9. Conceivably more than three could be acceptable
given suitable semantic connections. In serial verb constructions like this, intransitive verbs
precede transitive verbs. Where transitive verbs precede intransitive verbs an object
intervenes.

     4.8     Ji       mu       ji         gM        su-git    mo nu.
             I sg     go        lSG       eat       NOM-eat   LOC house
             SUBJECT VERB SUBJECT         VERB      OBJECT    LOCPHRASE
             I went and ate at home.
     4.9     Ye-suk-mise     ma     nai     gwat an        mu      ket.
             PERS-NOM-evil   come capture carry 3sg        go      west
             SUBJECT         VERB                  OBJECT VBPCL ADVERB
             The police came and caught him and took him westward.


4.3.3 DlTRANSITIVECLAUSES
   Ditransitive clauses include verbs that require three arguments such as syo ‘give’, kadum
‘show’ and bi ‘send’. They are constructed in a similar way to transitive clauses but also
include an obligatory dative prepositional phrase as the third argument. A ditransitive clause
consists of:
                                    SUBJECT+ VERB+ OBJECT+ DATIVE
   The dative argument here is obligatory. It is filled by a prepositional phrase that begins
with the preposition is (Abun Ji) or nai, dialectal variant (Abun Ye/Tat), and it usually
precedes other types of prepositional phrases, as seen in examples 4.10 and 4.11.
     4.10    M en    kadum men          bi      tiket is ye-suk-mise.
             I pl    show     I pl      poss    ticket to PERS-NOM-evil
             SUBJECT VERB     OBJECT                   DATIVE
             We showed our tickets to the police.
     4.11    Nggon ne syo            suk-ne     nai    an    bi          im       mo nu.
             girl      DEM give nom-det to             3sg poss          mother LOC house
             SUBJECT         VERB OBJECT        DATIVE                   LOCATIVE
             That girl gave those things to her mother at home.
   Frequently the object is omitted where it is understood from the context. In example 4.12
the object, ‘three plates’, is elided from the second clause. This is possible because it is
recoverable from the context that three plates were given to Isak. In the same way the indirect
object itself, when recoverable from the context, can be elided, except for the preposition. In
example 4.13 it is clear that the third person singular referred to in the first clause is the
recipient of the ginger.
     4.12   An         nai     brek gri,         an         syo      is    Isak.
            3sg        get     plate three       3sg        give     to    Isak
            SUBJECT    VERB OBJECT               SUBJECT VERB        DATIVE
            He took   three plates (of food),   he gave (them) to   Isak.
     4.13    Ji    si    an ma,       ji          bi     ri       nai.
             Iso with 3sg come I sg              give    ginger to
             SUBJECT           VERB SUBJECT VERB OBJECT DATIVE
             He and I came (to the house), and I gave the ginger to (him).

4.4 A djuncts
   Adjuncts express spatio-temporal settings of events and other secondary participants and
information not contained in the core arguments. Adjuncts are distinguished from the core
arguments by syntactic positioning outside of the core and by marking with prepositions.
Adjuncts of a clause are therefore typically filled by adverbial phrases (see §4.4.1) and
prepositional phrases (see §4.4.2).


4.4.1 Adverbial phrases
   Adverbial phrases consist of an adverb and an optional intensifier. In most cases such
phrases are realised by an adverb alone.
   There are several types of adverbs discussed in §3.3.4 such as time adverbs, manner
adverbs, directional adverbs and degree adverbs. Degree adverbs are used in forming
adverbial and adjectival phrases and will be discussed later in §5.5. The other three types
occur as free forms or as the head of an adverbial phrase. There is some flexibility in their
placement in the Abun sentence, but as a general rule time adverbs are sentence-initial while
manner and directional adverbs generally follow the object and precede prepositional phrases.
   The most flexible as to their placement in an Abun sentence are time adverbs. An example
below repeated from §3.3.4 (examples 3.46a, b, c, d) illustrates this. Usually time adverbs
are sentence-initial, but to change the focus and semantic scope of the predicate they may
follow the verb. This is particularly significant in negative indicative sentences which are
discussed in §8.5. Also time adverbs can occur between a subject and verb on rare occasions,
as in example 4.14b, breaking the normal pattern of Abun main clauses.
  4.14 a.    Kam-dik-kam-dik an         ma   mo j i    bi               nu.
            day-one-day-one    3sg      come LOC lSG POSS               house
            ADVERB             SUBJECT VERB LOCATIVEPHRASE
            Everyday he came to my house.
         b. A n     kam-dik-kam-dik ma            mo    ji    bi      nu.
            3sg     day-one-day-one    come       loc   I sg poss     house
            SUBJECT ADVERB              VERB       LOCATIVEPHRASE
            Everyday he came to my house.
         c. An      ma     kam-dik-kam-dik mo j i     bi                nu.
            3sg     come day-one-day-one LOC iSG poss                   house
            SUBJECT VERB    ADVERB          LOCATIVEPHRASE
            He came everyday to my house.
         d. An         ma    mo j i     bi       nu    kam-dik-kam-dik.
            3sg       come loc I sg poss         house day-one-day-one
            SUBJECT   VERB LOCATIVEPHRASE              ADVERB
            He came   to my house everyday.
   In Abun adverbs of manner there is some flexibility, but they generally follow the object,
where present. Therefore in intransitive clauses these adverbs directly follow the verb, as in
example 4.15a, or another adjunct, 4.15b; but they are unacceptable preverbally, 4.15c, or
following any polarity, aspect, modality or mood particle.

               She has been sleeping quietly in the room.
   Usually an adverb indicating the manner of the action not only follows the object but also
precedes the dative, as seen in example 4.16a. It may also follow any adjunct including the
dative as in 4.16b, but it may not occur in any position ahead of the object, as in 4.16c to
4.16e.

               ADVERB    SUBJECT VERB OBJECT            DATIVE
               Quickly he gave food to me.
   Adverbs indicating direction also occur in the same position, that is, following the object
and preceding any prepositional phrase, as in example 4.17. These adverbs are free-form
relator nouns (see §3.3.2) such as ti ‘sea, north’, b u r ‘earth, down’, n im ‘above, east’, k e t
‘west’, and n d eu ‘interior, south’.

4.4.2 Prepositional phrases
   Prepositional phrases consist of dative, spacio-temporal, benefactive, manner, associative,
and instrumental phrases. Prepositional phrases follow an object. When there is a dative
prepositional phrase, it usually precedes other prepositional phrases. The order amongst the
other types of phrases is somewhat fluid.
   The following examples illustrate the position of various types of phrases in the clause.
For more details regarding the types of prepositional phrases see §5.4. Several types of
phrases begin with a preposition su ‘with’; for example, temporal phrases as in example
4.18, associative phrases 4.19, instrumental phrases 4.20 and 4.21 and manner phrases 4.22.
  4.18      An      kem       mo     kampung       re  su    tahun musyu m ufit

             He truly entered into God’s family.
   Benefactive phrases begin with the preposition wa ‘for’, as in example 4.23. Locative
phrases generally begin with the locative preposition mo ‘at, in, on’ in 4.18, or can also begin
with ket ‘along’, 4.24, bot ‘about’, 4.25, or kadit ‘from’ as in 4.26. The preposition kadit is
also used to form temporal phrases, as in 4.27.

            She shouted (for me) about the houses, about the outside of the houses just up
            to the east (of the village).
     4.26   M en    mu    kadit Dom mu               mo     Uigwem.
            lPL     go    from Dom go                to     Uigwem

            SUBJECT VERB         1EMP0RAL
            I have done (that)   all the time up until now.
   The position of prepositional phrases relative to each other is somewhat fluid as is
normally the case for adjuncts. However, in the corpus of data it is clear that there is a
preference for su (associative and instrumental) phrases to precede mo locative phrases.
   Of the adjuncts, temporal phrases more commonly precede the subject as in example
4.28, and they may be placed just like time adverbs illustrated in 4.14 above.
     4.28   Su fu tm o ye           mu nai       su-git    mo nggwe.
            with first     3indef go      get    NOM-eat loc garden
            At first people went to get food from the garden.
   Prepositional phrases can occur in series as in the case of locative phrases with the
prepositions bot, as in example 4.25 above, and mo 4.29.
     4.29   Yen      taru            mu mo nje           mo nden mo Syubun.
            3indef send.message go l o c 3indef l o c bush l o c Syubun
            SUBJECT VERB                  LOCATIVE       LOCATIVE    LOCATIVE
            They sent a message to the people in the bush at Syubun.


4.5 Particles
   The role of particles in Abun clauses is significant. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this work are
devoted to a discussion thereof. To complete the general picture of Abun main clauses, here
is a brief summary of the role of particles used to convey notions of negation, aspect,
modality and mood. They all occur clause-final in the following order:
                          (negation) (aspect) (modality) (mood)
CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                              57

   Each particle is optional. They may co-occur where semantically feasible. Furthermore,
the particle expressing negation may co-occur with another particle, yo, which is preverbal,
forming a linked pair, as discussed in §8.2. Likewise the particle expressing interrogative
mood may co-occur with a sentence-initial particle, te, forming a linked pair, as discussed in
§   6 . 1.


4.5.1 N egation
    Givon (1984:336) comments that NEG-markers tend to attach themselves as morphemic
operators almost always to the verb. However Abun differs markedly from the norm in that
its main NEG-marker, nde, is not attached to the verb, and is frequently distant from the verb,
being one of the clause-final particles. For prohibitive sentences nde is used as in examples
4.30 and 4.31; but for negative indicatives the predicate (v, o and all adjuncts) is bracketed by
two particles, yo and nde, as seen in 4.32 and 4.33. For a more detailed discussion of
negation see §8.1.
      4.30   Nggon  git su-ge         ga sye           nde.
             women eat NOM-body rel big                neg
             Women must not eat big animals.
      4.31   Nan mu       nde.
             2 sg go      neg
             Don’t go!
      4.32   An       yo         gwat kwem nde.
             3sg      NEG        bring canoe NEG
             SUBJECT NEG         VERB OBJECT NEG
             He did not bring    the canoe.
      4.33   Ji        yo     syo    mbre            is Musa mo nu      nde.
             lSG        NEG give antique.cloth to Musa LOG house NEG
             SUBJECT NEG VERB OBJECT                 DATIVE    LOCATIVE NEG
             I didn’t give antique cloth to Musa at the house.


4.5.2 A spect
   The verb in Abun is uninflected for either tense, mood or aspect. Aspect particles add
increments to the meaning of the verb and occur clause-finally. In Abun, aspect particles,
which are optional, refer to the distribution of time or contour of an action or state of affairs.
They are:
                                   re     PERFECT
                                   it     COMPLETIVE
                                to     INCOMPLETIVE
   Examples of each type are given in examples 4.34 to 4.36. For further details about aspect
in Abun see §7.1.
58                                                                               CHAPTER 4


     4.34   An    we        mu    re.
            3pl two         go    PERF
            SUBJECT         VERB ASPECT
            They (two)     had gone.
     4.35   Nggon    we        sap     yu         it.
            women    two       slash each.other cam
            SUBJECT            VERB OBJECT        ASPECT
            The two women      had already slashed each other.
     4.36   An         ben    suk       mo     nggwe      to.
            3sg        do     thing     LOC garden        INCAM
            subject VERB OBJECT LOCATIVE                  ASPECT
            He is still working in the garden.
  Aspect particles follow both prepositional phrases and the final negative particle, nde,
where present. It is uncommon for two aspect particles to occur together, but it is possible
where the clause is both negative and perfect, as in example 4.37.
     4.37   Ji      yo     jam       kom mo        m it      nde to re.
            I sg NE)G know up.to loc               inside NEG incam perf
            I still have not yet understood the whole thing.


4.5.3 M odality
   Modal markers optionally occur where the attitude of the speaker is marked grammatically
near the end of a clause, following negation or aspect particles and just preceding any mood
marking. Modals in Abun are:
                      ya              possibility (example   4.38)
                      bayok           probability   (example 4.39)
                      go              assertive (example 4.40)
   They are all clause-final and, where semantically possible, may occur with negation,
aspect and mood particles. For more details see §7.2. Examples are:
     4.38   Prisila ma       sap Barbarina o            ya.
            Prisila    come cut Barbarina again         pmm
            SUBJECT VERB          OBJECT      ADVERB MODAL
            Prisila might come and cut Barbarina again.
     4.39   An        jam    it         bayok.
            3sg        know cam        prob
            subject    verb aspect     modal
            He probably already knows.
     4.40   Ye      ga sa-ne          be      ben siri       su      an  ne go
            person rel like-that later        do wrong with 3sg DET ASS

            A person like that will really commit adultery with her.

               He really made   things very very difficult, didn’t he?


4.5.4 M ood
   According to Lyons (1968:307) the term mood “is best defined in relation to an
‘unmarked’ class of sentences which express simple statements of fact, unqualified with
respect to the attitude of the speaker towards what he is saying”.
   In Abun the indicative mood is unmarked while the other two basic types of mood are
marked by the use of particles which occur clause-final. In addition Abun also marks another
mood, that of frustrated action. A list of all Abun mood particles is given in Table 3.16 in
§3.4.5.
   Interrogative mood, in addition to the question word itself, has two particles that bracket
the clause, te ‘initial question marker’, for all types of questions and a final question marker
which is one of:
          ne               INFORMATION FINAL QUESTION MARKER (example 4.42)
          e               yes/no final question marker        (example 4.43)
          bado            alternative question marker         (example 4.44)
          fe               confirmative question marker        (example 4.45)
  The initial question marker is optional; however, the final question marker is obligatory.
More details of interrogative structure types are found in Chapter 6.
   4.42        (Te)   nan       jan      suma mo nggwe ne?

               MOOD SUBJECT VERB OBJECT            MOOD
               Do you know God’s family name or not?

               I have lived a long time here, haven’t I?
   The initial question marker, te, is used to alert the hearer that a question is about to be
asked. It is more commonly used within a complex sentence, as in example 4.46, than in
60                                                                                          CHAPTER 4


simple sentences. In a sample of 194 questions in the corpus of data, te occurred 41 times,
that is about 21% of questions used te.
     4.46       Nggwe       ga    nan     kem    sure     te    nu    but         bado,

                In the garden where you are living, have you cleared it (and worked it), or have
                pigs eaten the plants in the garden?
   For imperative, the following particles are clause-final: se (Abun Ji) and the dialectal
variant, tom (Abun Tat) strong hortative as in example 4.47; et mild hortative 4.48, and nde
‘prohibitive’ 4.49. The unmarked form, ‘basic imperative’ 4.50, is distinguished from
indicative mood by context. For further discussion regarding imperative mood see §6.2.
     4.47        Nggon mise, men gat           yu            o            se!

                 Bring your things   here quickly!
   Frustrated action mood uses the particle ware, as in example 4.51. The nearest English
equivalent would be ‘in vain’, ‘to no avail’ or ‘but without success’. Its meaning is that an
action was attempted but the goal of the action was not achieved. It is clause-final like other
moods following modal markers. See §6.3 for more details.
     4.51        Yen      syuret    an       mo-ne      ware.
                 3indef look.for 3sc.       LOC-there FRUS
                 SUBJECT VERB       OBJECT LOCATIVE MOOD
                 They looked for him there without success.


4.6 Verbless clauses
   In Abun there are a small number of verbless clauses. Three of them are simply
juxtaposed, while a fourth uses the complement particle, do, to attribute a proper name. The
four types are:
     •      Equational clauses:      attribute a nominal to the subject (example 4.52).
CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                            61

   •      Name clauses:           attribute a proper name to the subject (example 4.53).
   •      Descriptive clauses:    attribute an adjective to the subject (example 4.54).
   •      Locational clauses:     attribute a location to the subject (example 4.55).
   4.52        An ye-nden.
               3sg PERS-jungle/bush/interior
               He (is a) Yenden (lit. bush.person).
   4.53        Pa    gum do Ojhi.
               child name com Ofni
               The child’s name is Ofni.
   4.54        Ofni bi     nu       sye.
               Ofni poss house big
               Ofni’s house is big.
   4.55        An mo nu.
               3sg loc house
               He (is) at (the) house.
   The first two types are negated by the use of nde only (see §8.1.3), while the latter two
require the use of a linked pair of negative particles, yo...nde, as discussed in §8.2.3 and
§8.2.4.
   Name clauses require the use of the complement particle. The same particle is also used to
introduce direct and indirect speech. For a full discussion regarding these complements in
Abun, see Chapter 10.


4.7 Syntactic information-packaging options in Abun clauses
   According to Foley and Van Valin (1985:299) there is a wide variety of syntactic
information-packaging options used in languages. They discuss the options of passive, dative
shift, left-dislocation, topicalisation, and cleft constructions.
   Of those defined by Foley and Van Valin, passive, dative shift, left-dislocation and cleft
constructions do not occur in Abun. However, de-focusing constructions which achieve the
same purpose as passive (§4.7.1), topicalisation (§4.7.2), and cleft-like constructions (§4.7.3)
do occur in Abun.


4.7.1 D e-focusing
   According to Foley and Van Valin (1985:299) passives characteristically present the
undergoer argument as the subject. They also say that, traditionally, the subject has been
described as the constituent which specifies what the sentence is about, meaning that passive
sentences are understood to be about the undergoer argument.
   In Abun there is no passive construction as such. However, to make the undergoer
argument the item which the sentence is about, different means are used. The indefinite
pronoun ye becomes subject of the sentence. This has the effect of backgrounding the
subject, and so transfers attention to the undergoer argument. So instead of saying, ‘The bag
62                                                                                  CHAPTER 4


was taken to the bush’, the Abun people say, ‘Someone took the bag to the bush’ as in the
following example:
     4.56   Ye      gwat yu       ne    mu      mo    nden.
            3indef take bag the go              loc   bush
            The bag was taken to the bush.
   The sentence here is about the bag, not about the indefinite subject, ‘someone’. The use of
an indefinite pronoun in this way therefore results in a semantic force similar to an agentless
passive. Compare Foley and Van Valin’s (1985:334) statement that ‘There are many
languages that lack all of the constructions... [of both backgrounding and foregrounding
passives]. Nevertheless, they do have means of expressing that a non-actor is more important
than the actor”. See example 4.56 above.


4.7.2 T opicalisation
   Foley and Van Valin (1985:355) define topicalisation as a procedure used to place an np,
other than a subject, sentence-initially. In contrast to passive structures which are clause-
internal, Foley and Van Valin consider topicalisation as clause-external. They say,
‘Topicalisation...involve(s) the occurrence of an external topic np followed by a sentence
which relates to it in some way”.
   In Abun, simple prepositioning is used to foreground objects and mo locative phrases
with no pronoun trace left in the sentence. The foregrounded item becomes the topic upon
which a comment follows. For example:
     4.57    Yu    ne     ye      gwat mu mo nden.
             bag ana 3indef take          go to       bush
             1. The bag, someone took (it) to the bush.
             2. The bag was taken to the bush.
     4.58    Mo nden ne men git             boge.
             loc bush     ana I pl eat      fish
             In the bush we ate fish.
   Foley and Van Valin (1985:356) claim that “...the primary functions of these [topicalised]
constructions are to introduce new referents into a discourse, or to reintroduce a referent
which was previously introduced but which has not been mentioned in the immediately
preceding discourse”.
    The function of topicalisation in Abun is the second of those mentioned above, namely to
reintroduce a previously introduced referent. However, the referent may have been mentioned
in the immediately preceding sentence, such as in example 4.59.
     4.59    An     mu    me    su-git    yak  mo       nden.
             3SG    go    see   NOM-eat   jump loc      outside
             Su-git     jon      ne    men grem hop mo dapur.
             NOM-eat cooked ana I pl           put     aside LOC kitchen
             He went quickly outside to see the food. The cooked food, we had put aside in
             the kitchen.
CLAUSE STRUCTURE                                                                              63

   In Abun, topicalisation does not occur in isolation. The object or location must have been
mentioned in previous discussion. For this reason, in all cases of topicalisation in Abun, the
determiner, or more specifically the anaphoric referent ne, is obligatory. In example 4.59
‘food’ was already mentioned in the sentence previous to the one where it is topicalised.
   Foley and Van Valin (1985:301) also make the point that in most languages passive is
restricted to core constituents while topicalisation is not. In Abun, de-focusing constructions
are limited to the core, whereas topicalisation is also possible with peripheral constituents, but
only with mo locative phrases, as seen in example 4.60. Topicalisation of other phrase types
such as benefactive (4.61) or instrumental (4.62) is unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
   4.60        Mo     kam pung mit          ne    an gu     ye or                   re.
               LOC    village      inside Am 3sg kill 3indef completely             perf
               Inside that village she had killed everyone.
   4.61        *Wa Wonja Marta kon           su-git.
               ben  Wonja Marta cook NOM-eat
               For Wonja, Marta cooked food.
   4.62        *Su m bam an gp ndar                 ne    kwop.
               with axe       3sg kill dog          det    die
               With an axe he killed the dog.
   Regarding the frequency of topicalisation in Abun, in a sample of five different stories by
five different speakers, seven examples of topicalisation were found, four of object fronting,
and three of mo locative phrase fronting. This represented about 1.5% of the clauses
examined. Thus topicalisation, although possible, is uncommon in Abun.


4.7.3 Cleft-like constructions
  According to Huddleston (1984:459) the general effect of a cleft construction is to give
added prominence to a particular constituent, which he calls the highlighted element.
   The Abun equivalent of what translates into English as a cleft is not syntactically a cleft
construction. In other words, there is no subordinate clause or division into two clauses that
causes prominence of a particular constituent. Instead, a particle anato serves to highlight the
constituent immediately preceding it and intensifies any focus or topics already structured.
For example, compare unmarked example 4.63a with the cleft-like construction in 4.63b:
  4.63 a.      Ron bi     wa men.
               Ron pay for I pl
               Ron paid for us.
          b.   Ron ana-to       bi   wa men.
               Ron foc-nmp pay for I pl
               1. It was Ron who paid for us.
               2. Ron is the one who paid for us.
   Anato is a compound of ana ‘focus’ and to ‘noun modifying particle’. To usually
indicates that embedding will follow. Such embedding refers to and modifies the noun
preceding. In other words, to introduces more information about the preceding noun. So we
64                                                                               CHAPTER 4


know that any noun followed by to is going to have some modification. In this case the
additional information conveyed by adding to to the noun is that of prominence, highlighting
or additional focus.

                                  PHRASE STRUCTURE



   The structure of phrases in Abun is consistent with what has already been stated about its
syntax; namely that fixed word order and particles, rather than affixation, are used to signify
meaning.
   This chapter consists of a survey of phrase types, namely verb phrases (§5.1), noun
phrases (§5.2), possessive phrases (§5.3), prepositional phrases (§5.4), adverbial and
adjectival phrases (§5.5), quantifier phrases (§5.6) and complex phrases (§5.7). The head of
each phrase type is indicated by word order, and word order alone. Table 5.1 below
summarises the structure of each of these phrase types.

5.1 Verb phrases
   For the purposes of this discussion we shall define a verb phrase not as a total predicate,
but limited to the verb and its modifiers, as discussed by Schachter (1985:41). In Abun, verb
phrases are defined as consisting of a verb as head, with optional predicate markers and
verbal particles.
   Auxiliaries, which carry notions of tense, aspect, mood, modality, polarity and voice, are
not considered as part of the Abun verb phrase since they are separated from the verb, not
only by any object, but also by any adverbs and adjuncts in the sentence. Aspect, mood,
polarity and modality particles can be contiguous with the verb only when there are no
object(s), adverbs or adjuncts. Therefore, for Abun, such particles are not analysed here as
part of the verb phrase, but are considered separately because they operate on the clause level.
They are discussed separately in §6, §7, and §8.
                                              65
66                                                                                                  CHAPTER 5


     Thus an Abun verb phrase consists of:
                          (predicate     marker) verb* ( verbal particle)

               (*a direct object, where present, occurs between its verb and the verbal particle)

    One of the two modifying components is a predicate marker particle. There are four
predicate marker particles which when present always directly precede the verb. They are
listed in Table 5.2 below:

                                       table5.2: predicate markers

               Particle                                 Meaning
               yo              did not happen
                waii           happened exactly as before (same verb and object)
                da             did actually happen
                do             is in the process of happening together with...


   The first of these particles, yo, is the first particle of a linked pair of particles, where the
second particle is r id e ‘negative’. Y o occurs only in negative indicative sentences as in
example 5.1. For further discussion of this predicate marker and its role in delineating the
scope of negation see §8.5.
     5.1      An yo     ma     mo nu          nde.
              3pl neg come loc house neg
              They did not come to the house.
   The second of the predicate markers, waii, indicates that the action is the same type of
action as the previous one. The object is also the same type of object, as seen in the sentences
below:
     5.2      M en mu        nai sugit          ete Apner ki   nai            lsa k do
              I pl go        get food          then Apner said to             Isak COM
              “Nan waii mu nai sugit”.
              2sg    also go      get food
              We went to get food, then Apner said to Isak, “You also go and get some
              food”.
     5.3      An we sam nyim mo                    nu ete men waii sam            wari.
              3sg two carry ahead loc house then I pl also carry                  behind
              They (two) carried (things) ahead of us to the house and we also carried
              (things) after them.
  The third and fourth predicate markers are used in complex sentences only. Below is one
example of each.
     5.4      Yunus da          sok-wa Isak sare...
              Yunus actually look-TRS Isak but
              Yunus actually looked at Isak but... (he didn’t do anything)
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                            67

   5.5        M en do   is           mone sa              men yo ku auto nde.
              I pl pred came.down there then-REAL I pl NEG find car neg
              And when we landed there we did not find a car.
   The other modifying component of Abun verb phrases is verbal particles. These particles
are attached to certain verbs like ‘up’ in the English, ‘He looked up the words’, which may,
in English, also be in the form, ‘He looked the words up’. This type of verbal particle is
referred to by Schachter (1985:45) who comments that they frequently have a directional or
locative notion. Abun has similar forms as seen in the following examples:
   5.6 a.     An gwat buku ma            mo nu.
              3sg carry book come loc house
              He brought the book to the house.
         b.   An gwat buku m u mo nu.
              3sg carry book go LOC house
              He took the book to the house.
   5.7        Pa    bare jam sem     ne we         mo nden.
              child throw cassava det away loc outside
              The child threw away the cassava outside.
   5.8        An grem buku ne          kwop mo nu    mit.
              3sg put     book det down loc house inside
              He put the book down inside.
    In English the verbal particles ‘up’, ‘down’, and so on, may be continuous or
discontinuous with the verb. In Abun, however, the particle is discontinuous when there is a
direct object, as seen in the examples above. When the verb is intransitive, the verbal particle
is continuous with the verb, as in example 5.9:
   5.9        Nan jam we.
              2 sg  move away
              Get out of the way!
   Schachter (1985:45) states that in some languages verbal particles are derived from
adpositions, while in other languages they are not. None of the Abun verbal particles appear
to have been derived from adpositions. Instead, most of the verbal particles are derived from
verbs such as mu ‘go’, ma ‘come’ and kwop ‘die’. Some, such as we ‘away’, are used only
as verbal particles.


5.2 N oun phrases
   An Abun noun phrase typically has the following structure:
                              HEAD (MODIFIERS) (DETERMINER)
    The head of a noun phrase is normally filled by a member of the noun word class as in
example 5.10, but may also be filled by a pronoun, as in 5.11, with a restricted set of
modifiers. In other words, other nouns and adjectives do not co-occur with a pronoun when
it is head of a noun phrase; only classifiers, quantifiers and determiners may co-occur with
pronouns, as seen in 5.11.
68                                                                                      CHAPTER 5


     5.10        Ndar kwo git boge ge we or                              re.
                 dog    white eat fish      CL two completely            perf
                 The white dog had completely eaten the two fish.
     5.11        An ka we ne git boge.
                 3pl cl two det eat fish
                 Those two ate fish.
   A proper name will usually occur alone, but may be modified by a relative clause, as seen
in example 5.12.
     5.12        M auren gato kwop re...
                 Mauren   rel    die     recently
                 Mauren who had died recently...
   Modifiers are optional. The types, their order and co-occurrence restrictions are discussed
below in §5.2.1.
   Determiners, like modifiers, are optional. They are used less frequently than determiners
are in English. They will be discussed in §5.2.2 below.
  Since modifiers and determiners are optional, frequently a noun phrase consists of a single
noun. For example:
     5.13        Fredik bari-wa          git    yetu.
                 Fredik not.want-TRS eat people
                 Fredik does not want to eat people.
    Noun phrases fill subject and object positions, as seen in the examples below. They also
fill head positions in possessive and prepositional phrases and these will be discussed in §5.3
and §5.4 respectively.
     5.14        M en dakai git nok           ku     koi bok       yo.
                 I pl refl eat wild.pig flesh CL several det
                 We ourselves ate several pieces of wild pig meat.
     5.15        Yetu ge w e gwa ndar er             ne    su  kw e koi.
                 people cl two hit dog         red det with wood piece
                 Two men hit the red dog with a piece of wood.


5.2.1 Noun PHRASEMODIFIERS
   All modifiers in noun phrases are posthead. They occur after the head and before any
determiner which may appear. Such modifiers may consist of members from each of the
following classes of words or phrases:
other nouns
       adjectival phrase, consisting of adjectives such as colour (black, white), size (big,
       small) or quality (hard, soft), followed by an optional intensifier
            quantifier phrase, optionally preceded by a classifier, with quantifiers:
                    general (many, few, some)
                    cardinal numerals (one, two...)
                    ordinal numerals (first, second)
PHRASE STRUC1VRE                                                                         69


   These modifiers appear in the noun phrase in the following order:
                   (other   noun ) (adjectival phrase) ( quantifier phrase )
   For example:
   5.16     nok        ku       sye     teker koi        bok       yo
            wild.pig flesh      big     int     CL       several   DET
            Head       Noun Adj P h rase Class           Q uant    Det
            several very big pieces of wild pig meat
   A noun phrase of the type given in the example above, although acceptable to an Abun
speaker, is rather ‘heavy’. By that we mean normally they would not include as many
modifiers together in this way. In order to retain the modification in a more natural style,
various strategies are employed to limit the number of modifiers in any one noun phrase.
These are discussed later in this section.
  Each modifier type will now be discussed with further examples.
   Other nouns may modify the head of a noun phrase. This type of construction is usually
referred to as a complex noun phrase, but since the addition of another noun following the
head modifies the head analogous to other modifiers, we have chosen to discuss it as a
modifier. Examples of this type are:
   5.17     nggwe jam sem           ne
            garden cassava          det
            the cassava garden
  5.18      mbre            toba sak       gri
            eastem.cloth toba CL           three
            three lengths of toba cloth
   The use of adjectival phrases as modifiers of the heads of noun phrases is by far the
most common type of modification. In most cases an adjectival phrase is realised by a single
adjective only, such as colour as in example 5.19, size 5.20, and quality 5.21. This type of
modification follows any other nouns that modify the head of the noun phrase. For more
complex examples of adjectival phrases see §5.5.
  5.19      Ye        gu minda kri.
            people kill butterfly yellow
            They killed yellow butterflies.
  5.20      os     nggwot ne
            path narrow     DET
            the narrow path
  5.21      os    ibit      yo
            way bad         det
            a bad way
  Quantifier phrases may have either a general quantifier, an ordinal numeral or a cardinal
numeral as its head, and is preceded by an optional classifier when the head is a general
quantifier or an ordinal numeral, and an obligatory classifier when the head is a cardinal
numeral. See §5.6 for a discussion of quantifier phrases. Some examples are:
70                                                                                 CHAPTER 5


     5.22        Nggon (ge) mwa ma.
                 woman cl many come
                 Many women came.
     5.23        An    bi      nu        (ke) do-gri.
                 3sg poss house cl            the.one.which-three
                 His house is the third one.
     5.24        Ji ku        ndar sye     ge at.
                 I sg meet dog       big   cl four
                 I found four big dogs.
   There are limitations concerning modifiers within an Abun noun phrase. There are, of
course, semantic restrictions as to which modifiers may co-occur with others, and moreover,
there is pressure to limit the number of modifiers, so that the maximum noun phrase will
normally include only one of each type of modifier. Thus a noun phrase with two adjectives
is unacceptable. If a speaker desires to say something like ‘two big white dogs’, which
involves two adjectives, it is unacceptable to the Abun speaker to use the expression found in
example 5.25; rather, relativisation is usually employed, as in 5.26a, and 5.26b.
     5.25        *ndar kwo sye        ge we
                 dog     white big    CL two

     5.26 a.     ndar kwo ge we goto              sye
                 dog white CL two rel             big
                 1. two white dogs that are big
                 2. two big white dogs
            b.   ndar sye ge         we goto       kwo
                 dog big body two rel              white
                 1. two big dogs that are white
                 2. two big white dogs
   One may posit that the relative clause modifies the noun phrase as a whole since it follows
the determiner, as seen in example 5.27 below. (See further discussion in §5.2.3.)
     5.27        suk wokgan yo          gato men mbrinket
                 thing small      dpt rel     I pl forget
                 1. some small things that we forgot
                 2. some small forgotten things
   Alternatively, the speaker may frequently also juxtapose one of the adjectives in the form
of an appositional verbless clause, as seen in example 5.28. This type of modification is more
typical when the noun phrase fills the object position. In this case the modification is
syntactically outside the noun phrase; it is like a parenthetical comment.
     5.28        ndar kwo     ge     we, ndar ne sye
                 dog white body two dog           det big
                 two white dogs, the dogs are big

5.2.2 D eterminers in noun phrases
   There are five distinct types of determiners used in Abun noun phrases. The first type is
the unspecific/specific distinction. The others are: deictics, anaphoric referents (which refer to
a previously mentioned person/thing), external referents (which refer to the proximity of an
item in relation to the speaker), and reflexives. Both anaphoric and external referents may
compound with deictics. These particles occur in phrase-final position. Table 5.3 lists each
type and the relevant particles, each of which will be discussed in turn below.

                                            TABLE5.3: DETERMINERS

             Type                                         Particles

          Referents                     recent                     then                   then
          External           to-re      is.here       to-ne        is.there   to-tu       is.over.
          Referents                                                                       there
          Reflexive     dakai        self                     wadigan         self alone


  The first determiner type of specificity contrasts unknown/known or unspecific/specific
and requires the use of the particles yo ‘a, some’ (for the former) and ne ‘the’ (for the latter).
The following examples illustrate each of these determiners:
   5.29       An rem kw okw e bo yo.
              3sg had egg.plant cl det
              She had some egg plants, (unspecific quantity)
   5.30       Ye     yo   bi  nggarmom muk yo...
              person det give iron           piece det
              Someone gave some piece of iron... (to him)
   5.31       Nggon ne    it      san     dik yo.
              woman det wear clothes one det
              The woman wore a dress, (known woman, unspecific dress)
   The second type of determiner, the deictic type, has the form re, ne or tu. These refer to
locational or temporal characteristics of the situation within which an utterance takes place. Ye
‘person’ in combination with each of these results in:
              ye re              this person (here)
              ye ne              that person (there)
              ye tu              those people (distant)
   There is a progression from close to near to distant in meaning from re to ne to tu. This
occurs not only in a locative sense, but also in a temporal sense, (recent, not-so-recent to
distant past) as well as in a referential sense, (re ‘this (just previously referred to)’, ne ‘that
72                                                                                           CHAPTER 5


(slightly further removed reference)’ and tu ‘that (distant) (even further removed)’). Each of
these senses is determined from the context.
   Examples of each of the deictics are below. The temporal meaning of now, or at some
other time is seen in examples 5.32 and 5.34; reference to Fredik (meaning the one we know
or can locate, as distinct from other Frediks) in 5.32; and locative meanings of the deictics,
‘here’ in 5.32, ‘there’ in 5.34 and ‘distant’ in 5.35 and 5.36. See Table 3.10 in §3.4 for a list
of these and other determiner compounds.
     5.32    Su   re     Fredik re      kem mo-re                    re.
             with det Fredik det lives loc-det                       perf
             Now this Fredik already lives here.
     5.33    Men ki-bot       suk-du                      ne.
             I pl say-about NOM-speak                     det
             We discussed that news.
     5.34    Su     ne    nggon    ne     ben suk-ibit       mo-ne.
             with det woman det do NOM-bad loc-det
             At that time, that woman did a bad thing there.
     5.35    Ye           ket-bot           nden    tu.
             p e o p le   w a y -a lo n g   bush    dlt
             They went along the distant bush (track).
     5.36    An we ne      mu mo banbo              tu    nim.
             3sg two det go LOC mountain det east
             Those two went to the distant eastern mountain.
   The deictic, tu, can have the meaning ‘respected’, rather than distant, in relation to
old/respected men or women, yenggras tu ‘that old/respected man’ and nggongras tu ‘that
old/respected women’. The idea of respect also encompasses those who are more powerful,
as in the example of a killing party below:
     5.37    Yeko          ne  kwop or                          Yeko            tu
             killing.party det die  completely                  killing.party   DET(respected)
             ana mu            gu      ye          ne or             re.
             TOP go            kill    people      DET completely    PERF
             That killing party died outright. The (other respected/better) killing party were
             the ones who had killed those people outright.
   The third type of determiner is anaphoric referent. One particle, ga, is used to refer back
to a person or thing mentioned. This can be used to distinguish several people of the same
name who could be understood to be part of a story as in the following examples:
     5.38    Ji sok-bot       Yohana ga.
             I sg look-about Yohana an\
             I looked at Yohana (previously mentioned).
     5.39    Prisila ga     sa.
             Prisila anx laugh
             Prisila (previously mentioned) laughed.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                         73

   Or, when a person has been mentioned and the speaker wants to ensure that the hearers
understand that the pronoun, in example 5.40 below, an ‘3sg’, does actually mean the last
person mentioned, the anaphoric referent is added.
   5.40     Ji si       an ga      mu mo nden.
            I sg with 3sg ana go loc bush
            I together with him (previously mentioned) went to the bush.
   This anaphoric referent may then also be combined with the deictics, re, ne or tu to
produce the compounds gare, gane and gatu. (It is on the basis of word-final stress
patterning that these forms are considered as compounds.) The difference between these three
compounds is the proximity of reference in the mind of the speaker. Those persons or things
that were mentioned are referred to by the use of gare ‘this/these, just mentioned’ as in
examples 5.41 and 5.42; gane ‘that/those, just mentioned’ as in 5.43 and 5.44; and gatu
‘that/those, mentioned in the past’ as in 5.45.
  5.41      Nggon w e ga-re         ben suk-ndo.
            women two ANA-here do NOM-good
            These two women do things well.
   5.42     Nggon we ben suk           ga-re          ndo.
            women two do thing ANA-here               good
            The two women did these things well.
  5.43      An git ri              ga-ne.
            3sg eat ginger.root ANA-there
            He ate that ginger root (that one previously mentioned).
  5.44      Ji ku suk-ye             mwa ga-ne.
            I sg get NOM-difficult many ANA-there
            I had those many difficulties.
  5.45      Nin kidar j i     mo nggon ga-tu                 it.
            2pl deceive I sg loc woman ANA-there (distant) cam
            You have deceived me about those women (the ones you talked about in the
            distant past).
   The fourth type of determiner is to, the external referent. This particle refers to the
external setting where the utterance occurs and the proximity of the person or thing under
discussion to that place. When this particle occurs as a free form, it introduces additional
modifying phrases or clauses (see §5.2.3). It may also compound with the deictic particles
re, ne and tu, and is used by a speaker who wants to make reference to something he/she is
touching while speaking; (tore in examples 5.46 and 5.47), or is pointing to while speaking,
(tone in 5.48); or is pointing to in the distance (totu in 5.49).
  5.46      An gwa j i       gro to-re.
            3sg hit    I sg eye EXT-here
            He hit my eye. (speaker is pointing to his eye)
   5.47     M en kem mo kampung to-re.
            I pl live loc village            EXT-here
            We live in this village, (the one where the speaker relates the story)
74                                                                               CHAPTER 5


     5.48   Nan me j i      de     to-ne.
            2sg see I sg blood EXT-there
            See my blood, (the speaker points to it)
     5.49   Nggon w e ma     mo banbo        to-tu.
            women two came loc mountain EXT-there(distant)
            The two women came to that mountain (speaker points to location in the
            distance).
   The final type of determiner is reflexives such as himself, yourself, and themselves. The
form dakai reflexive is used for all persons and numbers and usually co-occurs with a
pronoun or person’s name, as seen in examples 5.50 and 5.51, but also co-occurs with nouns
modified by quantifiers 5.52.
     5.50   Yemina dakai        kon    Barbarina   wip ne    sor.
            I sg         reflcook Barbarina      sore det just
            Just Yemina herself cared for Barbarina’s sore.
     5.51   M en i-wa       men dakai ki-bot             men        dakai.
            I pl happy-TRS I pl refl speak-about I pl               refl
            We ourselves wanted to talk about ourselves.
     5.52   Nggon ge gri       dakai mu.
            woman cl three refl        go
            The three women themselves went.
   In addition, the form w a d ig a n ‘alone’ is reflexive, meaning ‘by himself/alone’, ‘by
itself/alone’, ‘by themselves/alone’ and so on, as in the examples below:
     5.53   s u g it su g e  wadigan
            food animal alone
            1. meat by itself
            2. meat alone
            3. only meat
     5.54   m b re          s y e wadigan
            antique.cloth big alone
            valuable antique cloth alone
   This form implies separateness from other people or things, while dakai implies a
distinctiveness from other people. So in example 5.55, Isak was by himself rowing the
canoe; no-one else was present. Whereas if dakai replaced wadigan, the implication is that
Isak as distinct from the others rowed the canoe; that is, there could have been others with
him in the canoe.
     5.55   Isa k  wadigan mbros kwem.
            Isak alone         row     canoe
            1. Isak rowed the canoe by himself.
            2. Isak alone rowed the canoe.

5.2.3 Post-determiner noun phrase modifiers
   There are other ways to modify a noun phrase apart from using the modifiers discussed
above. Phrases or clauses may be added to a noun phrase by the use of to NOUN modifying
particle, or by the juxtaposition of locative prepositional phrases (in order to modify the head
of the noun phrase in regard to its location). A special case, sino ‘all together’, is also
discussed at the end of this section.
   In these instances an Abun noun phrase consists of:
                       head   (modifiers) (determiner) (modifiers)
   Usually only one modifier follows the determiner, but more than one is possible as in
example 5.68 below.
   The noun modifying particle (nmp) introduces a phrase or clause which modifies the head
of a noun phrase. Phrases and clauses introduced by nmp are added to the noun phrase and
modify it. Consider the following example:
   5.56      Wo suk-fo       to          ndam    syor   ne      yo,              nu-we
             but thing-taboo NMP          bird    cassowary     det   then.iRR   2PL-two
             git nde.
             eat NEG
             But the cassowary is taboo, you must not eat it.
   The phrase ‘the cassowary’, introduced by the nmp, modifies the forbidden thing. Again in
example 5.57 below, the noun banbo ‘mountain’ is modified by the addition of the phrase
‘the Waibe’.
   5.57      M en gwa bei yamo banbo             to       Waibe ne   de    rut.
             I pl beat sago at       mountain nmp        Waibe DET side far
             We beat the sago on the mountain, that is on Waibe mountain on the far side.
  The nmp also joins unrestrictive relative clauses to a noun phrase in order to modify a
noun, as seen in the following example:
   5.58      An k i nai       Martinus     to-re      to  kra   Domingas
             3sg say to       Martinus     EXT-this   REL marry Domingas
             ne bi      ai    gum do Simam Yorfen do...
             DET POSS father name COM Simam Yorfen COM
             He said to Martinus’ father (the Martinus who lives here, who married
             Domingas) (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that...
   When sa ‘like, as’ compounds with to, the compound form sato ‘for example/such as’
results. The use of this form precedes complex noun phrases which are added to modify or
explain the head of the noun phrase, as seen in the example below. (See §5.7 for more details
on complex noun phrases.)
76                                                                                      CHAPTER 5


     5.59   Regina      ben siri     su pa         yesok    sato      Arnol       e
            Regina      do wrong     with child    youth    such.as   Amol        and
            Lambertus e.
            Lambertus and
            Regina committed adultery with (some) young men such as Amol and
            Lambertus.
   Furthermore the anaphoric referent ga also compounds with to and forms gato, the
relative conjunction, which is used to form restrictive relative clauses. Examples show how
these forms modify the nouns in the phrases below. Note that the form ne ‘det’ is frequently
a relative clause boundary marker, as distinct from the same form used as a determiner in the
noun phrase.
     5.60   Suk-jan      gato an          jan m o nggwe ne         here    te.
            NOM-plant rel       3pl      plant loc garden det      later   die
            Plants that they plant in that garden will die.
     5.61    M en mu de      syur      mo syur wak gato nje                      ben      ne.
             I pl go go.in water loc water hole rel               people         make     det
             We went and washed at the well that people had made.
     5.62    Yenggras gato Mauren gato kwop re          anato ma.
             elder     rel Mauren   rel die    recently foc     come
             The elder whose (name was) Mauren who died recently was the one who
             came.
   Such clauses also modify the head of a noun phrase, and are one possible option where
the speakers desire to include more than one adjectival type of modification to a noun phrase
as explained in §5.2.1 above. For more details regarding restrictive and unrestrictive relative
clauses, see §9.
    A locative prepositional phrase frequently modifies the head of a noun phrase, as in the
following examples. The clothes spoken of in example 5.63 are ‘clothes at the sea’ which
modifies the noun, clothes. The resulting meaning is modem clothes as distinct from ‘clothes
in the bush’ (the traditional bark cloth worn in the bush).
     5.63    san     m o sem ne
             clothes LOC sea       det
             modem clothes (‘sea’ clothes cf. ‘bush’ clothes)
   Other locative prepositional phrases modify the noun by indicating its location. Thus it is
clear in example 5.64 which garden and in 5.65 and 5.66 which people are being spoken
about.
     5.64    mo nggwe mo banbo                  to-tu      nim
             LOC garden loc mountain EXT-there(distant) east
             at the garden on the distant eastern mountain
     5.65    Nin      mo F e f ma    mo Syumr Sye.
             2   pl   locFef came loc Syurur Sye
             1. You Fef (people) come to Syurur Sye.

             Many people in the house fought each other.
   Finally, there is a special modifier that occurs after determiners: sino ‘all/together’. Sino is
always the final constituent of a noun phrase whenever it occurs as seen in examples 5.67
and 5.68. It modifies the whole phrase in a similar way to relative clauses. This is similar
also to English where ‘all’ modifies the whole noun phrase as in ‘all the king’s men...’.
   5.67      y enggras mwa ne         sino
             old.men many det all
             all the many old respected men

             person-family other rel loc land this all
             all the other tribes which are in this land
   This modifier is out of character with all the other single-word modifiers in that it follows
the determiner. It could be that it was originally a phrase (si no ‘with completeness’) that has
compounded to form the single word. In that case sino would be considered as a noun
phrase itself and the whole utterance would be considered as two noun phrases conjoined,
with si no being the second noun phrase. For further discussion of complex phrases see
§5.7.


5.3 Possessive phrases
   Abun has two types of possessive constructions which, in other languages, have been
referred to as ‘alienable’ and ‘inalienable’ possession (Crystal 1985:12). Alienable
possession is that type of possession where the item possessed (hereafter known as
possessum) is seen as having only a temporary or non-essential dependence on the
possessor, such as ‘his house’ or ‘the woman’s book’. On the other hand, inalienable
possession is where the possessum has a permanent or necessary relationship with the
possessor such as ‘her arm’.
   Of the ten different genitive construction types discussed by Croft (1990:28-32), Abun
makes use of only two, and uses them to distinguish between alienable and inalienable
possession. The first of these construction types used in Abun is simple juxtaposition of two
noun phrases; one representing the possessor and one representing the possessum. This type
of construction is used to form Abun inalienable genitive constructions, as in example 5.69.
Frequently the noun phrases are realised by only a pronoun and a noun, juxtaposed in that
order, as seen in 5.70.
   5.69      Ndar sye ne      gwes de-dari fot.
             dog big det leg           side-back broken
             Possessor(NP)    Possessum(NP)
             The big dog’s back leg is broken.
   5.70      Ji syim fot.
             I sg arm  broken
             My arm was broken.
78                                                                                   CHAPTER 5


   A less common strategy discussed by Croft (1990:32) is that of the use of a linker. He
says, “The linker is invariant or contrasts only with simple juxtaposition, and functions
merely to link the possessor and head noun grammatically”. This is the second type of
genitive construction found in Abun. Abun alienable genitive constructions use this type of
strategy. The possessive marker bi is a linker. It links the possessor and the possessum, as
seen in examples 5.71, 5.72 and 5.73.
     5.71    Gap sye ne bi              gan          ge we kwop re.
             rat   big det poss         young.one cl two die     perf
             Possessor                  Possessum
             The big rat’s two young   offspring had died.
     5.72    Ji ben j i     bi nggwe.
             I sg do   I sg poss garden
             I made my garden.
     5.73    Ji bi      pa     ge w e mu          mo     nu.
             I sg poss child cl two go            loc   house
             My two children went home.
   The noun phrase that represents the possessor undergoes no morphological change when
it is juxtaposed or linked to the possessum. The possessum likewise is not marked
morphologically in any way. Even the linker, bi, can be shown to be a free form (and will be
in §5.3.2) and thus be considered separate from both the possessum and the possessor. Abun
possessive phrases syntactically appear to be like coordinate noun phrases, one form
juxtaposed and the other using the linker bi as the coordinating particle, just as si is used to
conjoin noun phrases (see §5.7).
   Consistent with the absence of morphological marking in possessive phrases noted here,
Abun does not have a set of possessive pronouns, but uses the same set of pronouns as are
used in all other phrase types. In contrast to this, in an early cursory analysis of Abun
(previously named Karon), Voorhoeve wrote (in Wurm 1975:720) that possessive prefixes
had been noted with kinship terms: tabai ‘my father’ and nambai ‘your father’, being cited
as examples. However in slow speech these two forms are: tat bi ai ‘I sg poss father: my
father’ and nan bi ai12sg POSS father: your father’ (these phrases are in the Abun Tat dialect,
where tat is ‘I sg’). No markings are made on either the head or the dependent in possessive
phrases. The same pronouns are employed in possessive phrases as in noun phrases that
occur in subject and object positions, that is, there is no special set o f possessive pronouns
in Abun. In this way Abun differs from many other languages.
   The choice of which type of possessive construction to employ is determined by the
lexicon. The inalienable class of nouns which includes body parts, name, and analogously,
the parts of whole-part relationships such as trunk of tree and scales of fish (as discussed in
§3.3.2.3), is restricted and could be considered a closed set. All other nouns belong to an
open set of nouns and include names of places, objects, kinship terms, and advice. Many
languages with the alienable/inalienable distinction include kinship terms in the inalienable
category, but, in Abun, kinship terms are considered to be alienable.
   Now we turn to a more detailed discussion of each of the two types of genitive
constructions, inalienable (§5.3.1) and alienable (§5.3.2).
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                          79

5.3.1 Inalienable possession
   Abun inalienable possessive phrases may be represented as:
                               np [possessor] np [possessum]

where for pronominal reference the possessor may be replaced by /-, in the case of non­
human referents, or be elided in the case of body part referents.
   In inalienable possession, the possessor and the possessum are simply juxtaposed as in
example 5.74. This type of possessive construction is used for body parts (such as my arm,
his leg) and more generally for whole-part relationships (such as tree-leaves, deer-meat,
house-opening (doorway)). Also a person’s name is considered as an inalienable possession,
as in 5.75 and 5.76.
   5.74     Wo Kwai tik Sepenyel gwes.
            fish kwai pull Sepenyel leg
            The Kwai fish pulled Sepenyel’s leg.
   5.75     An    gum do Marta.
            3sg name COM Marta
            Her name is Marta.
   5.76     Marta gum sye do          Yekese.
            Marta name big com Yekese
            Marta’s surname is Yekese.
   Whole-part relationships, in principle, follow the same structure as inalienable possessive
phrases, and could be analysed as separate words or as compounds. Here they are analysed
as compounds since the possessum is a bound root. It never stands on its own in normal
utterance. It is structurally bound to the preceding word, which represents the ‘whole’. So
rom ‘liquid’ in example 5.77 is bound to gur ‘coconut’. No evidence has been found that
words like rom have ever been free forms.
   5.77     Ji     da     gur-rom.
            I sg drink coconut-liquid
            I drink coconut milk.
  The ‘whole’ may not just be a single word, but may also be a noun phrase, for example ‘a
young coconut’, that compounds with the bound root, ‘liquid’, as seen in example 5.78.
   5.78     da      [gur      bo   dek]-rom         si     git i-ka         nde e...
            drink coconut cl       young-liquid with eat its-flesh          neg and
            don’t drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh, and...
   There is one structural difference between inalienable possessive phrases and ‘whole-part’
compounds. The difference is that the possessor in the phrase may be elided, whereas in the
compound it cannot. In the latter case, the possessor or ‘whole’ is replaced with a prefix i-.
For example, a free form (or the ‘whole’ in whole-part relationships), such as kwe ‘tree’ in
example 5.79, can be replaced by the non-human possessive pronoun prefix, i-, as seen in
5.80. (See §3.3.2.4 for further discussion about the i- prefix.)
80                                                                                               CHAPTER 5


     5.79        Ji       yo            kwe-muk              e       kwe-guk.
                 lSG      g a th e r    tre e -tru n k       and     tre e -b ra n c h
                 I g a th e r e d u p th e tru n k s a n d b ra n c h e s .

     5.80        Ji       yo             i-m uk          e         i-guk.
                 lSG      g a th e r    its -tru n k     and       its-b ra n c h
                 I g a th e r e d u p th e tru n k s a n d b ra n c h e s .

   However for body parts the possessum is an unbound form. The i- prefix is not used with
this type of construction when the possessor is elided. So when, say, an arm is referred to on
subsequent occasions, the free form of the possessum is sufficient and ellipsis of the
possessor is acceptable, as seen in example 5.81.
     5.81        M en sorom men syim. M en sorom syim mo                                 nu.
                 lPL  shake   lPL    hand I p l shake hands LOC                          house
                 We shook hands. We shook hands in the house.
   Both body parts and whole-part relationships can be combined as in examples 5.82 and
5.83. In the latter case, the nails belong to the fingers, which belong to the arm (whole-part
relationships) and the arm belongs to him (body-part relationship).
     5.82        Prisila sap Moses syim-brot toko re.
                 Prisila cut Moses arm-vein apart perf
                 Prisila had cut Moses’ veins in his arm apart.
     5.83 a.     Yen gwat an syim-sopkwa-bris.
                 3pl cut     3sg arm-finger-nail
                 They cut his fingernails.
            b.   Yen gwat an syim sopkwa                                  bris.
                 3pl cut     3sg arm       finger                         nail
                 They cut his fingernails.
   An alternative analysis of whole-part relationship structures is shown in 5.83b above.
Each item here is treated as a separate word and, in this case, sopkwa bris is an inalienable
posessive phrase which is juxtaposed to and modifies another inalienable possessive p h ra s e ,
an syim.


5.3.2 Alienable possession
     Abun alienable possessive phrases consist of:
                                         np [possessor]            bi   np [possessum]

   This structure is used for all possessive phrases, except for those discussed above. The
possessor noun phrase is commonly realised as a pronoun as in example 5.84, proper name
as in 5.85, and may also be a longer noun phrase as in 5.86. The possessum is a noun phrase
which is commonly realised by a single noun as in 5.85 or may be a longer expression as in
5.87.
     5.84        An    bi    nggon jam     nde to.
                 3sg poss wife       know neg incam
                 His wife didn’t know yet.

             Andar po s s mother come
             Andar’s mother came.
   5.86      Yetu       ge        dik yo          bi        nu           anane.
             person c l   one dht po ss                     house        dem
             This is someone’s house.
   5.87      Ji     mu mo ji                 bi         nggwe jamsem              nim ne.

             I w e n t to m y e a s te rn c a s s a v a g a rd e n .

   The linker, bi, is a free morpheme. Sometimes the possessor can be elided from the
linker, as in example 5.88. Sometimes the possessum can also be elided from the linker, as
in 5.89. It is also possible for both possessor and possessum to be elided, as in 5.90, leaving
the linker stand on its own. In all cases this may occur only when the possessor and
possessum are recoverable from the context. For example, in 5.90, it is known that the
possessum is a wife because that was the topic of discussion.
   5.88      Sadrak bi       im         re   ben bi      suk ot ye.
             Sadrak po ss mother dem do po ss thing sharp very
             1. Sadrak’s mother does her things very callously.
             2. Sadrak’s mother is callous.
  5.89      Markus it         mo kwem wokgan gato Martinus bi                                         ne.

            Markus got into the canoe which was Martinus’.
  5.90      Nan kra   bi                     bado       M oses kra      bi,              bado   nin

            me-wa     ndo.
             see-TRS  good
            If you are going to marry yours (wife), or Moses marry his (wife), then take
            good care (of them).
   The Abun possessive phrase construction influences the way Abun speakers construct
their Indonesian. Instead of using standard Indonesian, rumah saya ‘my house’, they say
saya punya rumah, as in example 5.91. The word punya means ‘to have, possess’ in
Indonesian; however, standard Indonesian does not employ ‘have’ in possessive phrase
constructions.
  Indonesian:
   5.91      Saya punya    rumah roboh.
             I sg     po sshouse fallen.down
             My house has fallen down.
  Alienable possessive phrases may be intensified by the addition of i. In this case the form
would be:
                                    np [possessor]          bi   np [possessum]    i
82                                                                                           CHAPTER 5


  This particle changes the intensity of possession in a similar way to the English, ‘his own
house’, as distinct from ‘his house’. The following examples illustrate this type of phrase:
     5.92    ji    bi           nu          i
              I sg po ss        h o u s e int
             m y ow n h o u se

     5.93    an      bi       bur               i
             3sg po ss la n d                   int
             his o w n la n d
   This type of construction is further used to distinguish two different ownerships in
contrast to each other, as in the following:
     5.94    Ji bi      bur i      anare,       nan bi       bur i  anatu.
             I sg po ss la n d int DEM(here) 2sg po ss la n d int DEM(there)
             This is my own land here, that is your own land there.
     5.95    Yewon         bi        sukduno i               tara            re
             sham an       po ss     te a c h in g    int    d iffe re n t   perf

             Yefu n bi     sukduno i        tara       re.
             God     po ss teaching  int    different PERF
             The shaman’s own teachings are different to God’s own teachings.


5.3.3 Recursive possessive phrases
   Possessive phrases may be embedded within one another, for alienable possession, by the
addition of the linker and the possessum, as in examples 5.96 and 5.97, or for inalienable
possession, by the addition of the possessum, as in 5.98.
     5.96    Rahel    bi      ai     bi nyom
             Rachel po ss father poss machete
             Rachel’s father’s machete
     5.97    An    bi    nji        bi                      nggon       bi        nu
             3sg po ss brother po ss                        wife        po ss     h o u se
             His brother’s wife’s house
     5.98    Rahel    bi      ai   syim
             Rachel po ss father arm
             Rachel’s father’s arm


5.4 P repositional phrases
    Prepositional phrases consist of a noun phrase preceded by a preposition. Prepositional
phrases fill dative, locative, instrumental and other adjunct positions in the sentence. Table 5.4
is a list of the prepositions used in Abun with their English equivalent, and categorised into
four different general types. This is Table 3.7 repeated here for convenience.
    A general feature of prepositional phrases that will be illustrated below is the possibility of
ellipsis of the head of the phrase, leaving the preposition stand alone. In such cases the head
is readily recoverable from the context.

because bi only links two noun phrases, whereas this group of prepositions is used for verb
(predicate)-argument np relations. Each preposition will be discussed in turn.


5.4.1 Dative phrases
   A phrase filling the dative function is a prepositional phrase with either is or nai as the
preposition. These two prepositions are dialectal variants, is is used in Abun Ji and nai is
used in Abun Ye and Abun Tat. This prepositional phrase type is distinguished from other
types because Abun speakers strongly prefer to place it directly following the object of the
sentence.
   As with all prepositional phrases, the preposition precedes a noun phrase such as a
possessive phrase as in example 5.99, a noun phrase as in 5.100, or the ellipsis thereof as in
5.101.
   5.99 a. Nggon ne syo suk-ne                nai an           bi        im .
           girl      dem   give nom - dem     to   3sg         POSS      mother
           That girl gave those things to her mother.
           b. Nggon ne        syo     suk-ne      is a n       bi        im .
              girl      dem   give nom - dem      to 3sg       POSS      mother
              That girl gave those things to her mother.
   5.100         Ji      nuk     suk-mwa        ne is p a      w ok      ne.
                 I sg speak thing-many det to child            small     DET
                 I told all those things to the small child.
   5.101         Pa    bi    im      syo syur is da             nde.
                 child poss mother give water to drink neg
                 The child’s mother must not give water to (the child) to drink.

5.4.2 Spacio-temporal phrases
   A group of phrases with the prepositions mo, bot, kagit, karowa, ket and wade generally
have locative, directional or temporal notions. Locative (mo) prepositional phrases are by far
the most common type, and they differ structurally to the other types in this category. Again,
each spacio-temporal prepositional phrase consists of a preposition followed by a noun
phrase. Of the several prepositions listed in the table above under this type, each will be
discussed in turn below.

(i)   mo
      Mo is the general locative preposition meaning ‘in, at, to’, as seen in the examples below:
      5.102     Ye        mu       nai su-git                 mo nggwe.
                p e o p le g o     get      NOM-eat           loc       g a rd e n
                They    w e n t to g e t fo o d a t th e g a rd e n .

      5.103     M en mu mo Filipus bi      nu.
                I pl go loc Filipus po ss house
                We went to Filipus’ house.
  Several locative prepositional phrases may occur together such as in example 5.104. Both
mo and bot have a tendency for recursiveness. The limitations to the number of phrases
appear to be pragmatic.
      5.104     Yen        taru          mu   mo nje          mo nden                 mo Syubun.
                p e o p le send.message go    loc p e o p le loc    bush              lo c Syubun
                They sent a message to the people in the bush at Syubun.
   Mo is a general locative preposition, and when a more specific location, such as ‘in front
of’, ‘next to’, or ‘behind’ is intended, another locative word further specifies the location.
Such modifications are found only in locative prepositional phrases where the preposition is
mo. For example:

                         mo nu mit                       inside the house
                         mo nu git                       in front of the house
                         m onuyu                         on top of the house
                         mo      nu ke                   at the base of the house
                         mo      nu ndet                 in between the houses
                         mo      nu m m                  above the house
                         mo      banbo nim               eastern mountain
                         mo      nu de                   at the side of the house
                         mo      nu de ju                upstream side of the house
                         mo      nu de ti                sea side of the house
                         mo      nu de dari              behind the house
                         mo      nu de rut               at the back of the house
                         mo      nu des nak              underneath the house
                         mo      nu de nden              outside the house
PHRASE STRUCWRE                                                                            85

   These locative words which follow the head of a locative phrase could be described as
‘relator nouns’. They can become the head of the phrase when the actual head of the phrase is
elided, such as mo mil ‘inside (the house)’, and mo nden ‘outside (the house)’.
   Many of the relator nouns are preceded by de ‘side’, as can be seen in the list above. So
the form of the locative prepositional phrase may be further defined as: mo + NP, where an
additional modifier, a relator noun or [de + relator noun] can be included preceding the
determiner and following other modifiers in the noun phrase, such as in examples 5.105a and
5.106a.
    When the same directional word or relator noun follows the determiner of the phrase the
meaning is different. Compare example 5.105a with 5.105b, and 5.106a with 5.106b. In the
latter cases the directional word is now outside of the prepositional phrase. When it is within
the prepositional phrase (which has its boundary delineated by the determiner) it modifies the
head of the phrase.
   5.105 a. mo banbo         sye nim
            LOC mountain big east det
            on the big eastern mountain
           b.    mo banbo      sye ne      nim
                LOC mountain big det east
                on the big mountain in the easterly direction
   5.106 a.      mo Nyarwon bi          nu    de j u               ne
                LOC Nyarwon poss house side upstream               det
                on the upstream side of Nyarwon’s house
           b.    mo Nyarwon bi      nu        ne de ju
                loc Nyarwon poss house det side upstream
                at Nyarwon’s house, upstream side
  Recursive prepositional phrases may also include relator words. For example:
   5.107        mo nggwe         mo banbo          tatu     nim
                LOC garden       loc mountain distant       east
                at the garden on the distant eastern mountain
   5.108        mo     nggwe    more ju
                loc    garden    close upstream
                at the nearby upstream garden
   More than one relator noun in either order (yu nim or nim yu) can modify the noun head
of a phrase. For example:
   5.109 a.     mo banbo          yu nim ne
                loc  mountain top east det
                on the top of the eastern mountain
           b. mo      banbo       nim yu ne
                loc   mountain east top det
                on the top of the eastern mountain
86                                                                                  CHAPTER 5


(ii) subot/bot
   Bot, which is a shortening of subot, introduces a phrase which could be described as
perlative in meaning, that is ‘about, along or through’. Bot is preferred in fast speech. The
following examples illustrate this type of prepositional phrase. Bot has undergone a process
of grammaticalisation to become a suffix on some verbs, as discussed in §3.3.1.
     5.110    Pa         siker nok         bot    kwa-yo-kwa-yo.
              young.man tease wild.pig about thing-a-thing-a
              The young men teased the wild pig about many things.
     5.111    An   mu subot yen ne ket             ya ne.
              3 sg go along sand det west flat det
              He went along the sand in a westerly direction on the flat part.
   This type of prepositional phrase can be recursive, as in example 5.112. Speakers have a
strong preference for bot phrases to precede mo phrases, as seen in 5.113, and, when the
noun phrase is recoverable from the context, ellipsis of the phrase itself is possible, leaving
only the preposition as in 5.114.
     5.112    An     saye bot      nu       bot     nden  nu      de     ne ju.
              3 sg   shout about house about outside house side det upstream
              1. She shouted (for me) about the houses, about the outside of the houses just
              up to the upstream side (of the village).
              2. She shouted out (for me) outside each house on the upstream side (of the
              village).
     5.113    An gu        bot     rus      mo kampung      ne.
              3sg kill about family loc village              det
              She killed all the families in the village.
     5.114    Nggon mise syun ma             bot.
              woman evil chase come about
              The evil woman chased after (them).

(iii) kagit/kadit
   Here again is a dialect variation, kadit and kagit are identical in meaning and use. This
preposition has several shades of meaning. The basic meaning is ‘from’, and this can be
from a location as in example 5.115, a situation as in 5.116, or a point in time as in 5.117.
     5.115    An ma      kagit Filipus bi          nu.
              3sg come from Filipus POSS           house
              He came from Filipus’s house.
     5.116    An ge        kadit an      bi   suki ne.
              3sg healed from 3sg poss sickness DET
              He is healed from the sickness.
     5.117    Ji     ben kadit ketke             sor kom mo-re.
              I sg do from beginning only until LOC-here
              I have just done (that) all the time up until now.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                         87

(iv) karowa
   The preposition karowa means ‘near, close to’, and may also be used as an adverb. Its
main use is locative as in examples 5.118 and 5.119a, but it is also used in a temporal sense
as in 5.120. In some contexts the head of the phrase can be elided, leaving the preposition
stand alone as in 5.119b.
   5.118      M en mu mo os          m it    karowa nu-ari                Ebenezer.
              I pl go LOC road middle near               house-Sunday Ebenezer
              We were walking on the middle of the road near the church, Ebenezer.
   5.119 a. Nan yo mu karowa M oses bi               pe i   nde.
            2sg neg go        near     Moses poss place own nbg
            You are not to go near Moses’ own place.
           b. Nan mu karowa nde.
              2sg go near         neg
              Don’t go near (Moses’ place).
   5.120      Karowa kam         dek...
              near       sun     cool
              Close to sunset...

(v) ket
   The form ket is another locative preposition. It precedes the location of the path of the
action. For example, the location of the path where goods were being carried in example
5.121 is along the ground, that is by foot, and the location of the path of the movement in
5.122 was towards the interior (rather than the sea). The preposition undergoes
grammaticalisation to become a suffix on some verbs and this is discussed in §3.3.1.
   5.121      M en sam suk         ket bur.
              I pl carry things LOC earth
              We carried the things, walking along.
   5.122      M en tot ket nden.
              I pl cut loc interior
              We cut across to the interior (path).
   5.123      Pa mu ket os            kwa      syu ne.
              child go loc path the.one long dbt
              The child went on the long path.
   5.124      Ji ben ket ji          i.
              I sg do     loc I sg desires
              I did (things) according to my desires.

(vi) wade/kommo
   Another type of spacio-temporal prepositional phrase is formed with the preposition
wade/kom mo ‘until/for’. These two forms are used interchangeably. For example:
88                                                                                       CHAPTER 5


     5.125 a. M en kem mone wade kam -gwe                   rek.
              lPL live     there    for      day- two       full
              We stayed there for two full days.
             b. M en kem mone kom mo                    kam-gwe       rek.
                I pl live    there    until LOC         day-two       full
                We stayed there for two full days.
     5.126      An gw at     su   kre           re     mu    wade noru       m it
                3sg take     with afternoon     this   go    until night     middle
                jam musi.
                 hour nine
                 He took it from this afternoon until the middle of the night, nine o’clock.


5.4.3 Associative phrases
   The preposition used for associative as well as instrumental and temporal prepositional
phrases is su. Su is mainly used in prepositional phrases that carry a sense of association. The
examples below illustrate an ‘association’ with humans as in examples 5.127 and 5.128, and
also things, such as those in the canoe with Isak in 5.129.
     5.127      Nan sam kwem su                Isak.
                2sg carry canoe with           Isak
                Carry the canoe with Isak.
     5.128      An grem pa            su    an      bi      im.
                3sg put       child with 3sg        poss    mother
                She left the child with her mother.
     5.129      Isak mbros kwem su             suk       e     bukur e             ne.
                Isak row       canoe with things          and bowls and            det
                Isak rowed the boat with things, bowls and so on.
   Furthermore the preposition can by itself act as a proform for the whole phrase in cases
where, from the context, the contents of the phrase are known. In the example below, the
speaker was talking about his wife’s sickness and how it necessitated the construction of a
house in the bush. So he built the house ‘with that situation in mind’, and only requires the
preposition su to communicate that. There is no need for a pause or any other phonological
device to signify this phrase. Another phrase beginning with the preposition mo makes it
clear that the su phrase has been completed.
     5.130      Ji     go      nu      wok su         mo      nden ne.
                lSG build house small with loc bush det
                I built a small house (with that situation in mind) in the bush.
     Examples of phrases where su has an instrumental meaning are:
     5.131      Alfon gwa Simon su           kwe koi           sye.
                Alfon hit Simon with wood piece                big
                Alfon hit Simon with a big piece of wood.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                               89

   5.132     Ji kon        an gwes su         weu   gan.
             I sg cook 3sg leg          with banana young
             I treated his leg with a young banana.
   5.133     An gu      M usa su     an bi            ini bi                nggarm om   muk.
             3sg kill   Musa with 3sg poss mother POSS                      iron        pipe
             He killed Musa with his mother’s iron pipe.
  In context all but the preposition in a prepositional phrase may be elided. This is a
common feature for all prepositional phrases. Thus, in a discussion about going to get a
young banana tree and bringing it back home to prepare a treatment, one could then say,
   5.134     Be j i        kon     an    gwes su.
             later I sg    cook 3sg leg            with
             Later I will treat his leg with (it).
   The use of su can also include temporal ideas; the phrase, ‘with the cool sun’ means ‘in
the late afternoon’. It may be sentence-initial as in example 5.135, or part of the predicate
following the verb as in 5.136 and 5.137, while 5.138 shows how the preposition itself may
be sufficient where the phrase is elided.
   5.135     Su fu tm o ne           an   kra    su  Larnber.
             with first       det 3sg marry with Lamber
             In the first place, she married Lamber.
   5.136     Prisila ti       su    noru       ne mu mo an                  bi     im.
             Prisila flee with night           det go      loc 3sg          poss   mother
             Prisila fled at/during the night to her mother.
   5.137     M en ne syesyar      su tahun                m usyu   mofit.
             I pl det came.out with year                  ten      seven
             We came out in 1970.
   5.138     Tahun ne anato               men syesyar        su.
             yeardet the.one. which       I pl  came.out with
             That was the year in which we came out from the jungle.
   Su, which has an associative notion, can be replaced with si, which is used for
coordination of noun phrases, as discussed below in §5.7.1. On some occasions, Abun
speakers split coordinate noun phrases around the verb as in example 5.139a. When that
occurs, si acts like a preposition equivalent to su, as in 5.139b. In such a case su would also
be acceptable, as seen in 5.139c. There is a progression from closer coordination to looser
coordination of the participants, from 5.139a to 5.139c. When a coordinate noun phrase is
not split around the verb, su cannot replace si, as in 5.139d. Usually coordinate noun phrases
are not split. In more than 90% of the occurrences in the data, speakers do not split coordinate
noun phrases; instead they prefer to keep them together, as in 5.139a, rather than split as in
5.139b.
   5.139 a. Apner si     Fredik si     Musa git sugit.

5.4.4 BenefactivePHRASES
  The benefactive/purposive phrase has the preposition wa ‘for’. This preposition has
undergone a process of grammaticalisation as discussed in §3.3.1. Its common use is in
benefactive prepositional phrases. For example:
     5.140      Ye     fro        suk      wa men      ka gri.
                people prepare things for lPL          CL three
                They prepared things for us three.
     5.141      Ji kon       wa ji     bi     nu       ne  sor.
                I sg cook for lSG POSS house           DET only
                I only cook for my household.
     5.142      Sugane       ye      mu wa kam sye mo Uigwem.
                at.that.time people go       for day      big LOC Uigwem
                At that time they went for the celebrations at Uigwem.
   The preposition wa is also a conjunction. In the following example, the first wa is a
purpose conjunction and the second a benefactive/purpose preposition.
     5.143      An ben mbros wa an mu wa Isak.
                3sg do    oar      for 3sg go         for Isak
                He made an oar so he could go for (to help) Isak.


5.5 Adverbial and adjectival phrases
     Adverbial phrases in Abun consist of:
                                     Adverb + ( intensieier)
   Usually the optional intensifier is absent, leaving a single adverb as head of the phrase.
This phrase type is limited in that only two particles can be used to intensify adverbs. The
particle wai, which comes from the verb ‘to pass’, acts as an intensifier with adverbs. It has
the sense of a surpassing manner of action. In other words, it is a comparative form. Thus, in
example 5.144a, wai gives the idea that the speaker told his story much quicker than anyone
else. However, the other intensifier, teker, has more of a superlative idea, so kokro teker can
mean either ‘fastest’, or ‘too fast’, depending on the context. Frequently the use of teker
implies intensified action militating against achieving its desired result; so in 5.144b ‘He told
the story too quickly’ implies that the hearers were prevented from understanding the story
clearly.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                              91

   5.144 a. A n       ki    suk-du       ne    kokro    wai.
                3 sg  say NOM-say        det fast       int
                He told the story very quickly.
           b. An       k i suk-du       ne kokro       teker.
                3 sg  say NOM-say det fast              int
                He told the story too quickly.
   Adverbial phrases occur after the object of a transitive sentence, as in example 5.144, or
after the verb of an intransitive sentence, as in the following example:
   5.145        Isak kas nggi          wai.
                Isak run strong int
                1. Isak runs very strongly.
                2. Isak is a very strong runner.
   Adjectival phrases are similar to adverbial phrases in that they consist of a head modified
by an intensifier, that is, adjectival phrases consist of:
                                     ADJECTIVE + (INTENS1F1ER).
  Usually the optional intensifier is absent, leaving a single adjective as head of the phrase.
   Intensifiers used in adjectival phrases are the same as in adverbial phrases, with the
addition of ye ‘very’ and ndo nde ‘good NEC: very (with negative connotations)’ as seen in
the examples below. For extra intensification ye may occur with ndo nde, as in example
5.147b.
  5.146 a.      N d a r s y e wai m a    j a u ji.
                dog big int come bite I sg
                A very big dog (bigger than normal) came and bit me.
           b. N d a r s y e teker m a  ja u j i .
              dog big int         come bite I sg
              An extremely big dog came and bit me.
           c. N d a r s y e ye m a    ja u ji.
              dog big int come bite I sg
              A very big dog came and bit me.
           d. N d a r s y e ndo nde ma        jau       ji.
              dog big good nbg come bite                 I sg
              A very big dog came and bit me.
  5.147 a.       sugit mo nu          sare       sugum sye ndo nde
                food loc house like.that money big good NEC
                in a restaurant like that the food is very expensive
           b.    sugit mo nu          sare       sugum sye ye          ndo   nde
                food loc house like.that money big very good                 neg
                in a restaurant like that the food is very, very expensive
  The intensifier ye differs from wai in that ye does not convey any comparative notions as
does wai.
92                                                                                          CHAPTER 5


   The general quantifier mwa ‘many’ may also be intensified in the same way as both
adjectives and adverbs, as the following examples show:
     5.148 a. yetu   mwa teker
              people many int
              too many people
             b. yetu    mwa wai
                 people many int
                 very many people
     5.149      Nggon   ne ben siri      mwa ye.
                woman det do wrong many very
                The woman has done many, many wrong things.
     5.150      Nggon  ne ben siri         su ye        mwa ye      ndo                  nde.
                woman det do wrong with people many very good                            neg
                The woman has done wrong things with many, many people.


5.6 Quantifier phrases
     A quantifier phrase consists of:
                                     (classifier*)      quantifier
                             (*a classifier is obligatory for cardinal numerals)

   A classifier indicates something about the shape or size of an object that is head of a noun
phrase, in the same way as ‘loaves’ in the English, three loaves of bread. There are many
types of classifiers that may be used depending upon the type of noun in the phrase head,
such as ge for persons or animals; and gwes for long items like pieces of bamboo. In §3.4.1,
Table 3.9 lists each classifier and the types of nouns to which they apply.
  General quantifiers are mwa ‘many’, bok ‘several’ and de ‘some/part’. With more
commonly used nouns, classifiers have a greater tendency to be absent. Some examples are:
     5.151      yenggras (ge) bok           ne
                old.men     cl     several det
                the several old respected men
     5.152      yenggras (ge) mwa ne
                old.men    CL many DET
                the many old respected men
     5.153      M en git weu        (bo) de    yo.
                I pl   eat banana cl      some det
                We ate some of the bananas.
     5.154      Minda     kri     (ge) mwa ok        kadit pe                      ne.
                butterfly yellow cl many fly from place                            det
                Many yellow butterflies flew away from that place.
     5.155      An    nai jam sem     (is)        mwa.
                3sg   get cassava     CL          many
                He took many cassava.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                            93

   An Ordinal numeral, which may be head of a quantifier phrase, is formed by a
combination of do ‘the one which’ and the numeral, except for do-ketke ‘first’, or the
dialectal variant, do-futmo ‘first’. A classifier is optional with these. Some examples are:
   5.156     warn do-ketke
             time the.one.which-one
             first time
   5.157     nu          gwes kok          kw at do-gri
             house leg        high platform the.one.which-three
             the house on stilts’ third level
   5.158     An     git weu       (bo) do-at.
             3sg eat banana cl       the.one.which-four
             He is eating the fourth banana.
   Cardinal numerals may also be head of a quantifier phrase. Classifiers, however, are
obligatory when a cardinal numeral is used, except for a few common cases such as an (ge)
we ‘they two’, where the classifiers are sometimes elided due to common usage. Some
examples of the use of cardinal numbers are seen in examples 5.159 to 5.162 below.
Cardinal numerals are listed in Table 3.8.
   5.159     weubam      bo     at
             pineapple cl       four
             four pineapples
   5.160     dem        gwes mufit
             bamboo CL         seven
             seven sticks of bamboo
   5.161    jam sem is m usyu we
            cassava cl ten        two
            twenty cassava tubers
   5.162     ye      ge gri
             people CL three
             three people


5.7 Complex phrases
   Complex phrases consist of two basic types, coordination and apposition.
   Regarding the first of these, coordination, all languages possess strategies that permit
various types of coordination to occur at the phrasal and sentential level, thereby forming
complex phrases and sentences. According to Payne (1985a:3), there are “five basic co­
ordination types which are realised linguistically both at phrasal and sentential levels:
conjunction (p and q), postsection (p and not q), presection (not p and q), disjunction (p or q)
and rejection (not p and not q; not p or q)”.
   Payne (1985a:3) claims that most languages treat postsection, presection and rejection
analytically as a combination of conjunction and negation, or disjunction and negation; that is,
94                                                                                                           CHAPTER 5


there is no distinct synthetic form. Abun also treats these three types of coordination
analytically. Therefore only conjunction and disjunction are distinct categories in Abun.
   The second basic type of complex phrase is that of apposition. Since this is structurally the
same as one type of coordination (simple juxtaposition), it will be discussed under that
section.
   Table 5.5 following summarises each complex noun phrase type and structure that will be
discussed below.

5.7.1 Conjunction
   There are five different strategies used to conjoin phrases and sentences listed by Payne
(1985a:25—37), consisting of the use of simple juxtaposition (he calls the ‘zero’ strategy),
‘and’, ‘with’, ‘pronoun’ and ‘dual’ strategies. Abun employs the first three types of strategies
to conjoin phrases and sentences.
    In s im p le ju x ta p o s itio n , there are no markers of conjunction. Juxtaposition is a normal
alternative existing alongside other strategies. This strategy is permitted at all levels from
sentence to noun phrase, as well as in verb phrases (verb phrases, incidentally, only allow
this type of strategy to give what appear to be serial verb formations). Examples are:

(i) Sentence:
     5.163    Ye          kw am                  ye          gu                    an.
              people hit.with.instr people hit.with.hand 3sg
              They were hitting with a stick and (they were) punching him.

(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
     5.164    Ye          ma     k a g it    P ef     k a g it    B am ogw em        k a g it    B ik a r.
              people come from Pef from Bamogwem                                     from        Bikar
              They came from Pef, Bamogwem and Bikar.

(iii) Noun Phrase:
     5.165    An     bi        nggon        nggon       yi         dom   an         ro t        nde.

PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                               95

(iv) Verb Phrase:
   5.166     An kas mu sem           mo nden.
             3sg run go sleep loc bush
             He ran and went and slept in the bush.
   5.167     Ye-suk-mise     ma     nai     gwat an mu ket.
             PERS-NOM-evil   come capture take 3so go west
             The police came and caught him and took him westward.
    Apposition, where the two heads involved stand in a mutually attributive relationship (that
is, each head is at the same time an attribute of the other head), is a special case of this
unmarked type of coordination. Alternatively, when the heads are single nouns, as in
examples 5.168 and 5.169, they may be analysed as a single noun phrase, as discussed in
§5.2.1 above. Thus an apposition noun phrase in Abun has the structure of np + np. Two or
more noun phrases are juxtaposed. For example:
   5.168     Men ye-nden      git nggruk     tide.
             I pl PERS-bush eat turtle        neg
             We, ‘Bush’ people must not eat turtle.
   5.169     Ye      ne ye-su-go-te              ye-Waropen.
             person det PERS-head-hair-black PERS-Waropen
             That person is a Papuan, a Waropen.
   5.170    Ji   bi     nji      ye-guru         mo nden kwop re.
            lSG POSS brother PERS-teacher LOC bush die        perf
            My brother, the inland teacher, has died.
  With recursive apposition, the head of the noun phrase is repeated, as in example 5.171.
By way of contrast, in the case where a subsequent noun phrase modifies the first using the
noun modifying particle to, the head of the phrase is not repeated, as in 5.172.
  5.171     An     it     san      be,          san mo sem        ne    san
            3sg    put.on clothes new        clothes LOC sea      det   clothes
            to-re    san     pis.
            EXT-this clothes wrap.around
            She put on new clothes, modem clothes, these clothes, wrap-around clothes.
   5.172     Wo suk-fo          to ndam syor              ne yo,        nu-we      git nde.

             But a forbidden thing, that is that cassowary, you two can not eat.
   In the ‘and’ strategy, the coordinating particle e is used as a conjunction in sentences and
phrases. In the case of noun phrases the form is:

                                      [np e ] n np e
   There is no distinction in meaning between the use of this particle and simple
juxtaposition. Therefore examples are found in sentences, prepositional phrases and noun
phrases similar to those examples given above. In all cases e may be added between the noun
phrases, but may not be added for verb phrases. This particle is widely used and conjoins

respectively. Topicalised objects may also include complex phrases conjoined by e, as in
example 5.175.

     5.175     Mbos e        ndabu e ndam ga     sye ne e                    an

                forbidden all
                Pigeons, doves and birds that are big, they are all forbidden (for women to eat).
  The 'with’ strategy is widely used to conjoin noun phrases. It is rarely used in sentences
and is not permitted in prepositional phrase constructions. Payne points out that this is a very
common strategy and that usually the coordinating particle is identical to the adposition
marking the associative sense of ‘with’ (1985a:29). This is not quite true for Abun, where the
coordinating particle is si ‘with’, while the associative preposition is su ‘with’; the two forms
nevertheless appearing cognate.
     The ‘with’ strategy is evident in Abun coordinate noun phrases in either of two ways:
     1.   [np si] n NP
     5.176     Ji si     Dina si   Yulius si   Isak, men               ma   nyim        mo
               I sg with Dina with Yulius with Isak I pl               come ahead       LOC
               nu       re.
               house PERF
               1 .1 with Dina and with Yulius and with Isak, we had come ahead to the house.
               2. Dina and Yulius and Isak and I, we (all) had come ahead (of the others) to
                 the house.
     2.   NP n si   np

     5.177     Apner, Fredik si     Musa git sugit.
               Apner Fredik with Musa eat food
               Apner, Fredik and Musa ate food (together).
  The former type is more emphatic than the latter in much the same way as in English
where ‘and’ can be repeated, as illustrated in the second translation of example 5.176 above.
    A slightly hybrid version of these two types is seen in example 5.178 below. This is due
to the use of the first person sentence-initially. In Abun, the first person is mentioned first in
a list of persons; that is, an Abun speaker normally refers to himself first.
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                             97

   5.178     Ji si     Adolof Senderina Erlendsi Yususina si
             I sg with Adolof Senderina Erlendsi Yususina with

             [We went to process sago at the river] I with Adolof, Senderina, Erlendsi,
             Yususina and with Mrs Barbarina.
   It should be noted that it is possible for the conjuncts to be split around the predicate to
form: n p p r e d si n p , where the second phrase could be analysed as a si (associative)
prepositional phrase (discussed in §5.4.3). Note that the meaning of both examples 5.177 and
5.179 is similar; however, the former construction is much more common. (Payne
1985a:32) indicates that this split of conjuncts occurs in other languages, such as Russian.
   5.179     Apiier git sugit     si       Fredik si    Musa.
             Apner eat food       with     Fredik with Musa
             Apner ate food together with Fredik and Musa.
   The ‘with’ strategy is not only used for joining phrases where the head is a name or a
pronoun, but also where the head is another type of noun, a noun phrase or a possessive
phrase, such as in the following examples:
   5.180     Suk    sato sukom          si bok     si barisyan an                git sore.
             things like vegetables with salt           with chilli       3pl eat only
             Only things like vegetables with salt and with chilli they can eat.
   5.181     Men   kadum     Syunsom si      ef     Um.
             I pl  point.out Syunsom with    island Um
             We pointed out Syumsom and Um island.
   5.182     Rahel si bi         im        si     bi     ai         mu    re.
             Rachel with POSS mother with poss father               go    perf
             Rachel and her mother and father had already gone.
   The ‘with’ strategy is limited to the conjoining of noun phrases and, in some rare cases, in
the joining of clauses with a common subject. The following example, where two clauses are
joined, comes from a text where the speaker is giving advice on what children with diarrhea
should not do.
   5.183     Pa    da     gur       bo    dek    rom si         git i-ka     nde.
             child drink coconut CL young liquid with eat its-flesh neg
             1. Children must not drink young coconut milk together with eating its flesh.
             2. Don’t drink young coconut milk and eat its flesh.
   There appears to be no limit to how many phrases can be joined by si ‘with’ (or e ‘and’).
One recorded example has a list of nine places that Isak pointed out to the author of the story:
"Isak kadum Joky a, Syugai, Syurgwem, Syukwo, Somsibo, Weyos, Bangkui, Bangkwau si
Wai is ji". This utterance used the pause much like English and concluded with si ‘with’
before the final place name.
  The use of the ‘with’ strategy is more common with coordinate phrases in subject
position. This is because subjects are mostly agents. On the other hand, use of e is more
98                                                                                      CHAPTER 5


common with coordinate phrases in object position, although there are exceptions as seen in
example 5.173.
   Semantically there are some restrictions on the use of the ‘with’ strategy. The conjuncts
must be seen as acting together, as in example 5.182 where Rachel and her parents went
together. If they went separately, the speaker would use the ‘and’ strategy. Also, to employ
the ‘with’ strategy, the conjuncts could be seen as being located close together. Thus in 5.181,
the island and Syunsom were seen together or pointed out together, and so si was used. Also
in 5.180, the items spoken about are of the same type, in the sense that vegetables are eaten
together with either or both of salt and chilli. If, however, these items were in a list and not
necessarily eaten together then e would be used, as in 5.174, where different food items that
would not be eaten together are listed.
   There are times when si and not e must be used. In example 5.184, the use of si means
that the clothes mentioned are actually in the bags. If the clothes were separate from the bags
then e would be more appropriate than si. The use of si therefore implies a togetherness
much more so than the use of e.
     5.184    Pa    pe       yu si        san          e     sukmwa ne.
              child carry bag with clothes and many.things det
              The children carried the bags with clothes and the many (other) things.
    In example 5.185, for example, Apner, Markus and RK are not together when the speaker
refers to them. They are in different locations and are being spoken about at different points
in time. Therefore since there is no ‘togetherness’, e is more appropriate.
     5.185    An     nuk       Apner e        Markus          e     RK e.
              3sg spoke.about  Apner and      Markus          and   RK and
              She spoke about Apner, Markus and RK.
   In summary, of the three strategies used for conjunction, namely juxtaposition, ‘and’ and
‘with’, there is a strengthening of coordination from one to the next; that is, the first is more a
general grouping of items, while the last is more a specific linking of items.


5.7.2 D isjunction
   According to Payne (1985a:40), the majority of languages appear to possess at least one
unequivocal strategy for disjunction, and this is invariably permitted at sentential and phrasal
levels. This is true in Abun. The basic structure for disjunction is for the speaker to follow
each phrase or sentence with the word, bado. In Abun, disjunct phrases consist of: np bado np
bado and so on. The form bado is the alternative conjunction.
     Examples of the use of bado from sentence to phrase level are:

(i) Sentence:
     5.186    Pa    yo ki       nai    bado Ester mu        mo      Barbarina      ete
              child det say     to     or   Ester go        loc     Barbarina      and.then
              ma      bado...
              come or
              A child told (them) or Ester went to Barbarina and came (with the answer)...
PHRASE STRUCTURE                                                                            99


(ii) Prepositional Phrase:
   5.187     Pa ne        mo nu        bado mo nggwe           bado.
             child det LOC house or            loc garden      or
             The child is at home or in the garden.

(iii) Possessive Phrase:
   5.188     Barbarina     titi mu   kem     mo gato Yulius bi              nu      ne    ti
             Barbarina     flee go   stay    LOC rel Yulius poss            house   det   sea

             or     Obet poss house own or
             Barbarina fled and stayed at Yulius’ house at the sea or Obet’s house...

(iv) Noun Phrases:
   5.189    An so       pa       re    tepsu jo t bado        kokor      bado.
            3sg sell child this like           pig or         chicken    or
            He sold the child like a pig or a chicken.
   5.190    Erensi nai       mbre toba      re     sak         we      bado sak
            Erensi took      cloth toba     this   handspan    two     or   handspan
            gri    bado sak           at     bado.
            three or       handspan four or
            Erensi took the toba cloth, (it was) two or three or four handspans.
   Payne (1985a:40) also points out that in certain environments the distinction between
‘and’ and ‘or’ (when the latter is indifferent in the choice between the elements) may be a
minimal one. For example, in example 5.174 above, an alternative translation would be, ‘Eat
animals such as wild pigs (or), kangaroos (or), tree kangaroos or the like’. Likewise, there is
some merging of ‘and’ and ‘or’ in examples 5.165 and 5.175. On the other hand, examples
5.173 and 5.185 may not be translated as ‘or’, but must only be ‘and’.
  Juxtaposition is sometimes used as an alternative to bado. It is particularly evident when
quantifiers are used in noun phrases, such as in example 5.191.
   5.191    mbre dik yo we yo
            cloth one a two a
            one or two cloths
   Other alternatives to bado, that are frequently used as alternative conjunctions in spoken
Abun, are ke and ka. These come from Biak and Indonesian respectively, the latter being a
corruption of the yes/no question particle, kah. This has come about because bado is used in
asking alternative or tag questions, as in ‘An ma, bado, (nde e)?’ ‘He has come or (not)?’
Frequently nde e is omitted, so the alternative conjunction may also act like a yes/no
interrogative particle. Thus Abun speakers have adopted the Indonesian, kah, and use that
just as they use their own, bado\ that is, as an alternative conjunction and in alternative
questions, even though in Indonesian kah is only a yes/no question marker and not an
alternative conjunction. The alternative conjunction in Indonesian is atau, which also is
sometimes borrowed by Abun speakers. Examples are:

                                      MARKED MOODS



    There are three moods which are marked in Abun, namely interrogative, imperative and
frustrated action. Mood is marked by a clause-final particle which follows other particles (that
is, those that mark negation, aspect and modality). Each marked mood will be discussed in
turn.


6.1 Interrogattvemood
   Interrogative mood, like other moods in Abun, uses particles. Two particles are used to
bracket or delineate the constituent being interrogated. The pattern of bracketing a
grammatical constituent by particles is a feature of the Abun language. It is used in negation
(see §8.2), and also in relative clauses, both restricted and unrestricted, as discussed in §9.
  The basic structure of an interrogative sentence in Abun is:
                                         IQM clause FQM
   The optional particle te (referred to as iqm ‘Initial Question Marker’) and another particle
called fqm ‘Final Question Marker’ bracket the clause in question. For all question types te is
the iqm, but the particle fqm varies according to the type of question being asked.
   The initial particle te, although now apparently totally optional, may well have been an
obligatory part of interrogative structures in the past, before the influence of the national
language, Indonesian. This is borne out by the fact that those less influenced by the national
language, from interior villages, use te much more than those on the coast, where the effects
of the national language are more prevalent.
   As a general rule, the pattern of intonation in interrogative sentences is a final falling
contour. The exception is confirmative questions which have a final rising intonation.
   All interrogatives are seeking some type of information. On lexical grounds, namely the
variation in the fqm particle, it is apparent that Abun has four basic types of interrogatives.
The four types are the:
   •   yes/ no   (or nexus) question, one that seeks a comment on the truth of a proposition;
   •   confirmative question,    that seeks agreement, or confirmation from the addressee;
   •   alternative question,  which provides a list of possibilities from which the
       addressee selects an answer;
   •   information or question word question, which seeks particular information such
       as ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘how’, ‘why’, ‘when’ and ‘where’.

6.1.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   There are many characteristics that distinguish yes/no questions from other structures in
the world’s languages. Characteristics listed by Sadock and Zwicky (1985:181) in order of
frequency in their sample were: rising final intonation contour, a sentence-initial particle, a
sentence-final particle, special verb morphology and word order. Abun yes/no questions are
marked with an optional sentence-initial particle and an obigatory sentence-final particle.
   The structure of a yes/ no question in Abun is:
                                          (te)   clause e

  The Yes/No Question Marker e is always used in yes/no questions. However, the ‘Initial
Question Marker’ te is always optional and more often than not is omitted. Of those yes/no
questions studied, about 35% used te. Examples 6.1 and 6.2 illustrate typical yes/no
questions, showing that with or without te the meaning is the same.
   6.1 a.    Te   nan kra     it          e?
             IQM 2sg marry cam            ynqm
             Are you married?
        b.   Nan kra      it e?
             2sg marry cam ynqm
             Are you married?
   6.2 a.    Te   nan nai nan bi                 suk        it     e?
             iqm  2sg get 2sg poss               things     cam    ynqm
             Have you got your things?
        b.   Nan nai nan bi         suk           it        e?
             2sg get 2sg poss things              cam       ynqm
             Have you got your things?
    One of the most striking characteristics of yes/no questions noted by researchers is a
rising-final intonation contour (Sadock & Zwicky 1985:181). An analysis of the intonation
patterns in Abun yes/no questions reveals the opposite, that is a falling final intonation
contour. The intonation pattern for interrogative sentences is the same as that for indicative
sentences. Therefore intonation is not such a significant distinguishing feature of yes/no
questions in Abun as it is in many other languages. Ultan (1978:230) points out that in his
79-language sample, those languages that had prepositions always had a rising terminal
MARKED MOODS                                                                                103

contour intonation pattern. Abun is clearly an exception to this (see Figures 6.1 and 6.2 below
which contrast yes/no and confirmative question intonation patterns).
   There are three basic systems for short answers to yes/no questions: yes/no,
agree/disagree and echo systems. Abun speakers use a mixture of these systems: an echo
system for positive responses; and a negative particle, nde, for negative responses. They do
not have both positive and negative particles for answering like the English ‘yes’ and ‘no’,
but rather they only have the negative particle. When a question such as that in example 6.3 is
asked, a positive answer would be the echo, ‘There is cooked food’. Frequently such answers
may be shortened even further, a possible response to 6.3 being mo ‘there is’. A negative
response would require the use of nde ‘no’.
   6.3       A     kon   suk    a           yo   jon    e?
             2sg cook thing pause           some cooked ynqm
             Have you cooked anything?
   Although Abun speakers use an echo system for positive responses, their body-language
responses to yes/no questions uses a yes/no system. Raising of the eyebrows means ‘yes’,
and turning up of their nose means ‘no’.


6.1.2 Confirmative questions
   This type of question asks for confirmation of a presumed situation. The structure is:
                                         {te) CLAUSEf e
   Such constructions are very similar to yes/no questions, but they have a rising final
intonation contour and use the marker fe ‘Confirmative Question Marker, c q m ’ sentence-
finally, as in examples 6.4 and 6.5.
   6.4       Te    ji    bi      suk      ane   fe?
             iqm    Iso poss thing        dem    cqm
             That’s mine! Right?

             good    CQM
             1. That’s good! Right?
             2. That’s good, isn’t it?
   These questions presume a positive response and may also be called positively biased
yes/no questions. Negatively biased yes/no questions, such as in example 6.6, are
unacceptable to an Abun speaker.
  6.6       *Ndar anane nde fe?
            dog DET          NEG    CQM
            That’s not a dog, right?
   Confirmative questions not only have a distinct fqm, but are also distinguished from
yes/no questions by a rising final intonation contour. Example 6.7 has the intonation pattern
as shown in Figure 6.1, which contrasts with the intonation pattern for the yes/no question of
6.8, shown in Figure 6.2 below.

6.1.3 Alternative questions
   In an alternative question, two or more possibilities are presented by the speaker.
Combinations include two possibilities such as, ‘Do you want to go, or not?’, where the
alternative is a positive or negative reply; or ‘Do you want a banana, or a coconut?’, where
the alternative is between two items. Another possibility is where one alternative is specified
and the second alternative seeks information such as, “Is the palm wine sweet, or what?”
Also more extensive lists of alternative items are possible.
  For an alternative question where there are two alternatives, the structure is:
                                 (ie)   clause b a d o clause   e
  Example 6.9 illustrates two alternatives:
MARKED MOODS                                                                                105

   6.9       A    kra     M oses bado a       bari           e?
             2sg marry Moses aqm         2sg do.not.want ynqm
             Do you want to marry Moses, or don’t you want to?
    Instead of having a number of varied alternatives, a further possibility is to have just two
alternatives, one being the negation of the other. In these cases the first alternative (which is
positive) is followed by bado, while the second alternative is the negative particle, nde,
followed by the yes/no question marker, e. Thus the structure of a positive-negative
alternative question is:
                                    (re) clause bado nde e
   Example 6.10 illustrates this type of question.
   6.10      Te   men fro t        an      bado, nde e?
             iqm  I pl     inform 3pl      aqm      neg    ynqm
             Will we tell them or not?
  This form is often shortened by the ellipsis of nde e resulting in a form like that of yes/no
questions, but with a different fqm, that is bado. Such a form, as in example 6.11, is still a
positive/negative alternative question. It has the same meaning as if nde e was present.
   6.11      A    jam    nadi, bado?
             2sg know pray aqm
             Do you know how to pray (or not)?
   This type of construction could be called a truncated positive-negative alternative question.
The addition of nde e makes the question more forceful and is used in cases where a
question, like that in example 6.11, is ignored or not answered quickly enough, so the
speaker would reiterate the question with nde e in addition to bado.
   A further variation of the type of alternative question is one where the final alternative
seeks information. The final clause follows the same structure as information-seeking
questions, discussed in §6.1.4. Example 6.12 illustrates this type, where the last alternative is
actually an information-seeking question, and uses the particle ne as fqm.
   6.12      Nau         ne w ik              bado sa             u       ne?
             palm.wine DET good.tasting aqm like                  which   fqm
             Does that palm wine taste good, or what?
   Regarding intonation in alternative questions, Abun has a falling final intonation contour
on bado in much the same way as intonation falls in yes/no questions as well as indicative
sentences.
   No matter what type of alternative question is asked, the syntax is the same, that is the
‘Alternative Question Marker’ (aqm), bado, follows each alternative. The final alternative is
followed by its relevant QM, usually the yes/no question marker, except for cases where it is
one seeking information. The ‘Initial Question Marker’ (iqm) is optionally present, as for
other question types. The structure of an alternative question (where n + 1= the number of
alternatives) is:

                                [(te)   clause   bado ]n   clause   e
106                                                                                  CHAPTER 6


   In example 6.13 there are four alternatives. Each one, except the last, is followed by bado.
This means that the clause which precedes it is in question as a possible alternative and every
clause in an alternative question must be followed by bado. The comma before bado and the
semicolon after it represent a pause and a longer pause respectively.
   6.13      Be     nggon    gato       syimfar ne te         mu    ben suk   mo nggwe
             will   girl     who        pregnant dem iqm      go    do things at garden
             dom, bado; mu os             syu dom, bado; sam suk      de    dom, bado;
             also aqm go path            long also aqm   carry things heavy also aqm
             an    kem      mo nusore etejo an        i             nu,    e?
             she stay at homeonly then she sweeps                   house yn<>i
             When a woman is pregnant does she also go to the garden, does she go on
             long trips too, does she carry heavy things too, or does she just stay at home
             and sweep the house?


6.1.4 Information-seeking questions
   Questions seeking information, such as those asking ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘how’, ‘why’, ‘when’
and ‘where’, are all formed in Abun in a similar way. They follow the general bracketing
pattern that is evident in negation. A question of this type is formed by using two particles or
markers: te (always optional) at the start of the sentence and fqm at the end. An interrogative
proform is also used in conjunction with these markers. This is a rare combination according
to Sadock and Zwicky (1985:183), who say that inversion and special morphology
frequently co-occur with interrogative words, whereas particles and contrastive intonation do
not.
   The structure of information-seeking interrogative sentences in Abun is:
                                 {te)    s v o   adjunct ( q) fqm

where fqm is a ‘Final Question Marker’ and (q) represents a single interrogative word which
may follow one of either the subject, the verb, the object or the adjuncts, depending upon
which constituent is being interrogated. Exceptions to this pattern occur when information
seeking-interrogative sentences are topicalised, as in example 6.14. This pattern is discussed
in detail in §6.1.4.4.
   6.14      Ben sa       u       anato nan yo ma      more nde ne?
             do    like which foc         2sg neg come here neg fqm
             1. How is it that you didn’t come here?
             2. Why didn’t you come here?
   Regarding the initial marker, te, in a sample of 194 questions in text material te occurred
41 times, that is about 21% of information-seeking questions use te. Therefore questions like
that in example 6.15 are without the iqm and are more common than those with te.
   6.15      Ji   bi     suma is nan o?
             lsc give what io 2sg fqm
             1. What can I give to you?
             2. How can I help you?
MARKED MOODS                                                                                   107

   The final question marker (fqm) is either ne or o. The use of either one of these particles is
obligatory. The particles ne and o are used interchangeably, with no change in meaning. So
example 6.16a has the same meaning as 6.16b. These two particles appear to have been
originally dialectal variants which have now been incorporated into all dialects. There is no
apparent difference in meaning; ne is more common than o, occurring in 90% of all
questions analysed.
   6.16 a. Nan ja n    suma n e ?
           2sg plant what fqm
           What did you plant?
          b. Nan ja n    suma o ?
             2sg plant what fqm
             What did you plant?
   Both particles (te...ne/o) bracket the whole sentence irrespective of its complexity. In a
complex sentence as in example 6.17, two clauses are embedded: a relative clause and a
dependent purpose clause. Both are bracketed by the initial and final particles.
   6.17      Te ye         gato i      ne git s u m a sube           an   ge 6 ne?
             iq m person rel sick det eat what so.that 3pl well again fqm
             1. People who are sick eat what so they will get well again?
             2. What do sick people eat so they will get well again?
   Information-seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to yes/no and
alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be expected according to the
findings by Ultan (1978:230), where he points out that information questions have a
considerably better-than-chance probability of having a rising terminal contour.
   The question word follows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In example
6.18, the subject, that is ‘the person who came’, is the focus of interrogation; whereas in 6.19
the object, that is ‘the types of plants’, is the focus of interrogation. In 6.20 the location is the
focus of interrogation, and in 6.21 the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.
   6.18      Te je        u   ma   more ne?
             Iqm person which come here fqm
             Who came here?
   6.19      Te   nan jan       s u k -ja n u ne?
             Iqm 2sg plant NOM-plant which fqm
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.20      Nan grem buku ne          mo u ne?
             2 sg put    book dem doc which fqm
             Where did you put the book?
   6.21      Te   an    syo buku ne            nai j e         u         ne?
             iqm 3sg give book dem             io  person      which    FQM
             Who did he give the book to?
   With regard to the interrogative proforms used in information-seeking questions, Abun
has only three. According to Sadock and Zwicky (1985:184), theoretically it should be
possible that only one single morpheme, glossed as ‘what’, is needed. Therefore, all
108                                                                               CHAPTER 6


information questions would involve periphrasis (that is, ‘what person’ for who, ‘what place’
for where, and so on). However, in practice the smallest system known to them is the
Yokuts system with three interrogative words. Abun can therefore be added as one of the
smallest systems known. The three proforms are:

             suma           what              general interrogative
             u              which              specific interrogative
             ot             how many          pronumeral interrogative

  Table 6.2 shows each interrogative word and its periphrasis together with the equivalent
question words in English.
   Abun is even more unusual than Yokuts, not having a distinct interrogative proform that
makes a distinction between personal and impersonal (‘who’ and ‘what’ in English). Ultan
(1978:229) points out that this contrast is almost always present. But instead Abun forms the
pronominal interrogative, ‘who’, by a combination of je ‘person’ and u ‘which’.
  Each interrogative word with examples of various question types is discussed below.

6 . 1.4.1   U   QUESTIONS

   The most widely used interrogative word is u. It is used to form the following types of
interrogatives.




7     See §3.4.1 for a list of classifiers and the types of nouns to which they apply.
110                                                                               CHAPTER 6


(i) who
   U forms questions inquiring about the identity of a person, who may be either subject, as
in example 6.22, object, 6.23, or accompaniment, 6.24, in a sentence.
  6.22       Je     u       ma mo-re              ne?
             person which come Loc-here           FQM
             Who came here?
  6.23       Ndar ne jau je        u              ne?
             dog det bite person which            FQM
             Who did the dog bite?
  6.24       Nan kem su je              u         ne?
             2sg live with person       which     FQM
             Who do you live with?

(ii) whose
   Examples 6.25 and 6.26 illustrate questions inquiring about the possession of a dog and
pig respectively.
  6.25       Je       u         ana bi        ndar     ne     ne?
             person which foc poss dog                 dem    fqm
             1. Who is it that owns that dog?
             2. Whose dog is that?
  6.26       Nan gu j e          u         bi        jo t    ne?
             2sg kill person which         poss      pig     fqm
             Whose pig did you kill?

(iii) which/whatx
   The following examples illustrate the use of u in asking questions about the identity of a
particular thing, such as what type of fish in example 6.27, or what type of plants in 6.28.
  6.27       Nan sok boge u               ne?
             2sg fish fish which          fqm
             What type of fish do you fish for?
  6.28       Suk-jan    u       kom ndo ne?
             NOM-plant which grow well fqm
             Which plants are growing well?

(iv) how, what
  Questions that ask about the state of something, (like a name as in example 6.29, or a
body size as in 6.30), and questions that ask about the manner in which something is to be
done (6.31 and 6.32), all use sa u ‘like which’.
  6.29       Nan gum sa u                 ne?
             2sg name like which          fqm

             What is your dog like?
   6.31      Nan jan     weu      sa   u ne?
             2sg plant banana like which fqm
             How do you plant bananas?
   6.32      An git an bi          sugit       i         sa     u          ne?

             How does he eat his food?
   Questions inquiring into what type of actions someone has done, (example 6.33) or will
do in the future (6.34) use ben sa u ‘do like what’. There is an overlap in the use of suma and
u in these types of questions. In both cases below, suma could replace u and be syntactically
correct. However when suma is used the answer sought would be more general in nature,
consistent with the differentiation between these two interrogative words explained above.
   6.33      Kamekre nggon       ne    ben s a u                     ne?
             yesterday women dem do like which                       fqm
             What did the women do yesterday?
  6.34      Mo-re       ye     ben     sa   u     sube              yo  ku       suki
            LOC-here    people do      like which so.that           NEG get      sickness

            mosquito NEG FQM
            What do people here do so that they won’t get malaria?

(v) where, from where, which direction
   For questions regarding location, source or direction the appropriate preposition is used
together with u. So for location, mo u means ‘where’ in example 6.35; source, kagit u ‘from
where’ as in 6.36 and direction, ket u ‘which direction’ as in 6.37.
  6.35      Nan ontu            mo         u         ne?
            2sg umbilical.cord loc         which     fqm
            Where were you bom?

            woman evil     go way which FQM
            Which way did the evil woman go?

(vi) why
   Another type of question asked using u is questions that inquire as to the reason for a
particular action, or inaction, as in example 6.38.
112                                                                                CHAPTER 6


   6.38      Te  nan fow a         suk      ne wa sa        u      ne?
             iqm2sg forbidden thing that for like           which fqm
             Why are you forbidden (to eat) that?

(vii) when
  Questions asking about time usually use the interrogative pronumeral, of, however, when
one is asked to specify the name of the day or month u can be used, as in example 6.39.
   6.39       Kam u       ete nan mu         ne?
             day which then 2sg go           fqm
             When will you be going?


6.1.4.2 suma questions
   The interrogative word, suma, is used to form questions inquiring about the identity of
something, as in example 6.40, the nature of a particular action, as in 6.41, the reason for a
particular action, as in 6.42, or its topicalisation, as in 6.43.

(i) w hat
   6.40      Nan sok sum a ne?
             2sg fish what fqm
             What do you fish for?
   6.41      An ben sum a o?
             3sg do    what fqm
             What did he do?

(ii) why
   6.42      Nan yo     ma     more nde wa sum a
             2sg neg come here nbg for what
             Why didn’t you come here?

(iii) why (topicalised)
   6.43      Sum a ben anato nan yo          ma       more nde ne?
             what do foc         2sg neg come here           neg fqm
             1. What was the reason that you didn’t come here?
             2. Why was it that you didn’t come?
  The distinction between u and suma is one of specific and general. U is more specific than
suma. Consider examples 6.44 and 6.45 below.
   6.44      Nan jan     suk-jan      u  ne?
             2sg plant NOM-plant which fqm
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.45      Nan jan      suma ne?
             2sg plant what fqm
             What did you plant?
MARKED MOODS                                                                              113

   Example 6.44 is looking for a more specific answer than 6.45. We may get an answer like
com, cassava and tomatoes; whereas the answer to the second question may be something
more general, like vegetables. Often the answer may not be different, but the question in
example 6.45 is more likely to result in a less specific answer.
  Suma is limited in its use as an interrogative word to asking questions such as ‘what’ or
‘why’. However u is more widely used and is involved in periphrasis to form most types of
questions, such as ‘who’, ‘whose’, ‘what’, ‘which’, ‘where’, ‘why’, ‘how’ and ‘when’.
  The third interrogative word, ot ‘how many’, is used in forming questions relating to
quantity and time, that is, ‘when’ and ‘how many’.


6.1.4.3 Ot QUESTIONS
   The interrogative pronumeral ot is used to form questions about time and quantity. There
is some overlap of u and ot in asking time questions. Compare example 6.46 below with
6.39 above. The difference is that in 6.39 the answer would be expected to name a day,
month or other point in time, such as next year; whereas 6.46 would expect an answer such
as ‘in five days’ or ‘three months’, that is with some type of numerical response.
   6.46      Kam ot            ete   nan       mu    ne?
             day how.many then 2sg             go    FQM
             When will you be going?
   There are no tense markers on verbs in Abun, so whether a time question (such as in
example 6.47) is in the past or future is determined by reference to the context, or by the
special use of the word ete ‘then’, (as in 6.46) or be ‘later’ (as in 6.48) to indicate future
time.

(i) when
   6.47     An ma       more su      kam ot              ne?
            3sg come here with day           how.many fqm
            When did he come here? (lit. how many days ago)
   6.48     Be an      ma    more su kam          ot              ne?
            later 3 sg come herewith day         how.many         fqm
            When will he come here?

(ii) how many
   To ask about the duration of some event, kom mo is used instead of su, as in example
6.49.
  6.49      Nan kem more kom mo kam ot                           ne?
            2sg live here for        to   day how.many            fqm
            How long have you lived here?
   Ot is also used in questions of quantity. In this type, ot follows the noun for a specific
item such as ‘pigs’ or ‘money’ with its appropriate classifier, as in examples 6.50 and 6.51.
See §3.4.1. for a list of classifiers and the types of nouns to which they apply.
114                                                                                  CHAPTER 6


  6.50      Nan bi     jot ge       ot                ne?
            2sg poss pig body how.many                 fqm
            How many pigs do you have?
  6.51       Nan bi     nu     ke   ot    ne?
             2sg poss house base how.many fqm
             How many houses do you have?
  The word warn ‘times’ does not require a classifier, as in examples 6.52 and 6.53.
  6.52       Te nan i      su    suk-i     sunggu             ne      want ot           ne?
             iqm2sg sick with NOM-sick mosquito               dem     times how.many     fqm
             How many times have you had malaria?
  6.53       Nan mu warn ot               mo Dom                   ne?
             2sg go    times how.many loc Sorong                   fqm
             How many times have you gone to Sorong?


6.1.4.4 Topicalisation of information-seeking questions
   Information-seeking questions, like indicative sentences, can be topicalised (see §4.7.2). In
these forms the question word is followed by the demonstrative-focus word (or topicaliser),
anato, as in example 6.54. The use of this form brings sukjan ‘plants’ into greater focus or
emphasis than the non-topicalised forms, as in 6.55 and 6.56.
   6.54      Te suk-jan        u        anato     nan jan          ne?
             IQM NOM-plant     which foc          2sg plant        fqm
             Which plants are the ones that you planted?
   6.55      Te  nan jan       suk-jan        u        ne?
             iqm 2sg plant NOM-plant          which    fqm
             Which plants did you plant?
   6.56      Nan jan      suma ne?
             2sg plant what fqm
             What did you plant?
   In a sample of 127 information-seeking questions, 25% were topicalised.
   In Abun the constituents of a sentence that may be topicalised in questions are the subject.
Even though the subject is the topic, it may receive extra focus by the use of anato, as in
example 6.57 and object, as in 6.54.
   6.57      Te je        u        anato      ndar    ne     jau ne?
             iqm person which FOC             dog     det     bite fqm
             Who was it that the dog bit?
   Other constituents such as location in example 6.58 cannot be topicalised.
   6.58      *Mo u           anato    nan ontu                 ne?
             loc which       foc      2sg umbilical.cord        fqm
MARKED MOODS                                                                                 115

6.1.5 USAGEOFINTERROGATIVESENTENCES
   Abun has no special form for rhetorical questions. Instead interrogative sentences can be
used in a rhetorical sense; that is, the speaker not only is sure of the answer, but also requires
no answer. So on some occasions, although the structure is interrogative, the illocutionary
force is not. This is plain in narrative texts where the speaker continues after asking a
‘question’ because the answer is obvious. Examples taken from text are:

(i) a negative statement
   6.59      Ji da             sok ari               sarewo Yefun ne      sa u   ne?
             I sg even.though enter church.service but        God dem like which fqm
             1. Even though I went to church, what was God like?
             2. Even though I went to church, I couldn’t understand who God was.
             Ji     yo  bi        OS  wa      ji    kem mo Dom     nde
             lSG    NEC POSS      way for      I sg live in Sorong NBG
             be     je        u        anato mew a       ji    ne?
             later person which FOC            care.for lSG FQM
             1 .1 had no way I could live in Sorong, who could take care of me?
             2 .1 couldn’t live in Sorong because there was no one there who would have
                taken care of me.

(ii) an exclamation expressing surprise or even disgust
             An    jim not ware an           ki    do     “Suma ben j i        anato
             3sg   think   FRIJS 3SG         say   that   what  do   I sg      FOC
            ji      sem    mo       nat   re    e     ji    i    sare      ne ? "
             lSG sleep LOC place this and I sg sick like.this FQM
             1. He thought about it with no success, “What ever made me sleep in this place
               and get sick like this?”
            2. He couldn’t work out what made him sleep in a place like that that made him
               so sick.
   Example 6.61 comes from a narrative, and at this point there was no interaction with
anyone. The speaker was really disgusted with himself for doing such a stupid thing. In
English we often ask ourselves, “Why did I do such a stupid thing?”, in the sense, “What a
stupid thing for me to have done!” So the semantic force of this interrogative structure is not
to ask a question but to make a statement expressing disgust.

(iii) a statement expressing uncertainty
  This example comes from a narrative where the speaker was not interacting with anyone.
  6.62      An    ki     do    “Ye       ne    Yesugote ye        Waropen bado?”
            3sg say that person that Irianese             person Waropen aqm
            1. He said, “Was that Irianese person a Waropen person?”
            2 .1 think he said that the Irianese person was a Waropen person.
116                                                                                  CHAPTER 6


(iv) a rebuke or negative command
  6.63      Nan nok       wa sum a ne?
            2sg afraid for what FQM
            1. Why are you afraid?
            2. Don’t be afraid!
    The above type of interrogative structure is a rhetorical question found in cases where the
speaker continues, not waiting for an answer. In the context of example 6.63, people said
(literally), “Why are you afraid? Go on inside!” In saying this they effectively rebuked the
one who was being slow about doing what he should have done.

(v) a condition
   6.64      Yonatan    bi     ai     ndo   do       “Te more nu    sugit yo
             Yonatan    poss   father asked that     iqm here house food a
            yen bro jam sem yo           bado? Ge          ber men git sore”.
            3pl boil cassava some aqm              then    later I pl eat just
            Yonatan’s father said, “If there is a restaurant here that boils cassava then let’s
            just go and eat there”.


6.2 Imperatives
   Imperative sentences convey a request, command, order, suggestion, instruction or an
entreaty. Sadock and Zwicky (1985:171) note that since human social life so frequently
consists of activities of requesting, commanding and the like, no language (it seems) lacks a
form dedicated to imperative sentences. This is indeed true for Abun.
   First we will make some general typological comments about Abun imperative sentences
in relation to universal observations (§6.2.1). This will be followed by a discussion of the
types of imperative sentences found in Abun consisting of the basic imperative type (§6.2.2),
a group of two types that may be called hortative (§6.2.3), and another type labelled
prohibitive (§6.2.4).


6.2.1 Imperative typology and Abun
   Because the imperative mood is basically connected with the second person and relates to
an action to be performed in the immediate future, the second person pronoun, tense and
aspect distinctions are usually absent because they are implied. For this reason, verbs in the
imperative mood in many languages are in their most basic form. Indeed, Lyons (1977:746)
points out that in many languages imperative sentences are characterised by a change in the
form of the main verb of the sentence to its most simple form. However, in Abun, the form
of the verb is exactly the same as for declarative and interrogative moods. On the other hand,
consistent with most languages, tense and aspect distinctions, which are normally expressed
by adverbs and particles in Abun, are not found in imperative sentences. Instead Abun uses
optional particles to show strength of imperatives. These occur clause-finally.
   According to Sadock and Zwicky (1985:173), the removal of the subject pronoun and/or
verbal concord affix is amazingly common. Abun, however, does not allow the removal of
MARKED MOODS                                                                               117

the subject in imperative sentences. On the contrary, subject is obligatory in all types of Abun
speech acts.
   Sadock and Zwicky (1985:171) also point out that there is considerable diversity in the
way in which imperative sentences are marked, including pre- or post-sentential particles,
verbal clitics, special verb morphology, and intonation. In Abun, imperative sentences may
be marked or simply left unmarked. Marked forms are distinguished by the use of one of
three optional clause-final (or post-sentential) particles. The three markers are seen in Table
6.3 below:
                                 table6.3: imperative markers

                                                  Mild         Strong
                              Positive            et            tom/se
                              Prohibitive                nde


6.2.2 Basic imperative
   The basic imperative in Abun is simply unmarked where the subject of the sentence is
second person, and the established time setting is not in the past (this is normally clear from
the context, as indicated by adverbs, mood or aspect particles, since there are no tense
markers in Abun). The examples below require a certain context to make them imperative
sentences. Without knowing the context there could be several translations. Intonation is the
same as for indicate sentences, but there may be greater force. For example:
   6.65      Nan git        boge mone.
             2sg eat       fish  there
             1. Eat that fish!
             2. You are/were eating fish there.
   6.66      Nan syo     mbre            sak dik is ji.
             2sg give antique.cloth      cl    one 10 lSG
             1. Give me one antique cloth!
             2. You gave one antique cloth to me.
   6.67      Nin ma       mo Syurur kekro.
             2pl come LOC Syurur quickly
             1. Come quickly to Syurur!
             2. You came to Syurur quickly.


6.2.3 Hortative
   Sadock and Zwicky (1985:160) claim that “most languages have an imperative restricted
to second person logical subjects”. To show an exception to this they refer to Onondaga,
which has a general imperative type that occurs in all persons and numbers and covers a wide
range of more specific acts. In labelling such a sentence type, they argue (1985:77) that “The
hortative is in some languages simply a first or third person form of the imperative... We
might say that...(as in Onondaga), there is only a hortative form...”. Abun, likewise, does not
restrict the subject to second person, but also includes other persons; thus we have labelled

the particles et as ‘mild hortative’ and tom/se as ‘strong hortative’.8 Unmarked imperatives
can also be used with first and third person as well as second person, as exemplified below:

(i) first person

      An alternative label that embraces a more general clause type than im perative that could also be
      used here is jussive as suggested by Huddleston (1984:360).

             2. He should kill his dog.

             Tell Yonas that he is to eat food!!
   The unmarked form, et and tom express different degrees of urgency with which the
speaker wants the addressee to perform the act and different degrees of forcefulness. Tom is
a command, where the addressee has no option to refuse, whereas et and the unmarked form
are requests, which allow the addressee more leeway to refuse or to comply more slowly. So
it may be said that the differences between the basic imperative and the mild and strong
hortatives are that of immediacy and intensity, with the force of suggestion, request and
command respectively. Thus in example 6.77a the request (if ascertained to be one from the
context) is not as urgent as in 6.77b; whereas 6.77c demands immediate action of the
addressee. In 6.77d, it is the negative imperative or prohibitive form which is mild to strong,
depending upon intonation.
   6.77 a.   Nan m u      me Sadrak bi        im.
             2sg go       see Sadrak poss mother
             1. Go and see Sadrak’s mother.
             2. You went to see Sadrak’s mother.
          b. Nan m u     me Sadrak bi              im     et!
             2sg go      see Sadrak poss           mother hort(m)
             Go and see Sadrak’s mother!
          c. Nan m u     me Sadrak bi              im     tom!!
             2sg go      see Sadrak poss           mother hort(s)
             Go and see Sadrak’s mother!!
          d. Nan mu me Sadrak bi            im nde!
             2sg    go see Sadrak poss mother neg
             Don’t go and see Sadrak’s mother!


6.2.4 P rohibitive
   The prohibitive form prohibits action; for example, the addressee in the example above is
prohibited from going to see Sadrak’s mother. Compare the commands for action in 6.77a
-c, to the prohibition, using nde, in 6.77d. This example is a negative imperative applying to
the second person.
120                                                                                  CHAPTER 6


   The prohibitive form also encompasses first and third persons, hence the use of the label
‘prohibitive’ rather than ‘negative imperative’. The term prohibitive includes all persons and
numbers in the same way as do requests and commands discussed above. Examples 6.78
and 6.79 show that the meaning can be regulatory or enforcing a prohibition, making clear
this form is not limited to negative imperatives. In these examples the third and first persons
are prohibited respectively. For further discussion see §8.1.1.
   6.78      Nggon git ndam-syor nde.
             Women eat bird-syor      neg
             Women must not eat cassowary.
   6.79      M en git sek         nde.
             I pl eat possum neg
             We must not eat possum.
  The particle nde does not indicate any difference in urgency or force as the positive
imperatives do. Instead nde simply conveys prohibition. It is unacceptable to include the
hortative particles with nde in the following example:
   6.80      *Nan git j i    bi         sugit tom         nde!!
             2sg eat I sg poss          food hort(s)      nbg
             Don’t eat my food!!
   Sadock and Zwicky (1985:175) note that a striking feature of negative imperatives is how
differently they are handled from negative declaratives. They say it is quite unusual for the
marks of negation from other sentence types to be added to the imperative formula. Abun
actually takes one of its negative particles used in declarative sentence types and uses it for
making negative imperatives. Negation in declarative sentences is marked by a linked pair of
particles, yo...nde, whereas for negative imperatives nde alone is used. Compare 6.81a with
6.81b.
   6.81 a. Nan git gur         nde.
           2sg eat coconut neg
           Don’t eat coconuts.
          b. Nan yo git gur                 nde.
             2sg neg eat coconut            neg
             You do not eat coconuts.


6.3 Frustrated action
   Frustrated action is marked by the particle ware, which syntactically occurs in the same
position as other mood markers, that is as the last among a group of clause-final particles.
Thus we have analysed it as a mood. The particle ware could be translated as ‘in vain’, ‘to no
avail’ or ‘but without success’. Its meaning is that an action was attempted but the goal of the
action was not achieved. For example:
   6.82      An      ben     syu-syo        wa nok            ware.
             3sg     make rotan-mouth for wild.pig frus
             1. He   made a trap for wild pigs but he did not trap any.
             2. He   made a trap for wild pigs but to no avail.
MARKED MOODS                                                                             121

   6.83     An      p et     ndam w are, kunus yo             kom nde.
            3sg      shoot bird       frus     arrow neg reach neg
            1. He   shot a bird in vain, his arrow did not reach (it).
            2. He   tried to shoot a bird, but his arrow missed (it).
   Frequently a clause is added following the use of ware as in example 6.83 above to give
further information as to how the action was frustrated. In 6.82, by contrast, we are not sure
how the action was frustrated. It may have been that no pigs passed by the trap, or that when
the trap went off it did not catch a pig.
   Ware, in common with all mood markers, follows aspect and modal particles (such as go
‘assertive’), as seen in the following example:
  6.84      Ji     duwer an mo sor                    ndo     nde go       w are.
            I sg argue      3sg LOC continually       good neg ass frus
            I continually argued with him very much, I really did, but to no avail.

                                ASPECT AND MODALITY




   Two classes of particles that optionally occur immediately preceding any mood particles
are aspect and modality particles. These particles occur in that order.


7.1 Aspect
    The notion of aspect, according to Comrie (1976:1-3), tends to be a less familiar notion to
students of linguistics than other terms for verbal categories. In order to define the term, he
firstly distinguishes it from tense. He points out that “aspects are different ways of viewing
the internal temporal constituency of a situation”. Lyons (1968:315) also distinguishes tense
from aspect by noting that tense has to do with the location in time of an action or state,
whereas aspect has to do with the distribution of time or contour of an action or state. He
claims that the main aspectual notions of ‘completion’ and ‘duration’ are found in many
languages.
    Abun uses particles to express aspectual notions. The notion of ‘completion’ is expressed
by two particles, re and it, while the notion of ‘incompleteness’ is expressed by the particle
to. When these optional particles occur, they follow negative markers, where present, but
precede mood and modality particles.

                                TABLE 7.1: ABUN ASPECT PARTICLES

      Particle         Type                              Definition
       re          perfect           an action or state has or will have occurred, and
                                     has/will have continuing relevance
       it          completive         an action or state is considered finished
       to          incompletive       an action or state is considered incomplete


   The use of clause-final panicles is a unique feature of the Abun language, and is a
particularly unusual way to mark aspect. Foley (1986:143) points out that aspect tends to be
indicated lexically in Papuan languages, most commonly by the use of serial verb
constructions. He also notes that aspect is also frequently indicated in Papuan languages by
bound verbal affixes. However, the possibility of indicating aspect by a clause-final particle,
as in Abun, is not mentioned in his discussion.
   Foley (1986:143) also points out, as do other writers (such as Comrie and Lyons), that
aspect says nothing about the relationship between the time of the event and the time of the

speech act, which tense does. Rather, aspect may describe the distribution of time of an action
or state in the past, present or future.


7.1.1 Perfect aspect
   Re, a totally different morpheme from the determiner re ‘this’, in the absence of any
contextual time reference indicates that an event has taken place. The use of re confirms the
actuality of an event, and implies its continuing present relevance. Such is the definition of
‘perfect’ suggested by Comrie (1976:52). By comparing the examples in 7.1, one can see
that the latter indicates the continuing relevance of the action ‘cut’ to the remainder of the
story. On the other hand, 7.1a says nothing about the continuing relevance of the cut
confirmed by the next sentence of the discourse, which tells of how the storyteller went to see
Moses and of the extent of the cut.
   7.1 a.     Prisila sap M oses syim brot toko.
              Prisila cut Moses hand vein broken
              Prisila cut a vein in Moses’ hand in half.
         b.   Prisila sap M oses syim brot toko              re.
              Prisila cut Moses hand vein broken perf
              Prisila had cut a vein in Moses’ hand in half.
    Again, in example 7.2, Prisila had gone to the mountain and was still there when the next
part of the discourse took place; that is, the use of re indicates the continuing present
relevance of a past situation to the coming events. In a sense it provides the background or
situation in which the coming events occur.
   7.2        An    mu mo banbo           re.
              3 sg  go   loc mountain perf
              She had gone to the mountain.
  The use of the perfect aspect particle is also common with states such as death and
marriage, for example:
   7.3        Pa     ne kwop re.
              child det die       perf
              The child had died.
   7.4        An    kra    Andar bi      im  re.
              3    marry Andar POSS mother perf
                  sg

              He had married Andar’s mother.
   Comrie (1976:56) discusses four different types of perfect: perfect of result, experiential
perfect, perfect of persistent situation and perfect of recent past. He says that not all languages
with forms for perfect meaning have the full range of meaning listed here. In Abun, the
particle re covers the meaning of the first three types of perfect. Example 7.5b is a perfect-of-
result type in that a present state is referred to as being the result of some past situation, as
defined by Comrie (1976:56). In this case it indicates that Fredik is still in Sorong, whereas
7.5a does not necessarily imply that. Normally in unmarked cases, the present time is
implied unless another time is indicated by the context.
124                                                                                            CHAPTER   7

    7.5 a.     Fredik mu        mo Dom.
               Fredik go       loc Sorong
               Fredik went to/is going to Sorong.
          b.   Fredik mu       mo Dom     re.
               Fredik go      loc Sorong perf
               Fredik has gone to Sorong.
          c.   Fredik mu       mo Dom     mo               re.
               Fredik go       loc Sorong loc              perf
               Fredik has been to Sorong.
    A second type of perfect is experiential perfect, which Comrie (1976:58) defines as a
perfect aspect which “indicates that a given situation has held at least once during some time
in the past up to the present”. For this aspect an additional particle, the general locative
preposition mo, directly precedes re. This means that, in example 7.5c for example, Fredik
has been to Sorong at some time (that is, he has experienced going to Sorong), but where he
is now is not under discussion.
   For perfect aspect, Comrie (1976:53) says that it may be present, which expresses a
relation between present state and past situation; past, which expresses a relation between a
past state and an earlier situation: or future, which expresses a relation between a future state
and a situation prior to it. Examples in Abun of present perfect are seen in examples 7.1b and
7.5b. The form of past perfect, however, is expressed only in a complex sentence, where re
occurs with sa, such as in 7.6.
    7.6        Domingos git         mbem       dik    ne         or           re     sa
               Domingas eat         plate      one    det        completely   PERF   when.REAL
               Gerad bi   im       ma.
               Gerad poss mother come
               When Domingas had eaten one plate (of food), Gerad’s mother came.
   The perfect in Abun is understood from the context (so example 7.7 can be in either future
or present time), or may be clarified by the use of temporal phrases, like here in 7.8.
    7.7        Ji     ben j i     bi    nggwe re.
               I sg do       I sg poss garden perf
               1 .1 will have been working in my garden.
               2 .1 had been working in my garden.
    7.8        Ji    mu aina       dik sore here j i          satu     re.
               I sg go     month one only later I sg return perf
               I am only going for one month, then I will have returned.


7.1.2 Completive aspect
   Comrie (1976:18), in discussing perfective aspect,9 makes the comment that very
frequently perfectivity is characterised by completed action. He says that this is not quite


9     This is distinct from perfect aspect as used above. Comrie makes a sharp distinction betw een
      perfect and perfective. The aspects re and it in Abun are similar to what Comrie defines as perfect
      and perfective respectively, but the latter is slightly different from perfective in the way it places
ASPECT AND MODALITY                                                                           125

correct, because while perfective does indeed indicate a complete situation, to say it indicates
a ‘completed’ situation puts too much emphasis on the termination of it. Perfective presents
all parts (beginning, middle, and end) as a single whole. It does not place emphasis on the
end of a situation or any other part. The Abun particle it, however, does place emphasis on
the end of a situation, and so here we have called it ‘completive’ aspect, rather than
‘perfective’ aspect.
   Put in other words, the completive aspect in Abun is used by a speaker whenever they
want to focus on the finality of an action. For example, when a decision has been made about
something after discussion, the use of the particle it makes it clear that a final decision has
been reached, as in example 7.9.
   7.9       Suk-siri     ne yenggras ki-bot               it
             NOM-wrong det elders           speak-about cam
             On that wrongdoing, the elders have discussed it (and made a final decision).
   Also when an Abun speaker tells a story, the speaker frequently finishes with the phrase
as in example 7.10. The particle it is clearly used to indicate finality or completed action. It is
used to emphasise the terminal point of actions such as discussing as in 7.9 or killing as in
7.11, and states such as knowing as in 7.12.
   7.10      Or             it.
             completely     CAM
             The end.
   7.11      Sinus gu &            yo kwop it.
             Sinus kill body a die             cam
             Sinus has already killed one (wife).
   7.12      An jam        baca ndo     it.
             3sg know read good CAM
             1. She already knows how to read well.
             2. Her knowledge of how to read well has been brought to completion.
   Completive aspect may emphasise the termination of a situation in either the past or the
future. Examples 7.10-7.12 above refer to the past in their contexts. Examples 7.13 and 7.14
below show how completive aspect may be used in future time.
  7.13       An    bi     nggon jam       it         e?
             3sg poss wife          know cam         fqm
             Does your wife (finally) know yet?
  7.14       Yesyim, nan git        sugit      kokro       we        noru    it
             friend  2sg eat        NOM.eat    quickly     because   night   cam

             here wo kw ai git it.
             later fish kwai eat CAM
             Friend, eat the food quickly because it is already night time, the kwai fish will
             finally be biting.


    emphasis on the finality o f the action; hence we have used the term com pletive instead of
    perfective for it.

7.1.3 iNCOMPLETIVEASPECT
    A third aspect type in Abun is that of incompletive; that is, the termination point of an
action or state has not yet taken place. In other words, that action or state is still going on.
Traditionally this aspect type is known as imperfective or continuous. The particle to is used
clause-finally to indicate this where necessary. Thus in example 7.15 the action of speaking is
still continuing, in 7.16 the state of Lamberta being single still continues, and in 7.17 the
action (or, should we say, inaction) of ‘not going’ continues.
   7.15        An    nuk        suk-du     to.
               3pl speak NOM-say           incam
               They are still speaking.
   7.16        Lamberta an nggon-nak             to.
               Lamberta 3sg woman-single incam
               Lamberta is still a single woman.
   7.17        M en yo mu nde to.
               lPL NEC gO NEC INCAM
               We are not going yet.
   Like the other aspects the incompletive may occur in the past, present or future. Examples
7.15-7.17 above illustrate incompletive aspect in the present. Example 7.18 is in the past
(which requires a complex sentence), and 7.19 is in the future.
   7.18        Kamekre an git sugit               to        ete       kw is ge.s   mo    an.
               yesterday 3sg eat NOM.eat incam              and.then snake fall    loc   3sg
               Yesterday he was still eating and a snake fell on him.
   7.19        Be    yen      gu       yu      to.
               later people fight recip incam
               People would still be fighting each other.


7.1.4 Interaction of Abun aspects
   The perfect and completive aspects are very similar in many respects. Abun speakers who
know Indonesian translate re and it with one word, sudah, which is perfect aspect in
Indonesian. Both of these aspects mean that something has occurred or will have occurred,
with the latter giving greater emphasis to the finality of the action as explained above. In
English this distinction is hard to express systematically. For example, in 7.20a and 7.20b,
both sentences mean that the coming has occurred; the former emphasises that the coming
has occurred and he is still here, while the latter emphasises that his coming has finally
occurred, with the implication that he is still here. So Abun speakers may use either,
depending upon which facet they want to emphasise.
   7.20 a.     An ma         re.
               3sg come perf
               He has arrived.
          b.   An ma         it.
               3sg come cam
               He has finally arrived.
ASPECT AND MODALITY                                                                               m

   An Abun speaker may also simply say, An ma ‘He came/is coming’, which does not
emphasise either the persistence of the result (that is, that he is still there) or the finality of his
coming. Normally, when a group of people are waiting for a particular person to arrive, and
then someone sees him coming, they would announce the arrival, as in example 7.20b,
because the finality of the action is of importance to the hearers.
   In a language like Abun which does not use specific tense markers, these two aspect
markers have a close relationship with past time, especially in the absence of any contextual
indications of time reference, such as a temporal adverbial. Likewise, when aspect is
unmarked there is a close relationship with present time. Comrie (1976:83) makes similar
comments regarding the role of aspect in languages without tense markers.
   In answer to a question like that in example 7.13 above, one may answer including either
of the aspect markers, re or to. The actual answer given by the speaker was:
   7.21        An    ki    do     “Nde re.       An bi    nggon            ja m nde t o . ”
               3sg say com neg           perf    3sg perf wife             know neg incam
               He said, “No. His wife does not yet know”.
  He wanted to emphasise two aspects here. Firstly, his wife did not know and this ‘not
knowing’ persisted (nde re) and secondly, she did not yet know and this ‘not knowing’ still
continued, or, in other words, the ‘knowing’ was not yet completed (nde to).
   According to Comrie (1976:24), languages may combine several aspects where they are
compatible and there are formal means to do so. Abun speakers may follow to with re, as
seen in example 7.22, but no evidence has been found of re followed by to or combinations
of to and it, or re and it.
   7.22        An yo       ma     nde to          re.
               3sg neg come neg incam             perf
               He has still not come.


7.2 Modality
   Modality has been defined by Lyons (1977:452) as the attitude or opinion of the speaker
towards the proposition that the sentence expresses, or the situation that the proposition
describes. Lyons considers modality to be a parenthetical sentence-adverb that expresses
speakers’ attitudes such as certainty, necessity, possibility, and doubt. In Abun, a
syntactically distinct closed class of words expresses a speaker’s attitude in some of these
ways. The modals and their types are listed in Table 7.2 below:

                                      TABLE7.2: MODALPARTICLES

          Particle           Modal Type                              Meaning
          ya            possibility                     might
          bayok         probability                     maybe, could, probably
          go            assertive                       should, could really, will certainly
128                                                                                    CHAPTER   7

   These particles are part of the cluster of clause-final particles. They are optional and occur
following any negative and aspect particles, and preceding any mood particles.
   Similar to aspect, modality does not relate to the timing of the event or proposition about
which the speaker expresses an attitude. Each modality type, therefore, can be used in
sentences that are understood to be in the past or future.
   A comparison of modal particles reveals that there is a greater degree of intensity from ya
to bayok to go. (See §7.2.4).


7.2.1 Possibility
   The first type of modal particle is ya, which expresses possibility or ‘might’. This type of
modal can be associated with future time, as seen in examples 7.23 and 7.24, or in the past,
as in 7.25.
   7.23      Prisila ma      sap Barbarina o           ya.
             Prisila came cut Barbarina        again pmm
             Prisila might come and cut Barbarina again.
   7.24      Be    nggon ne ma        o       wa be ku                 men      gane   ya.
             later woman det come again for later meet                 I pl     det    pmm
             The woman might come again in order see us.
   7.25      Kamekre an ma           mo-re          ya.
             yesterday 3sg come LOC-here             pmm
             He possibly came here yesterday.


7.2.2 Probability
   The particle that a speaker uses to indicate that a proposition expressed is probably true is
bayok. The particle bayok is most commonly used when the speaker is confident of the
general amount but not sure of the exact number, both with quantities as seen in example
7.26 and time as in 7.27.
   7.26      Yenggras ki-bot           sor    warn m ek bayok.
             elders     speak-about until times five         frob
             The elders spoke about (a marriage partner for me) probably five times.
   7.27      Pa    kem wade aina          dik bayok.
             child stay until month one prob
             The child probably stayed (there) for one month.
   Other expressions of probability use the same particle, for example, the likelihood/doubt
of having sufficient money as in 7.28, receiving help in 7.29, and understanding as in 7.30.
Note the position of the particle; it follows the negative particle nde in 7.28, as well as aspect
particles, such as it in 7.30.
   7.28      Ji    bi     sugum yo       tep     nde bayok.
             I sg poss money neg enough neg prob
             I probably don’t have enough money.
ASPECT AND MODALITY                                                                           129

   7.29      Be re Yonatan bi         ai      os     nan bayok.
             later Nathan poss father help 2sg prob
             Nathan’s father will probably help you.
   7.30      An ja m             it   bayok.
             3sg understand cam frob
             He probably finally understood.
   As noted above, modality says nothing about the time of an event and the time of the
speech act in relation to it; rather, modal particles express the speaker’s attitude about a
proposition, so modality is not related to tense. Thus, like aspect particles, the modal particle
bayok may be used irrespective of the time referred to, such as present in example 7.28,
future in 7.29, and past in 7.30.


7.2.3 Assertive
   The third type of modality is assertive, which means that the speaker asserts very strongly
that his attitude about the proposition is really true. In other words, the speaker parenthetically
comments, “I really mean it.”, or in Australian colloquial terms, “fair dinkum”. In a culture
where deception is considered positive, speakers need a way to convince the hearer that they
mean business. So in Abun the modal particle go is used to do this. For example:
   7.31      Nan ges go.
             2sg fall ass
             1. You will surely fall.
             2. You will fall, I mean it.
   7.32      An    ndo mo ye           yi      an ndo mo j i          sore go.
             3sg ask loc person other 3sg ask loc I sg only ass
             He asked another person, but he should have just asked me, really.
   7.33      Be an      bi     ya          gu an       kwop re           go.
             later 3sg poss husband kill 3sg die            perf         ass
             Her husband will have killed her, I mean it.
   This modal particle can be used in the past, as seen in example 7.32, but is usually used in
reference to an event that is about to take place, as seen in 7.31 and 7.33.


7.2.4 D ifferences between modal particles
    Modal particles do not co-occur. To change from one to another results in a change of
degree of intensity. There is a progression of certainty from one particle to the next. When
mode is unmarked, nothing is indicated in the speaker’s attitude. When ya is used, the
speaker expresses the attitude that the proposition is possibly true; whereas bayok is a little
stronger, that is probably true; while go asserts the truth of the proposition very strongly, that
is, as almost certain.

                                          NEGATION



   Negation may take a variety of forms, such as ‘negative verbs’, negative particles or fully
bound derivational morphemes (Payne 1985b:222). According to Payne, the use of negative
particles is the most likely form of negation, as is the case in Abun.
   This chapter presents the negation strategy used in Abun. Two particles form the basis of
negation. The primary particle is nde, which is a typical particle, a function word that is
invariant. Consistent with the isolating nature of the Abun language, nde does not vary for
tense, aspect, number or agreement. While nde is primary, a further particle, yo, also
invariant, is used in conjunction with it, mainly in the negation of indicative sentences. These
two particles bracket the predicate. In Abun, whenever two particles are used like this, the
function is to mark the extent of a particular grammatical constituent. Bracketing by a pair of
particles not only is one of the main strategies used in negation, but also is used in the
formation of relative clauses, both restrictive and unrestrictive (see §9), as well as
interrogative sentences (see §6.1). In most cases of negation, the pair of particles yo...nde
bracket the predicate to negate Abun sentences.
   The primary particle, nde, is used in all types of negation. Not only is it used as the
primary negation particle, but standing alone it simply means ‘no’. When a question is asked
and the response is negative, a simple nde is sufficient in reply. In contrast, the other negative
particle, yo, is used only in conjunction with nde. So it can be said that nde is indeed the
primary or basic negative particle.
  The particle nde is required to form prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions and negative equational sentences (§8.1).
   The secondary particle yo is used in conjunction with the primary particle in the formation
of the following sentence types: negative indicative sentences, negative information-seeking
interrogatives, negative descriptive sentences, negative location sentences. It is also used in
the negation of subordinate clauses (§8.2).
   Placement of the negative particles when they occur is invariant: yo always precedes the
predicate, while nde always follows the predicate. The following example illustrates negation
of a simple indicative sentence, where both yo and nde are obligatory:
   8.1 a.   An    ma     mo nu.
             3pl come loc house
             They came to the house.
       b.    An yo       ma     mo nu             nde.
             3pl net, come loc house              NEC
             They did not come to the house.



                                               131
132                                                                                   CHAPTER 8


   In the above example the predicate ma mo nu is bracketed by the linked pair of particles,
yo follows the subject and precedes the predicate, and nde follows the predicate. If, for
example, the subject of a negative indicative sentence is preceded by yo, this would be
syntactically unacceptable to an Abun speaker. Word order here is rigid. The particles must
bracket the whole predicate, p r e d (includes v, o and any adjuncts). The subject is never
included within the bracket for reasons discussed under the scope of negation in §8.5.
   There are two patterns of negation found in Abun as follows:
                                           s p r e d nde
                                         s yo p r e d nde
   They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In svo languages
the negative particle normally precedes the verb (Payne 1985b:224). One would expect the
particle nde to be preverbal, but instead, in Abun, it is not only postverbal but also postobject
and adjunct. This pattern type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented
languages such as Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi andTera (Payne 1985b:226).
   Furthermore the second pattern type, where a pair of linked negative particles occur, is
also uncommon. In French a linked pair of particles is used in negation, but this pair brackets
only the verb and its associated clitics, whereas in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole
predicate including object and adjuncts. However, this pattern type is an attested one in some
Chadic languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1985b:225-226). The difference
with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun. In Hausa both particles
can move to bracket the constituent that is to be negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope and focus of negation (Schachter 1985:60).
   Syntax of negation involving the use of nde (§8.1), the use of yo (§8.2), negation in
subordinate clauses (§8.3), negation in words (§8.4) and a discussion of the scope of
negation in Abun (§8.5) provides an organising framework for the remainder of this chapter.


8.1 T he u s e o f tide
   As indicated earlier, the simplest negative sentence is just the negative reply to a question,
‘Nde’. In this section, types of negative structures that require the use of nde without yo are
discussed. These types of structure are: prohibitive sentences, positive-negative alternative
questions, and negative equational sentences.


8.1.1 Prohibitive sentences
   The primary negative particle nde is the only negative particle used to form prohibitive
sentences. The structure of this type of sentence is s pred nde, as in example 8.2b. The
prohibitive sentence structure is used in Abun when the speaker wants to prohibit the subject
from doing a particular thing. Negative imperative sentences are the most common type of
prohibitive sentence. Example 8.2a is a simple indicative sentence, while 8.2b is the same
sentence transformed to become a negative imperative sentence.
   8.2 a.       Nan   wo.
                2 sg  cry
                You are crying.
NEGATION                                                                                   133

         b.   Nan wo nde!
              2sg cry neg
              Don’t cry!
   Here we have used the label ‘prohibitive’ to cover a more general type of negative
imperative (which includes first and third person, as well as second person) to distinguish it
from the normal use of the term ‘negative imperative’, which implies a negative command to
only the second person, as discussed by Sadock and Zwicky (1985:160) and in §6.2.3.
   The same structure is used in Abun for all prohibitive sentences including first and third
persons, as in examples 8.3 and 8.4. In these cases the English translation is more like ‘We
must not eat possum’! or ‘Women must not touch cassowary’!
   8.3 a.     M en git sek.
              I pl  eat possum
              We are eating/ate possum.
         b.   M en git sek        nde.
              I pl eat possum neg
              We must not eat possum.
   8.4 a.     Nggon syim tok ndamsyor.
              women touch       cassowary
              The women are touching/touch cassowaries.
         b.   Nggon syim tok ndamsyor nde.
              women touch      cassowary neg
              Women must not touch cassowaries.


8.1.2 Positive-negative alternative questions
  The primary negative particle is also used in asking positive-negative alternative questions.
The structure of this type is:
                                     s pred bade nde e?
   These questions could be called negative tag questions with a positive-negative alternative,
‘Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?’, as in example 8.5 where a person is being
asked to make a decision between positive and negative alternatives.
   8.5        Nan satu        mo nan bi         nggon bado, nde e ?
              2sg go.back loc 2sg poss woman aqvi neg ynqvi
              Do you want to go back to your wife, or not?
   Example 8.6 has the same structure, but differs in meaning. It comes from a text where
the speaker is lecturing another about his relationship with his wife. He is not asking whether
the one addressed thinks about his wife, or not, as in a positive-negative alternative type of
question. Rather, he is using it as a rhetorical question with the meaning, ‘You don’t think
about your wife’! The context makes it clear when a negative tag question is being asked or is
being used rhetorically.
134                                                                                 CHAPTER 8


  8.6        Nan nutbot         nan bi       nggon       bado, tide e?
             2sg think.about 2sg POSS woman              AQM NEC YNQM
             Don’t you think about your wife?
  Negative yes/no interrogative structures such as, ‘Are you not going?’ are not used in
Abun. Instead the Abun speaker would formulate this type of question as, Nan mu e? ‘Are
you going?’


8.1.3 Negative equational sentences
   Equational sentences, which attribute a nominal to the subject, are negated by the use of
nde. These sentence types are verbless and their structure as shown in the examples below is:
                                       s nominal nde
             An     ye-nden.
             3sg person-inland
             He is an inland person.
             An    ye-nden          nde.
             3sg person-inland NEG
             He is not an inland person.
             Ji bi       ai      yewon.
             lSG POSS father shaman
             My father is a shaman.
        b.   Ji bi       ai       yewon      nde.
             lSG POSS father shaman          NEG
             My father is not a shaman.
   When the nominal is a demonstrative the same pattern is followed, as in example 8.9
below.
   8.9 a.    Ndar anane.
             dog DET
             That is a dog.
        b.   Ndar anane nde.
             dog DET        NEG
             That is not a dog.
   Where the subject is a possessed item the same structure is used. Example 8.10 illustrates
alienable possession and 8.11 illustrates inalienable possession. The negation of the sentences
are shown in 8.10b and 8.11b.
   8.10 a. An bi         nu   anane.
           3sg poss house det
           That is his house.
         b. An bi          nu      anane     nde.
            3sg poss house det               neg
            That is not his house.
NEGATION                                                                                  135

   8.11 a. Ji     de     anane.
           I sg blood DET
           That is my blood.
           b. Ji    de       anane     nde.
              lSG blood DET            NEC
              That is not my blood.


8.2 T he use of yo
   The negative particle yo is used in negative indicative sentences, information-seeking
interrogative sentences, negative descriptive and location sentences and in the negation of
complex sentences. It is never used to negate a sentence by itself, but is always linked with
the primary negative particle nde. These two particles form a linked pair that bracket the
predicate of the sentence. The particle yo always occurs between a subject and predicate. The
word order is rigid.
   The use of linked pairs of negative particles is uncommon. However French is a well-
documented example of the use of a linked pair of negative particles, for example, j e
ne...suis pas. The first particle ne is the primary particle and then pas is added. Payne
(1985b:224) claims that in the case where such linked pairs of negative particles do occur, the
second particle occurs because there is a strong tendency for a single negative particle to be
reinforced and emphasised by the addition of a second particle. Payne analyses pas as the
added particle that reinforces the negation in French.
   By way of contrast, Abun places the primary particle after the predicate, not before as in
French. Also the operation of the secondary particle in Abun is not so much to reinforce the
negation of a sentence as Payne claims of French, but rather to mark the predicate and thus
delineate the scope of negation.


8.2.1 N egative indicative sentences
  The basic structure of a negative indicative sentence is:
                                         s yo   pred nde

   Whatever elements are within the predicate (such as verb, object, any adjuncts, and
embedded clauses), all are bracketed by the pair of particles, yo and nde. Irrespective of
whether the sentence is intransitive, transitive or ditransitive, yo remains constant in both
form and position. Likewise, nde remains constant in form and position. Each of these
sentence types is illustrated in the examples below:
  8.12 a. Pa       mwa       it    mo kelas gri.                (intransitive)
          children many      rise loc class three
          Many children did go up to grade three.
         b. Pa       mwa      yo     it    mo kelas gri          nde.
            children many nbg rise loc class three               neg
            Many children did not go up to grade three.
136                                                                                CHAPTER 8


  8.13 a. M en ku     mbre          ne       mo nu.             (transitive)
          I pl find eastem.cloth det         loc house
          We found the eastern cloth in the house.
         b. M en yo      ku mbre              ne      mo nu          nde.
            I pl neg find eastem.cloth DEr            loc house      neg
            We didn’t find the eastern cloth in the house.
   8.14 a.   Ye syo sugum       nai     ji.                (ditransitive)
             3pl give money io           I sg
             They gave money to me.
         b. Ye yo     syo sugum nai j i    nde.
            3pl NEG give money io lSG NEG
            They didn’t given money to me.


8.2.2 Negative INFORMATION-SEEKINGINTERROGATIVES
   In contrast to positive-negative alternative questions, negative interrogative sentences
seeking information require both negative particles, yo and nde, such as in the following
examples:
   8.15 a.   Te   nan ma     wa        suma ne?
             iqm  2sg come for         what FQM
             Why have you come?
         b. Te   nan yo       ma nde            wa    suma ne ?
            IQM 2SG NEG come NEG                for   what FQM
            Why didn’t you come?
   8.16 a. Je      u     ana ma ne?
           person what TOP come FQM
           Who has come?
         b. Je      u       ana yo ma nde
            person which TOP NEG come NEG
            Who has not come?
    Take note that the interrogative mood also has two bracketing particles, te the initial
question marker and ne the final question marker. The bracketing required to negate a clause
falls within the bracketing required to form an interrogative construction, as seen in example
8.15b.


8.2.3 Negative descriptive sentences
   A descriptive sentence is defined as a sentence that attributes an adjective to a noun, for
example ‘Musa has a big arm’ or ‘The book is old’. The behaviour of words that could be
considered adjectives in Abun does not differ greatly from that of verbs. These words can act
as predicates, and so both particles are required to negate these sentence types. In such
sentences the adjectival part of the sentence is negated using the linked pair of yo and nde.
The structure of negative descriptive sentences as shown in the examples below is:
                                     syo   adjective nde
NEGATION                                                                                137

   8.17 a.       Isak bi     nggwe      sye.
                Isak poss garden        big
                Isak’s garden is big.
           b.    Isak bi    nggwe      yo      sye   nde.
                Isak poss garden       neg     big   neg
                Isak’s garden is not big.
   8.18 a. M usa i.
           Musa sick
           Musa is sick.
           b. M usa yo      i   nde.
              Musa neg sick neg
              Musa is not sick.
   This same construction holds when the subject of the sentence is expanded, for example
by means of a relative clause such as, ‘The children who went up to third grade’. The
description of this subject, namely mwa ‘many’, is negated in the same way using the linked
pair, as in the example below:
   8.19 a. Pa        ga    it    mo kelas gri         ne mwa.
           children who rise LOC grade three det many
           The children who went up to grade three were many.
         b. Pa        ga     it   mo kelas gri         ne yo       mwa nde.
            children who rise loc grade three DET NEC many neg
            The children who went up to grade three were not many.


8.2.4 Negative location sentences
   A location sentence attributes a location to the subject. Since location is one of the
predicate elements it also is negated by using both particles. The structure as shown in the
examples below is:
                                 s yo   locative phrase/ word   nde
  8.20 a. Musa mo nu.
          Musa loc house
          Musa is at home.
        b. Musa yo       mo nu  nde.
           Musa neg loc house nbg
           Musa is not at home.
  8.21 a. Dao bi     im         mo-re.
          Dao poss mother Loc-here
          Dao’s mother is here.
        b. Dao bi     im        yo mo-re                nde.
           Dao poss mother neg Loc-here                 nbg
           Dao’s mother is not here.
138                                                                                  CHAPTER 8


  The locative phrase has the preposition mo (as in the examples above), which also in some
contexts means ‘to exist’, and the negation of which follows the same pattern as in any
negative indicative sentence, as in the example below:
   8.22 a.     Sugum mo.
              money exist
              There is money.
         b.    Sugum yo mo             nde.
              money neg exist          neg
              There is no money.


8.2.5 Negation in complex sentences
  Complex sentences, where a clause is embedded within a main clause, are negated in
Abun in the same way as simple sentences. The pattern is:
                                          s yo PRED nde,
where clauses may be embedded in the object position, such as in example 8.23. The word
order remains rigid in these constructions, with the whole of the predicate including the
embedded clause bracketed by the particles.
   8.23 a. Ji    me    Isak ben suk          mo            nggwe.
            I sg see    Isak do      things loc            garden
           I saw Isak working in the garden.
         b.    Ji    yo      me Isak ben suk            mo nggwe nde.
              I sg neg see Isak           do things LOC garden neg
              I did not see Isak working in the garden.
   A complement expressing indirect speech is introduced by the subordinating conjunction
do, and is also embedded in the object position as in example 8.24. The negation of this type
of complex sentence follows the same pattern as for a simple sentence.
   8.24 a. M oses ki gado    do    an        kra     su Barbarina           o.
           Moses sayearlier that 3sg         marry with Barbarina           again
           Earlier Moses said again that he would marry Barbarina.
         b.   M oses yo k i      gado do an          kra    su   Barbarina       o       nde.
              Moses NEG say earlier that 3sg marry with Barbarina                again   neg
              Earlier Moses did not say again that he would marry Barbarina.


8.2.6 T he interaction of yo and nde
    In summary, the negation of a sentence with just the primary particle nde means that one
is not allowed or prohibited to do a particular thing, as in example 8.25b. In contrast to this,
the addition of the secondary negative particle (or predicate marker) yo changes the nature of
the sentence to become simply a negative indicative statement, as in 8.25c.
   8.25 a. An ma.
           3sg come
           He came.
NEGATION                                                                                  139

           b. An ma      nde.
              3sg come neg
              He cannot come.
           c. An yo       ma   nde.
              3sg neg     come nbg
              He did not come.
   The use of nde alone implies that there is something that prevents the person doing
something or makes it impossible for the person to do something, as in the example, ‘He
cannot come’. We do not actually know why he cannot come. But when the speaker simply
wants to make an indicative statement that he has not or did not come, then the additional
particle yo makes that clear. That is, there was nothing preventing the person from coming,
they just have not come.


8.3 Negation in subordinate clauses
   According to Payne (1985b:240), in many languages the devices which are used for
negating subordinate clauses are different from those used in main clauses. He cites several
examples, including Yoruba, where the main clause negative particle is kd, while the particle
used to negate subordinate clauses is md. In Abun most subordinate clauses are negated in
the same way as main clauses, the only exception being negative purpose subordinate
clauses, as in English ‘lest’ (or ‘in order that...not’).
   For example, in 8.26a the whole sentence is negated. By way of contrast, 8.26b illustrates
how the embedded clause itself may be negated, resulting in a different meaning. The same
pair of negative particles is used.
   8.26 a.     Ji yo     me      Isak ben suk           mo   nggwe    nde.
              I sg neg see       Isak do       things loc    garden   neg
              I did not see Isak working at the garden.
         b.   Ji me Isak yo            ben suk         mo    nggwe    nde.
              I sg see Isak     neg    do     things   loc   garden   neg
              I saw Isak not working at the garden.
   Again, when the subordinate clause is indirect speech introduced by the subordinating
conjunction do, the negation of that clause uses the same pair of linked particles. In example
8.27a the whole sentence is negated, whereas 8.27b shows the negation of the subordinate
clause.
   8.27 a. M oses yo ki gado do an kra                 su    Barbarina o        nde.
           Moses neg say earlier that 3sg marry with Barbarina            again neg
           Earlier Moses did not say again that he would marry Barbarina.
         b. M oses k i gado do an yo              kra    su    Barbarina       o     nde.
            Moses say earlier that 3sg neg marry with Barbarina                again neg
            Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.
140                                                                                 CHAPTER 8


   Abun does have a form corresponding to the English ‘lest’, which consists of the
preposition kadit ‘from’ linking with the primary negative particle nde to bracket the
subordinate clause as illustrated in example 8.28.
  8.28       Nan os j i         kadit    ji    ku suki            nde.
             2sg help Iso lest           lSG get sickness         neg
             1. Help me lest I get sick.
             2. Help me in order that I don’t get sick.
   8.29      Nan os        ji     kadit    ji   mu k e t os   ibit nde.
             2sg help      I sg lest       lSG go  along way bad neg
             1. Help me   from not going on a bad way.
             2. Help me   lest 1 go on a bad way.
   In both examples 8.28 and 8.29 the preposition kadit ‘from’, which normally pre-empts a
noun phrase, is followed by an embedded clause. Embedded clauses of this nature, when
negated, do not use the secondary negative particle yo since it has been replaced by kadit.
This happens even though they may be of the sentence type that normally requires both
negative particles.
   A further clarification of negation in subordinate clauses is necessary in the case where a
relative clause in the object position is negated as well as the whole sentence. In such a case
only one nde is required, as in example 8.30a. This particle forms the bracket for both the
subordinate clause and the sentence. There are two occurrences of yo in 8.30a, whereas in
8.30b only the relative clause is negated, while in 8.30c the whole sentence is negated.
   8.30 a. An yo        git roti       goto yo            it     nde.
           3sg neg      eat bread rel           neg       rise   neg
           He did not eat bread that was not risen.
          b. An    git    roti gato yo        it         nde.
             3sg eat      bread rel     neg   rise       neg
             He ate bread that was not risen.
          c. An yo        git roti       gato it          nde.
             3sg neg      eat bread rel           rise    neg
             He did not eat bread that was risen.
   A similar structure (with two occurrences of yo and one of nde) is used to indicate that a
particular action has never been done, as in example 8.31. Both occurrences of yo are
preferred here because Musa does not eat fish and he has not ever done this. The second
occurrence of yo can be omitted, but Abun speakers tend to include it to reinforce the point
they are making — ‘Musa doesn’t eat fish, he never does’.
   8.31      Musa yo git boge yo               mo        nde.
             Musa neg eat fish neg             exist     neg
             Musa has never eaten fish.
   For further discussion of negation in subordinate clauses see §10.2.5 and §10.3.1.2.
NEGATION                                                                                       141

8.4 Negation in words
   Abun is a language with very little affixation. As may be expected there are no affixes
used to negate words, as in the case of English, with words such as ‘un-happy’ and ‘dislike’.
However, there are a number of verbs that are inherently negative in meaning such as:
                  bari          do not want
                  bagri         do not want to eat
                  bambrai       do not want to do something
                  bandof        do not feel comfortable with heights
                  bagwo         do not like being tickled
  Ba- could be analysed as a negative prefix, but the roots -ri, -gri, -brai, -ndof and
-gwo do not occur as free morphemes.
   These verbs remove the need for the use of the negative particles. Example 8.32a is a
negative indicative sentence. The use of an inherently negative verb (bariwa ‘do not want to’,
as in example 8.32b), without the negative particles has the same meaning as the
corresponding positive verb used with the negative particles. The use of the inherently
negative verb with the negative particles makes the meaning a positive one, as in 8.32c.
           a. Ji    yo       i-wa        ji     mu    mo nggwe nde.

            1 .1 am not against going to the garden.
            2 .1 want to go to the garden.


8.5 T he SCOPEOFNEGATION
   Klima (1964), Reesink (1986) and Payne (1985b) discuss the scope of negation in terms
of ‘constituent’ and ‘sentential’. The negation of words or phrases may be called ‘constituent
negation’, while the negation of predicates, sentences and more complex sentences has
traditionally been called ‘sentential negation’. These two terms were coined initially in relation
to English. In the sentence, ‘John is unhappy’, the negation is defined as ‘constituent’
because the negation operates on one part (or constituent) of the sentence; while in ‘John is
not happy’, the type of negation is defined as ‘sentential’.
   In Abun the scope of negation is usually sentential (or, more precisely, the negation of the
predicate) and this is syntactically marked by use of the linked pair of negative particles
(§8.5.1). Take, for example, the sentence in example 8.33, a simple negative indicative
sentence where the two negative particles surround the predicate. In this case, the action
(killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river) all fall within the scope of
negation. The subject (Isak), however, does not fall within the scope of negation here because
subjects are usually contextually bound.
142                                                                                      CHAPTER 8


   8.33      Isak yo      gu     nok        mo syur N ai de               nde.
             Isak NEC kill wild.pig loc water Nai bank                    neg
             Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
   As to which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in most
cases be clear from the context, but there are syntactic strategies by which the scope of
negation can be narrowed to focus on one constituent. This is discussed in §8.5.2.


8.5.1 T he scope with both negative particles
   The scope of negation is readily determined by the use of the linked pair of negative
particles, yo and nde. These two particles bracket the predicate, making the scope of negation
syntactically evident. In Abun the scope of negation, when the linked pair of negative
particles is used, is always encoded as a predicate since the linked particles always and only
bracket a predicate. The subject can never be bracketed by the two negative particles.
   Payne (1985b: 199) points out that subjects are usually context-bound and that contextually
bound elements are removed from the scope of negation. What is actually negated is the
contextually free part of the sentence. This, he says, “...often gives the impression that
sentential negation might better be described as ‘VP negation” ’. Indeed, this is clearly the
case for Abun because the syntax makes that evident by the way the two particles bracket the
predicate (that is, the VP).
    Therefore when both particles are used, the scope of negation excludes the subject. When
we consider a situation where someone is discussing a hunting trip, one might say, ‘Isak
killed a pig near the Nai river’. In order to negate this sentence, one would say, ‘Isak did not
kill a pig near the Nai river’, as in example 8.33. In this example, the subject, Isak, is not
within the scope of negation because it is contextually bound; that is, Isak’s actions were
under discussion. It is the relationship between Isak and the killing of a pig near the Nai river
that falls within the scope of the negation. The scope of negation when both particles are used
is the predicate, as is evidenced by the position of the two negative particles.
   So it is either the action (killing), the object (the wild pig) or the location (by the Nai river)
that could be negated. All three of these fall within the scope of negation. The subject, Isak,
does not. Which constituent is actually being negated in the mind of the speaker would in
most cases be clear from the context.
   The shifting of words and phrases from outside to inside the bracketing of the linked pair
of negative particles illustrates that the two particles do in fact determine the scope of
negation. In example 8.34, if kamdik-kamdik ‘every day’ is included within the bracket it is
also included within the scope of negation. If it is inside the bracket as in 8.34c, then the
frequency of eating fish is also negated. Therefore the meaning changes to ‘I do not eat fish
every day’ or ‘Not every day I eat fish’, implying that on some days fish is eaten, but not
every day. Example 8.34b has ‘every day’ outside of the bracket formed by the linked pair of
particles. In this way the action of eating, and the object, fish, are within the scope of
negation, but not the frequency. The temporal word in this case is outside of the scope
negation. In this way the two negative particles delineate the scope of negation, in the sense
that whatever falls between them falls within the scope of negation.
NEGATION                                                                                  143

   8.34 a. Ji     git boge kam-dik-kam-dik.
           lSG eat fish day-one-day-one
           I eat fish everyday.
           b. Kam-dik-kam-dik j i       yo    git   boge    nde.
              day-one-day-one      I sg neg eat     fish    neg
              1. Every day I do not eat fish.
              2 .1 never eat fish.
         c. Ji    yo     git boge        kam-dik-kam-dik nde.
            lSG NEG eat fish              day-one-day-one NEG
            1. Not every day I eat fish.
            2 .1 do not eat fish every day (I do sometimes).
   Phrases such as temporal phrases or locative phrases may be inserted either before the
subject or within the predicate, as seen in examples 8.34 and 8.35. Phrases placed outside
yo...nde are outside the scope of negation.
   8.35 a. Isak yo      ben suk       mo nggwe nde.
           Isak NEG do things loc garden neg
           Isak did not do anything at the garden.
         b. M o nggwe Isak yo            ben suk           nde.
            loc garden Isak        neg do      things      neg
            In the garden Isak did not do anything.
   In example 8.35a, the garden falls within the scope of negation. Isak may not have been at
the garden. He may have done things elsewhere. In 8.35b, the garden is outside the scope of
negation. It is contextually bound, since a construction of this nature occurs only when the
garden is being discussed. Information considered contextually free is bracketed by particles.
   In complex sentences it is clear how the scope of negation changes according to what is
bracketed. In example 8.36, when the bracketing changes from the whole sentence to the
complement, the meaning is significantly different.
   8.36 a. M oses yo     ki gado        do    an kra      su    Barbarina o nde.
           Moses neg say earlier that 3sg marry with Barbarina again NEG
           Moses did not say earlier that he would marry Barbarina again.
         b. M oses k i gado do         an yo      kra    su    Barbarina o nde.
            Moses say earlier that 3sg neg marry with Barbarina again NEG
            Earlier Moses said that he would not marry Barbarina again.
   In a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of negation by
the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles can move around to bracket
the subject, the predicate or other parts of the sentence. Examples are found in Schachter
(1985:60). However word order is not rigid as it is in Abun. In Hausa, both particles can
move to bracket the constituent that is being negated and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope as well as the focus of negation. Abun’s use of the linked particles is not as flexible:
because for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked pair of particles.
However the subject may be included in the scope of negation as discussed in the next
section.
144                                                                                       CHAPTER 8


8.5.2 Narrowingthescopeofnegation
   Example 8.33 above does not specify which of the components within the predicate are
being negated. Was it not a wild pig killed? Was it not a killing? Was it not at that location?
All of these components are within the scope of negation. To know which component is
being negated one needs to refer to the context of the discussion. Since negative sentences are
rarely said in isolation, that part which is being negated is usually known from the context.
   In English several strategies are used to narrow the scope of negation to the elements of
the sentence or predicate that the speaker wants to negate. These include the use of
phonological devices such as emphatic stress, or syntactic devices such as cleft constructions.
So, for example, the use of intonation to stress components of the sentence is a way to negate
a constituent as in, ‘Isak did not eat the RICE (but the fish)’. Or, ‘Isak did not EAT the rice
(but he just swallowed it)’. Alternatively, or in addition, syntactic features may be used to
negate a constituent. Topicalisation, for example, is used in English, ‘It was not the rice that
Isak ate’.
   In the same way, Abun, like English, has some syntactic techniques that enable us to
focus on the negation of a certain part of the sentence. Essentially the constituent to be
negated needs to be bracketed by yo and nde. In order to achieve this the predicate needs to
be transformed so that only one constituent is bracketed by the negative particles. As a result
of limiting the scope of negation, elements within the predicate are topicalised or relativised.
The scope can also be narrowed by a second use of the particle, yo.
   Firstly, by t o p i c a l i s i n g elements of the predicate the scope of negation is narrowed.
Topicalisation of an element removes such an element from the scope of negation, thereby
reducing the number of possibilities to which the negation may apply. So, for example, if the
wild pig in example 8.37a, is topicalised, it becomes 8.37b, meaning that either the action
(killing) or the location fall within the scope of negation. If, then, the location is likewise
topicalised, as in 8.37c, the result is that either the action or the object falls within the scope of
negation. Also it is possible to front both the object and the location, thereby effectively
narrowing the scope of the negation to the action alone. Thus, in 8.37d, the wild pig near the
Nai river is under discussion and Isak did not kill it; he must have done something else to it.
   8.37 a.     Isak  yo gu         nok       mo     syur    N ai de nde.
               Isak NEC kill wild.pig m e water Nai bank NEC
               Isak did not kill a wild pig by the Nai river.
          b.   N ok       ne I s a k yo     gu     mo    syur    N a i de nde.
               wild.pig det Isak n e g kill l o c water Nai bank NEC
               That wild pig Isak did not kill by the Nai river.
          c. Mo syur N a i d e           Isak     yo    gu      nok      nde.
             LOC water Nai bank Isak n e g kill                 wild.pig n e g
             By the Nai river, Isak did not kill a wild pig.
          d. N ok      ga mo s y u r N a i d e          ne     Isak yo       gu      nde.
             wild.pig rel loc water Nai bank det Isak n e g kill n e g
             (Concerning) a wild pig that was by the Nai river, Isak did not kill (it).
   Secondly, in order to narrow the scope of negation to the modifier of a noun head of the
subject, the predicate of the sentence may be relativised to become embedded within the
subject position, with the modifier becoming the negated predicate. Take, for example, the
NEGATION                                                                                    145

modifier of the head of the noun phrase, mwa ‘many’, in example 8.38a. Sentential negation
of 8.38a is shown in 8.38b. But to narrow the scope of negation to the constituent, mwa, a
structural change is made to form 8.38c, where the item to be negated, mwa alone is
bracketed by yo and nde. To achieve this, the predicate of 8.38b is relativised to become part
of the subject and mwa then behaves as a predicate and can be negated with the linked pair of
negative particles, as in 8.38c.
   8.38 a.   Pa        mwa it     mo kelas gri.
             children many go.up loc grade three
             Many children went up to grade three.
         b. Pa        mwa yo         it     mo      kelas gri        nde.
            children many neg go.up loc grade three                  neg
            Many children did not go up to grade three.
         c. Pa         ga    it mo kelas gri           ne yo       mwa nde.
            children who rise loc grade three det neg many neg
            The children who went up to grade three were not many.
   Finally, the scope can also be narrowed by the use of yo a second time in the sentence to
intensify or emphasise the negation thereof; compare example 8.39a to 8.39b, 8.39c and
8.39d. This second use of yo is limited to occasions when it precedes the verb mo ‘to exist’
   8.39 a. Men yo         ku    an    mo       nde.
           I pl neg        meet 3sg exist     neg
           1. We have    not ever met him.
           2. We have    never met him.
         b. M en ku       an yo     mo nde.
            I pl meet    3sg neg exist neg
            1. We have met him, never.
            2. We have never met him.
         c. M en yo   ku      an nde.
            I pl neg meet 3sg neg
            We have not met him.
         d. Men yo     ku     an yo        mo         nde.
            I pl neg meet 3sg neg exist               neg
            1. We have not met him, never.
            2. We have NEVER met him.
   In Abun the use of topicalisation, fronting and relativisation of predicates or part thereof,
or a second use of yo to narrow the scope of negation (to focus on or emphasise one
constituent of a sentence) is not very common. In most cases the constituent being negated is
understood from the context, obviating the need for such constructions.

                                   RELATIVE CLAUSES



   In this section subordinate clauses of the type known as relative clauses will be discussed.
In Abun, relative clauses can be divided into the two basic types, restrictive and non-
restrictive. The restrictive type is by far the more common and more flexible grammatical
structure and so it will be discussed in more detail here. This discussion will attempt to show
that the Abun relative clause utilises a relative conjunction together with a strategy called a
gap strategy, in order to relativise various grammatical relations.
   By using a different conjunction, a non-restrictive relative clause as well as a third type
which could be described as an indefinite relative clause are also possible in the Abun
language. These will be described in detail below.


9.1 The structure of relative clauses in Abun
   Relative clauses have been described as consisting minimally of a head and a restricting
clause (Comrie 1989:143). How do Abun relative clauses compare to this general
description? This discussion illustrates that the Abun relative clause consists minimally of a
head, a relative conjunction and a clause that is either restricting or non-restricting. In some
cases a determiner follows the relative clause. Examples of these clauses are shown below.

(i) Abun restrictive relative clause
            HEAD+ CONJUNCTION- g o t o + RESTRICTINGCLAUSE
   9.1       Men mu gu ye          goto man siri   su men bi        nggon.
             I pl go kill person rel do wrong with I pl poss woman
             We will go and kill the person who committed adultery with our (clans)
             woman.

(ii) Abun restrictive relative clause with determiner
            HEAD+ CONJUNCTION- g a t O + RESTRICTINGCLAUSE+ DETERMINER
   9.2       Men mu de       syur mo syur wak goto nje                   ben ne.
             I pl go go.in water at water hole rel people                make DET
             We went and washed at the well that people had made.

(iii) Abun indefinite relative clause
            HEAD+ CONJUNCTION- to + RESTRICTINGCLAUSE

   9.3      Ye     to gwa         ye-won                dabe yo       ye

            Anyone who punches a shaman (lit. knowledge person) on the ear must pay a
            fine with (antique) eastern cloth.

(iv) Abun non-restrictive relative clause
            HEAD+ CONJUNCTION- to + NON-RESTRICTINGCLAUSE+ DETERMINER
   9.4      An k i nai Martinus        to-re     to kra    Domingas
            3SG say 10 Martinus        DElc-this REL marry Domingas

                            name com Simam Yorfen com
            He said to Martinus’ father (the Martinus here, who married Domingas)
            (whose) name was Simam Yorfen that...


9.2 The HEADOFTHERELATIVECLAUSE
   The head which is to be relativised may consist of either a noun phrase as in example 9.5,
a pronoun, as in example 9.6, or a pro-form, as in examples 9.7, 9.8 and 9.9 below.
  9.5       Suk-jan       goto an jan        mo nggwe ne       here te.
            NOM-plant rel 3pl plant in garden m \              fut  die
            Plants that they plant in that garden will die.
  9.6       Nan goto ben suk-daret         bu       ji    bari       re!
            2sg rel do NOM-random always lSG not.want perf
            You, who always behave carelessly, I want nothing to do with you!
  9.7       Sane kwa          goto me-ka-we yo              ben ndo       nde,
            so   part.some.of rel lPL-CL-two neg            do good       neg

            3PL-two say NOM-speak rel fut help 2pl
            So the part which the two of us didn’t do very well, they (two) told us things
            (lit. ‘news’) that would help us.
  9.8       Ji k i do do        goto y enggras         k i ete

            I said I would marry whichever (woman) the elders nominate for me and are
            happy with.
  9.9       Ndam kokor do             goto ku suk-i           yo        men gu we.
            bird   fowl some.of rel get NOM-sick when.iRR I pl kill off

   The pro-forms kwa and do both have a similar meaning. They both refer to a previously
mentioned noun phrase which usually represents a group of undefined size. When either kwa
or do are used they refer to part of the previously mentioned whole. Kwa can only be used
with non-tangible referents (that is, nouns that cannot be counted or considered specific
items). For this reason it is best translated as ‘part o f or ‘some o f . Do can be used only with
specific or tangible referents.
   In the instance where the head of the relative clause is the noun suk ‘thing/things’, this
noun merges with the relative clause conjunction to create a compound form. The final k is
lost so that the resultant form is sugato ‘thing that/that which’, as in examples 9.10 and 9.11
below.
   9.10      Pa    git su-gato       sye mo nde.
             child eat things-that big exist neg
             The children must not eat large animals (lit. anything that is large) at all.
   9.11      M en nut-bot      su-gato    men ben           nyim ne.
             I pl think-about things-that I pl do           before det
             We thought about what we did earlier.


9.3 The relative conjunction goto
   The relative conjunction goto is made up of two morphemes: ga ‘anaphoric referent/the
former’ and to ‘noun modifying particle (nmp)’. Gato may be translated as ‘that’, ‘which’,
‘who’ and so on. In quick speech it is abbreviated to ga, indicating that the particle to, which
carries a grammatical meaning rather than a lexical one, is not always considered necessary.
Gato is not a relative clause pronoun since neither ga nor to can be used on their own to
replace nouns, as will be further discussed below. However, gato cannot be described as a
general subordinating conjunction (as is the case with English ‘that’). Gato is exclusively
used to mark constructions of the restrictive relative clause type. A study of its two
component morphemes shows how it fulfils this role.


9.3.1 Anaphoric referent ga
   The particle ga ‘anaphoric referent’ was briefly introduced in Chapter 3 as a type of
determiner (see §3.4.1). As such it can never be used on its own as a pronoun to replace
some previously mentioned noun. Ga always modifies a noun and is always part of a noun
phrase. It assists in referring to a previously mentioned noun. In discourse it serves to
distinguish secondary participants from the main participant/speaker. The noun which ga
modifies will have been introduced earlier as a secondary participant. When this participant is
mentioned again, ga is added as if to remind the hearers. In the examples below, several
sentences of the discourse have been included to show how this particle is used.
RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                            149

   9.12      Ji k i do “A           me-wa ber-gan          Prisila ku Barbarina re"
             I sg say com 2sg      look-TRS later-little   Prisila meet Barbarina this
             Ji   do ma       sa        Prisila ga w ai         mo ji.
             I sg pred come when.REAL Prisila ana go.past at         I sg
             I said, “You look out (for yourself). In a little while Prisila will meet
             Barbarina”. As I was coming along Prisila, that I had just mentioned, came
             past me.
   9.13      Sepenyel mu fro     bi   suk    or     an ma
             Sepenyel go prepare poss things finish 3SG come
             ti      kenyak           ji    mo j i  bi   nu.   Ji si
             seaward plan.to.meet      I sg at I sg poss house I sg with
             an ga mu mo syu-Nggwe.
             3sg ana go to river-Garden
             After Sepenyel went to prepare his things he went to meet me at my house. I
             went together with him (the last mentioned) to Garden River.
   In the English translation of these sentences it seems awkward to include the literal
meaning of ga ‘the one that was last mentioned’. In Abun discourse, however, it is a
necessary inclusion as a means of identifying participants. When ga is joined to the noun­
modifying particle to to make up the relative conjunction gato, ga serves to identify or mark
the head of the relative clause as a specific referential identity. Although, within the relative
clause, ga does not actually indicate that the head has been already mentioned, it does indicate
that the head is specific in that it is either known to the hearers or present within the events
being described. For a restrictive relative clause ga identifies the head that is to be modified.
Instead of meaning ‘the noun/participant that we were just talking about’ as it would in a
discourse, here it means ‘this is the noun that we are going to describe further’.


9.3.2 The function of the noun-modifying particle to
   The noun-modifying particle to (from here onwards abbreviated to NMP) serves to indicate
that a noun has been modified in some way other than by an adjective. In some cases this
modification will be another noun phrase added to give extra clarification to the speaker’s
meaning. For example:
  9.14       Wo suk-fo         to     ndam syor         ne yo,       nu-we git nde.
             but thing-taboo nmp bird cassowary det when.lRR 2PL-two eat neg
             But that cassowary is taboo, and you two cannot eat it.
   In other cases the modification is a noun phrase embedded within a locative phrase to
clarify the location further.
  9.15       M en gwa bei yamo banbo              to     Waibe ne     de    rut.
             I pl beat sago at        mountain nmp Waibe det side far
             We beat the sago on the mountain, that is on Waibe mountain on the far side.
150                                                                                   CHAPTER 9


   When a speaker wishes to give illustrations of his subject matter then sa ‘like’ is added to
to forming sato ‘for example/such as’. The noun phrases that follow sato are all embeddings
of the noun phrase which to modifies.
   9.16      Regina    ben siri        su pa        yesok sato    Am ol e
             Regina    do wrong        with child   youth such.as Amol and
             Lambertus e      sato     ye      Timor.
             Lambertus and such.as person Timor
             Regina committed adultery with (some) young men such as Amol and
             Lambertus, and such as the Timorese man.
   In all of the above examples the modification that to identifies is a noun phrase. However,
since relative clauses are also modifications of a noun, to has the grammatical role of
indicating that these clauses are embedded or subordinate. Instead of describing to as a noun­
modifying particle, an alternative is to describe it as a general subordinating conjunction. If a
conjunction can embed phrase within phrase, as in examples 9.14 and 9.15 above, then this is
certainly the best description of to.


9.3.3 goto —ARELATIVEMARKERORARELATIVECONJUNCTION?
    Comrie’s definition, given earlier, (Comrie 1989:143) that a relative clause consists
minimally of a head and a restricting clause does not seem to leave room for a relative
conjunction as a unit in its own right within the relative clause. Under Comrie’s definition, it
is necessary to place such items as relative pronouns or relative markers within the restricting
clause. For instance relative pronouns are considered clause-initial. However, since gato is
not a relative pronoun it cannot be considered as part of the restricting clause. Regarding the
particle ga this is always a part of a noun phrase. For example, it is possible to say Yohana ga
‘Yohana who I just mentioned’ or an ga ‘he, the one I just mentioned’, as described in §9.3.1
above. But this is not the case for the particle to. It is not possible to say Yohana to, for this
has no meaning. Because the grammatical function of to is to identify a subordinate structure
of some kind, it cannot stand as part of a noun phrase, but rather it is the initial component of
the subordinate structure.
   The two morphemes of gato thus enable it to behave as a conjunction or linker. The first
morpheme, ga, could be said to be actually part of the noun phrase head of the relative clause.
The second morpheme to is the initial component of the restricting clause. The combined
form, gato, therefore behaves like a bridge or linker between both head and restricting clause,
giving rise to the description stated earlier in §9.1.
                            HEAD+ CONJUNCTION- goto + RESTRICTINGCLAUSE
  This structure is similar to English relative constructions when two elements such as ‘that
which’ in ‘He knows that which he wants’ merge to the single element ‘what’ in ‘He knows
what he wants’.
   There are also other reasons for considering gato a relative conjunction and not simply
some sort of relative particle. Although the particle ga serves to identify the head, there are
subordinating conjunctions in Abun that are likewise part of the clause that precedes them
(see §11.2). They may not be removed from it. Although these subordinating conjunctions
are considered part of the initial clause and are clause-final, a secondary clause follows them
RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                                     151

because they are subordinating conjunctions. They can never be sentence-final in the same
way that to may never be sentence-final (or for that matter phrase- or clause-final).10
   Thus the relative conjunction goto is an integral part of both head and clause and cannot be
separated from either. The fact that the conjunction behaves additionally as a linker between
the two parts is not unusual in Abun grammar.11 Later, in §9.6, goto is shown to behave as a
conjunction joining two clauses, not a noun head and another clause as is the case with
relative clauses. This is another reason for considering gato a conjunction rather than simply
a relative particle.12


9.4 The COMPONENTSOFTHERESTRICTINGCLAUSE
  Besides consisting of a full clause, the restricting clause may consist of a single word.
This single word may be an adjective as in example 9.17, or an adverb as in 9.18.
     9.17      Kwa          ga        ndo     yo,      men nai,
               those.things rel       good    when.iRR 3pl take
               wo kwa            ga ibit yo           men misyar.
               but those.things rel bad when.iRR 3pl ignore
               Those things that are good we take, but those things that are bad we ignore.
     9.18      Ye-wis      Ye-nden          ye-w is      gato ketke.
               people-type people-interior people-type REL beginning
               The Bush people tribe was the tribe who (were from) the beginning.
   The clause may also consist of a single phrase such as a locative phrase, as in example
9.19, or an instrumental phrase, as in 9.20.
     9.19      M en syesyar men bi          suk mwa gato m o n u      re dakai or.
               I pl put.out I pl poss things many rel at house this just           end
               We gave out (in payment) many of our possessions that (were) in this house
               (until) there was nothing left.
     9.20      Nggon git su-ga      su    manik nde.
               women eat thing-REL with oil       not
               Women must not eat things that (are cooked) with oil.
     It is possible to have more than one relative clause modifying a head as in example 9.21.
     9.21      Yenggras gato Mauren gato kwop re anato ma         si    Yulianus.
               elder     rel Mauren rel die     this foc  come with Yulianus
               The elder whose (name was) Mauren, who died recently, was the one who
               came with Yulianus.




10    These conjunctions are described in detail in Chapter 11.
11    See Chapter 5 where the possessive marker bi is analysed as a possessive linker.
12    This is not to rule out the possibility that the relative conjunction gato may not be a true linker.
      However its overall behavioural charateristics indicate that it is a conjunction and not just a
      particle found only in relative clauses.
152                                                                                           CHAPTER 9


9.5 Relative clause formation strategy
   In any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted ‘head’ holds a grammatical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1989:147, 153). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989:147). Non-reduction means “that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking”. With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated (1989:151). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie’s list, the gap strategy.
   Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
   As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
grammatical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
For example:
     9.22      M e mu gu ye         goto man siri     su    men bi     nggon.
               I pl go kill person rel do wrong with I pl poss woman
               We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman
               from our clan).
   In example 9.22 above the restricting clause following goto contains no subject. There is a
gap between the relative conjunction gato and the verb phrase man siri ‘do wrong’,
indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject. Therefore the grammatical
relation of the head ye ‘person’ within the restricting clause is subject. Compare this example
with the relation of the relativised argument in example 9.23:
     9.23      Ji nut-bot           ye       gato j i        i-wa              ne.
               I sg thought-about person rel            I sg happy-TRS          det
               I thought about the person that I liked.
   Here there is a gap after the verb iwa ‘like’, even though the transitive suffix -wa indicates
that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye ‘person’ is interpreted as
having the grammatical relation of object in the relative clause.13


13    It is to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed in §9.5.1
      below. The determiner is more common when the head has the grammatical relation of object.
RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                               153

9.5.1 The ROLEOFTHEDETERMINER
   It was said in §9.1 above that some restrictive relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re ‘this’ and ne ‘that’ have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.
   What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
   The determiner’s role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.
   9.24      M en k i nai yu do suk      goto men y e      mo
             I pl say io refl com things REL lPL difficult exist
             re   ne, men ku re.
             perf  det I pl get perf
             We said to each other that we have the things that we needed.
   In the following examples, 9.25 to 9.27, the omitted direct object is not the final element
of the relative clause, as is the case in 9.24 above, where the determiner ne closes the relative
clause. In examples 9.25 and 9.26 there is a phrase which follows the gap, an adjunct phrase
in 9.25 and an indirect object phrase in 9.26.
   9.25      An ndo      mo j i bi    nggon subot j i  bi   buku
             3sg ask     to I sg poss woman about I sg poss book
             goto an    gre    mo bot.
             rel   3sg bum loc fire
             He asked my wife about my book that she burned in the fire.
   9.26      Pa    nut du an ben suk       mwa goto an bi    im

             duno is an.
             teach io 3sg
             The child thought that he (would) do the many things that his mother (had)
             taught to him.
154                                                                                    CHAPTER 9


   In example 9.27 below, the word ka ‘form/body’ actually is a reference to the head of the
relative clause within the restricting clause. In English this needs to be translated as ‘its
body’, so that a pronoun replacing the head is now within the restricting clause. In these
instances there is now actually no gap (created by the omission of the head) within the
restricting clause because a word such as ka refers to the head, which in this example has the
grammatical relation of direct object. This creates no need for the use of the determiner ne.
   9.27      Yen    kendo do nu-fo                 ne     nu    goto
             people call  com house-taboo          det    house rel
             ye     me ka mo nde.
             people see form exist neg
             1. People call it the sacred house, the house that must not be seen.
             2. People call it the sacred house, that people must not see the form of it.
   In all these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct object, the
determiner has not been used. The word order is sufficient to locate the gap, created by the
omission of the head, since prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these
cases the gap is not clause-final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
clause. Therefore, whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some kind within the
structure of the restricting clause, the determiner does not need to be used. So a relativisation
of the direct object may have the following composition:
                              HEAD+ goto +SUBJ+ VERB+GAP+DET
                                                 OR
                   HEAD+ g a t O + S U B J+ VERB+GAP+ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
   The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In example
9.28 below, the preposition su. ‘with’ indicates a prepositional phrase. The gap is indicated by
the presence of the preposition without the noun which normally accompanies it. Although
the gap here is clause-final it is part of the prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present,
so it is not necessary to use ne since there is another means through which the location of the
gap may be encoded.
   9.28      Suk-i      goto an kamba        su    an     ye        teker        ware.
             NOM-sick rel 3sg wear.out with 3sg difficult too.much frus
             The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it) (so that
             she could not do anything).
   Example 9.29 is similar to example 9.28.
   9.29      Yen    fro      nggumwak ga men sem mo.
             people prepare room          rel I p l sleep l o c
             The people prepared a room that we would sleep in.
   The way that the determiner is used is shown in the following summary of restricting
clause types:
RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                                     155

        HEAD= SUBJ              GAP+ VERB± OBJECT± ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
        HEAD= OBJ               SUBJ + VERB+ GAP+ DET
        HEAD= OBJ               SUBJ + VERB+ GAP+ ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
        HEAD= OTHER             SUBJ + VERB+ PREP+ GAP14
   Therefore, it appears that the main function of the determiner is to locate the position of the
gap within the relative clause when the gap occurs in a clause-final position. Usually it is by
word order that the gap is located within the restricting clause. Since the determiner acts to
close the clause like some kind of boundary marker then it is still possible to locate the gap in
these situations. Givon (1990:659-660) stated that the gap strategy is most commonly found
in languages with rigid word order, as is the case with Abun. However, he felt that
“processing rate” would be longer in such languages as well as “increased error rate, and
increased dependence on context” (Givon 1990:660ff). If there were no boundary marker, it
would not be fully clear where the gap was and such ‘increased errors’ as Givon describes
could arise. But the device of a boundary marker behaves as another means for hearers to
correctly encode what they hear. Together with the relative conjunction gato, the determiner
‘brackets’ the relative clause.15 There are some instances where some speakers will use ne to
close the relative clause even though the gap is not clause-final. It may be that they want to
add extra certainty that the relative clause is in fact closed and this is made more evident by
the ‘bracketing’ nature of the determiner.


9.5.2   A bun relative clauses a n d th e A ccessibility H ierarchy

   Keenan and Comrie (1977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie (1989:156) later refined this hierarchy so
that “The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation”. He stated that (1989:156): “if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy”.
   How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5.1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie’s
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
   Keenan (1985:156), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that “pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming rcs (restrictive relative clauses) than rpro (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies”,

14   Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but no examples with an object occur in the corpus
     of data.
15   It is our experience in living among Abun speakers that such errors that Givdn imagines rarely arise.
     Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
     internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
     which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device o f the boundary marker is
     strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
     negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
     considered as ‘bracketing’ devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.
156                                                                                CHAPTER 9


since he considered that more positions along the hierarchy could be relativised when the
pronoun was retained. Although Abun does not use a pronoun-retaining strategy, but a gap
strategy, this does not prevent a wide range of positions being relativised. There do not
appear to be restrictions on relative clause formation in Abun. However the last level of the
hierarchy, that of ‘possessor’, has limited formation possibilities in Abun. Examples 9.30 to
9.37 below illustrate the formation of relative clauses at different levels along the
Accessibility Hierarchy.

9.5.2.4 ReLATIVISATIONOFPOSSESSOR
   In §5.3 it was explained that a possessive phrase had the structure
                                   POSSESSOR + bi + POSSESSED
   In a possessive phrase the possessor precedes the possessive linker bi, which in turn
precedes that which is possessed. The following example shows that gato may follow the
possessor of a possessive noun phrase, making it possible for the possessor to be relativised.
In such structures the possessor of the possessive phrase has been omitted.
   9.37      Yan gato bi  im     mo Arlince ne               an    mu
             Yan rel poss mother exist Arlince det           3sg   go
             kagit kampung re.
             from village   this
             Yan, whose mother is Arlince, he went from this village.
   This construction although possible is not common. It is most likely to be used in
response to a question. If a question was asked, ‘Which Yan are you talking about?’ a reply
such as Yan gato bi im mo Arlince ne ‘Yan whose mother is Arlince’ is common.
However, this structure within a full sentence is not preferred. Example 9.38 below would
not be acceptable.
   9.38      *Harun gato bi ai     mo Sorom kem su j i bi
             Harun rel poss father exist Sorom live with I sg poss
             im     do-wok        tepsu an bi       pa    kon.
             mother class-small just.as 3sg poss child cook
             Harun, whose father is Sorom, lives with my aunt as their adopted child.
   Instead this statement would be given as:
   9.39      H arun gato Sorom bi       pa      ne kem su...
             Harun rel Sorom poss child det live with
             Harun, who is Sorom’s child, lives with...
   Therefore, within a full or complete sentence as in example 9.39, it is not acceptable to
relativise the possessor. In an incomplete or partial sentence, such as an answer to a question
or as a modification of a noun in apposition to a full clause (such as example 9.37) a
relativisation of the possessor is possible. It is possible to relativise the possessor only in
limited circumstances. It is not preferred as part of a complex sentence. This could be said to
confirm that the possessor position is the lowest on the hierarchy.
9.6 ‘Adverbial’ relative clauses
   In Abun the relative clause may be used with a head which refers to the adverbial concepts
of time, location and manner. In Abun a subordinate adverbial clause can be formed by
means of the relative conjunction gato. Abun does not possess adverb forms such as the
English ‘when’, ‘where’ or ‘how’, which may themselves act as conjunctions at the head of
a subordinate adverbial clause. Instead a time word, another conjunction or a locative
preposition together with gato serve as the conjunctions in these cases.
158                                                                                 CHAPTER 9


   In example 9.40 below sugato ‘with that’ has come to mean ‘the time that’ or ‘when’.
This is an adaptation of tepsu gato where tepsu means ‘like’ or ‘just as’. Tepsu gato is used
as a general, non-specific time expression in the same way as the English ‘when’.
  9.40      Sugato      Fredik si   Pontius mu watbot bus an-we
            with.that   Fredik with Pontius go examine rope 3PL-two
            ku nok        dik yo       di        mo bus.
            find wild.pig one DET.I struggle in rope
            At the time that (when) Fredik and Pontius went to examine (their) rope (pig
            trap) they found a wild pig struggling in the rope.
   Another expression used to denote ‘when’ is tom gato ‘the time that’.
   9.41     Ji nuk-bot              tom gato yen          gu yu      mo-re.
            I sg tell.story-about time rel people kill refl at-here
            I will tell about the time that there was fighting here.
   In example 9.42 below, the general locative noun nat ‘place’ is modified or relativised in
exactly the same way as the non-locative noun nu ‘house’ in example 9.43. In fact the
English translation of 9.43 needs to omit any relative marker and replace it with ‘where’ to
make good sense, but no such alternative construction is available in Abun.
   9.42      M en gwat mu-kom           mo nat       gato men gu            nok    mo.
             I pl bring go-reach to           place rel       I pl   kill wild.pig exist
             We brought (it) up to the place that we had killed the wild pig.
   9.43      M en mu kagit nu         gato men kra        su mone.
             I pl go    from house rel I pl       marry with there
             We went from the house where we were married.
   In examples 9.40 to 9.43 above the construction used to form these subordinate adverbial
clauses is identical to that of the relative clause. A head (usually a noun) is followed by the
relative conjunction gato, which is then followed by the subordinate restricting clause.
However, there are other instances of adverbial clauses where there is no identifiable head to
make the structure comparable to a relative clause. In these cases two clauses are joined by
gato combined with some other form. In examples 9.44 and 9.45 below the conjunction sa
‘like/as’ precedes gato to create an adverbial clause of manner.
   9.44      An da      ben mo    sarewo an             yo    ben kete
             3sg actual do exist however 3sg           nbg   do too.much
             bado yo        teker       sa gato nyim ne      nde re.
             maybe nbg too.much like rel earlier det nbg perf
             Although she does (these things) she does not do (them) very much, I mean,
             not like (she did them ) before.
   9.45      Nggon w e but      gre     nak g e w e sa ga ye      we but     o.
             woman two catch frog nak cl two like rel person two catch again
             The two women caught two nak frogs in the same way that the two men (had)
             caught (two nak frogs earlier).
    In examples 9.46 and 9.47 the locative mo ‘at’ precedes gato to create an adverbial clause
of reason. Here the events expressed in the second clause are the reason for the events of the
first.

                       pull Sepenyel leg then fall that
                       I laughed so much I rolled around at the eel pulling on Sepenyel’s leg (so that
                       he) fell over there. (The eel was tied onto the leg.)
      9.47            Ji    maskwa M usa mo goto an             gu Rahayu          bi     im.
                      I sg angry      Musa at      rel     3sg hit Rahayu           poss mother
                      I was angry with Musa at him hitting Rahayu’s mother.
   These types of construction can only be translated in English, not as subordinate adverbial
clauses, but as nominalised complements. Example 9.47 could also be expressed as example
9.48 below and both are equally acceptable.
      9.48            Ji    maskwa M usa we            an gu Rahayu bi      im.
                      I sg be.angry Musa because 3sg hit Rahayu poss mother
                      I was angry with Musa because he hit Rahayu’s mother.
   Perhaps in these cases the clause that follows mo gato does not represent an adverbial
clauseof reason because no conjunction which indicates reason, such as we ‘because’, has
beenused. Rather, an additional clause has been joined to the sentence by means of the
locative preposition mo in exactly the same way that a locative phrase would be joined to the
clause. In Abun, with predicates such as sa ‘laugh’ and maskwa ‘be angry’, additional
arguments may be required in the clause to indicate not the object of these predicates, but
rather the reason behind the action. If this reason is expressed as a full clause, the clause is
embedded in the main clause by the dual means of the locative preposition mo and the
relative conjunction gato.16
   In these types of example we find that gato is used in clauses that could not be described
as restrictive relative clauses. Wherever sa gato and mo gato are used they appear to join
clauses rather than modify a head. In these cases the clauses that follow gato are full clauses.
There is no gap in these clauses because they are not relative clauses. It was discussed earlier
that gato was a relative conjunction rather than a relative marker (§9.3.3). It seems then that
in its function as a conjunction gato may join subordinate clauses to larger structures, even
though these are not relative clauses and are adverbial in meaning.

   In the previous section clauses that departed from the standard relative clause type were
discussed. In this section another type of relative clause, the ‘indefinite’ relative clause, will
be shown to differ from the ‘standard’ restrictive relative clause. These types of clause, due to
the non-referential nature of the head, we have termed ‘indefinite relative clauses’ to
distinguish them from relative clauses of the regular variety. Structurally they differ from
regular relative clauses in that only the noun-modifying particle to is used, rather than the




16     The concept of prepositions which behave as conjunctions will be developed further in Chapter 12.

relative conjunction gato, and they do not require the use of the determiner, as in example
9.49.17
     9.49      Suk    to     a     ku    mone yo               a       gu        we.
               thing rel 2sg find there when.iRR 2sg kill                        away
               1. Anything that you find there, kill it (dispose of it).
               2. Whatever you find there, get rid of it.
    Huddleston terms the English equivalent of this type of construction a ‘fused relative’
construction to distinguish it from other types of relative clause. In English, a non-specific
referent is marked by some type of wh phrase, by means of whoever, what or where
(Huddleston 1984:403). Givon (1990:646) also finds these types of relative problematic
since they do not line up with his semantic definition of a restrictive relative clause, namely
“A relative clause codes a proposition one of whose participants is coreferential with the
head noun that is modified by that clause”. If the head noun is non-referential there cannot be
strict referential identity, since many of these relative constructions concern hypothetical or
unknown situations.
   In Abun the fact that these are a different type of relative construction is grammatically
marked. Abun is a language in which it is important to mark the distinction between that
which is real and known and that which is hypothetical and unknown. Normally within the
noun phrase, if any information in a sentence is not given (that is already known), the
determiner yo ‘indefinite, a/an’ is used in conjunction with the noun concerned. Therefore
Abun grammar marks the fact that nouns may refer to either actual or hypothetical entities.
When a noun represents the head of a relative clause, it is important in Abun to mark this
noun so that it can be interpreted as referring to some specific known referent or to some
hypothetical entity.
   It was explained earlier that the relative conjunction was composed of two morphemes,
the particles ga and to. In §9.3.1, the role of the particle ga was explained as serving to
identify or mark the head of the relative clause as a specific referential identity. In the types of
construction, described as ‘indefinite relative clauses’, the noun of the head has no real world
semantic referent at the time of utterance. There may be a range of possible referents but none
that is specific or known. Therefore this noun cannot be modified by ga. The simple solution
in Abun is that these nouns are modified only by the general subordinating particle to. Since
ga is absent it is obvious that these nouns have no specific referent and are therefore
interpreted as non-referential. In English the same constructions need the addition of ‘any’ or
‘ever’ to make this clear, as examples 9.50 and 9.51 indicate.




17    This clause may appear problematic from an English speaker’s perspective because it contains both
      a relative clause and an irrealis conjunction. The English translation that is given actually omits
      any reference to this. It could possibly be translated as: ‘Anything that you find there, well then,
      kill it’. As is the case with the focus particle anato (§12.6) and the mood particle w are (§4.5.4),
      there are occasions when a single Abun word is best expressed in English as a single clause. In
      example 9.49 the conjunction yo here means ‘assuming the condition o f the preceding (relative)
      clause is met then carry out the action of clause tw o’. The full English translation reads as follows:
      ‘Anything that you find there, given it is assumed that you will find something there, then kill it’.
      Further examples of this type are discussed in Chapter 11.

              class economy now cam come
              1. The captain announced over the loud speaker, “Anyone who is in economy
                class come now”.
              2. The captain announced over the loud speaker, “Whoever is in economy class
                come now”.
   These indefinite relative clauses also differ from regular restrictive clauses in that no
determiner is used. The determiner has been described as a device for assisting hearers in
locating the gap within the restricting clause, thereby decreasing the likelihood of possible
error (see §9.5.1). Since in these cases the head is non-referential with no specific referent
intended, there is no possibility of error. If there is no specific referent intended then no
mistake in encoding can be made. Hence the determiner is not needed in this relative clause
type.


9.8 Non-restrictive RELATIVECLAUSES
   Non-restrictive relative clauses are less common than restrictive relative clauses. They
have two main structural differences compared with the restrictive clause type. Firstly, the
relative conjunction is to, the general noun subordinating particle. Secondly, all non-
restrictive relative clauses must be closed by the boundary marker, the determiner ne. There
are several reasons for this. The non-restrictive relative clause is structurally different from
the indefinite relative clause in that the determiner is used in the non-restrictive type. In a non-
restrictive relative clause the semantic content ‘is presented as a separate piece of information’
(Huddleston 1984:401). It is a type of parenthetical insertion not essential to the speaker’s
main communication. It can be easily seen that in Abun the conjunction to and the determiner
ne are the parentheses which bracket the additional information which has been included
within the main clause. So the determiner is an essential element in this clause type because
the hearer must know when the inserted or additional information ends. Hence the behaviour
of the determiner in the non-restrictive relative clauses described here is consistent with its
behaviour as a boundary marker in the restrictive relative clauses described earlier. Example
9.52, given earlier in this chapter as example 9.4, shows how both to and ne bracket
additional information which has been included for the hearers’ benefit.
162                                                                                              CHAPTER 9

               Look at that turtle which is floating (around) down there!
   9.54        An ndo-bot    su-git dik yo tomen ye        bok
               3sg ask-about NOM-eat one deli rel I pl people several
               ne git su-git     ne.
               ana eat NOM-eat   det
               He asked about some (kind of) food, which all of us would eat.
   In example 9.54 there is another structural difference which may occur with this type of
clause. Because the clause is added or non-essential information, the head of the relative
clause has actually been retained within the non-restricting clause so that there is no gap, as
there would be in the restricting kind. In this example the non-reduction strategy is used
rather than the gap strategy. It may be that since this particular relative clause represents
additional, inserted information it shows the potential of inserting an entire rather than a
reduced clause. However this kind of construction has been found only within the non-
restrictive type and is not common.
   There appear to be limitations also as to those positions which may be filled on the
Accessibility Hierarchy by the non-restrictive relative clause. It appears that while both a
subject and direct object can be relativised in this way, positions lower on the hierarchy
cannot. The example below, given as example 9.28 in §9.5.1, is a relativisation of a non-
direct object for a restrictive clause. When exactly the same information is presented in a non-
restrictive form, as in example 9.56 below, it actually becomes a relativisation of a subject.18
Since the non-restrictive relative clause is the less frequent type this restriction is not
surprising.
   9.55        Suk-i      goto an kamba        su    an ye            teker        ware.
               NOM-sick rel 3sg wear.out with 3sg difficult too.much frus
               The sickness that she was worn out with, she suffered terribly (with it), so that
               she could not do anything.
   9.56        Suk-i     to ben an       ne    ben     an    kamba                  teker.
               NOM-sick rel do 3sg det make 3sg worn.out                            too.much
               The sickness, which she had, made her really worn out.



      The clause suki ben an ‘lit. the sickness did her’ is the Abun cultural way o f expressing that she got
      or had a sickness. In Abun thinking, whatever is more powerful or stronger must be made the
      subject o f the sentence.
RELATIVE CLAUSES                                                                           163

   In summary, non-restrictive relative clauses are used by speakers of Abun. There is not
always a noticeable phonological pause as in English. But speakers must bracket or delineate
the boundary of the clause by to and ne. The same information may sometimes be
structurally quite different, when put into both a restrictive and non-restrictive form, since a
non-restrictive clause may be removed from the main clause. The main clause will be able to
stand on its own, structurally complete. This is not the case with a restrictive relative clause
because it is subordinate to the main clause and its inclusion is necessary for the
communication to be complete.
  This concludes the discussion of Abun relative clause types.

                                            COMPLEMENT CLAUSES




10.1 ABUNCOMPLEMENT-CLAUSETYPES
    This chapter discusses the type of subordinate clause which has been described as
sentential complementation. Sentential complementation has been defined (Noonan 1985:42)
as “the syntactic situation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is an argument
of a predicate”. In this chapter this type of complementation will be referred to simply as a
complement clause or as a complement, but with the meaning of sentential complementation.
It can be difficult to distinguish complement clauses from adjunct clauses (see discussion in
§10.2.4). Except where it is clear that we are dealing with an adjunct, we will use the term
‘complement’.
   In Abun there are only two types of complement clause:
   1.       those that are preceded by the complementiser do\
   2.       those that do not take the complementiser.
   This chapter discusses both types of complement clause in detail and looks at further
possibilities where some complement-taking predicates are capable of both complement
types. The means of identifying complement-clause types will be shown to be found outside
the complement clause, rather than inside it.


10.2    C   o m p l e m e n t is e r   do

   The purpose of the complementiser is to identify the subordinate clause it precedes as a
complement. Abun has only one complementiser, the free-form particle do. Do precedes the
complement clause just as the relative clause conjunction gato precedes the relative clause.
According to Noonan (1985:47) “complementisers typically derive historically from
pronouns, conjunctions, adpositions or case markers...” In Abun the homophonous do-
‘some o f has various functions such as do-gato ‘the ones/those who’, do-yo ‘some o f , do-
wok ‘the small one’ and (warn) do-gri ‘the third (time)’. While these could possibly be
related to the complementiser do, another more likely origin is a verb du ‘to speak’. In the
Abun Ji dialect the complementiser is usually pronounced as du (a few speakers use dudo).
Du appears to be a verb that is obsolete, meaning ‘to say, to speak’. It is still evident in the
noun suk-du (lit. NOM-speak) ‘story, news’ and the verbs duwe ‘say, teach’, dumu ‘grumble’
and duwer ‘argue against’. In present-day Abun the verb ‘to say’ is ki, although du is
occasionally used with the same meaning. Du ‘to say’ could have become a complementiser.
This happens in some other languages. In Thai, for instance, waa ‘to speak’ has become a
complementiser introducing direct and indirect speech. As we see in the following section,
do introduces complements of predicates expressing speech and thought.


                                                    164
COMPLEMENT ClAU SES                                                                       165

10.2.1 T he use of the complementiser do
   The complementiser do may be used with a wide variety of predicates in Abun. Do is
used after predicates which express utterance, attitude, pretence, knowledge and distribution.
Any verb which expresses speaking, thinking or knowing is capable of taking a complement
preceded by do. In fact do is phonetically part of the main clause which contains these
predicates. When do precedes a complement clause, this clause is always a complete clause.
Various examples of Abun complement-taking predicates are described below.


10.2.1.1 Utterance predicates
   In Abun, predicates which express some type of verbal utterance or communication use
the complementiser do. This is the most common form of complement. The following
examples show predicates representing different types of communication.
   10.1     Ji ki do        “sane-yo       men mu sin o ”.
            I sg say com so-when.iRR I pl go all
            I said “So then, we will all go together”.
   10.2     An ki nai ye           goto w at sugit ne do           “nan syo brek gri”.
            3sg say io person rel divide food det com 2 sg                 give plate three
            He said to the person serving the food (that) “Give (me) three plates”.
   10.3      Yen    nuk        do kam       nyim      tu-ya                n d a f wa
             people tell.story com days     earlier   distant-very.distant easy for
            yen       it     mu mo gu.
            people climb dir loc sky
            People tell stories that a very long time ago it was easy for people to climb up
            into the sky.
   10.4     Nggon tu        brek ma ndo mo an dudo              “j i bi   suma
            Woman det       turn dir ask at 3sg com             I sg give what
             is nan o ? ”
             IO 2sg fqm
             1. The woman turned around and asked him, “What shall I give you?”
             2. The woman turned around and asked him, “What do you want from me?”
   10.5     An tom              su men do    “nin mukom mo-tu
            3sg prior.agree     with I pl COM 2pl reach  there-distant
            yo       nin kemkret j i m one”.
            then.iRR 2pl wait.for I sg there
            He arranged with us that “When you get there, you wait for me there”.
   10.6     An saiye do      “Yorfen a       nai j i        e t! ”
            3sg shout c o m Yorfen 2sg take I s g           subj

            He shouted, “Yorfen, please help me!”
   In Abun the difference between direct and indirect quotation is not marked in the syntax.
This difference is not achieved by a pause or absence of a complementiser, but rather a
difference in the personal pronouns used. Example 10.7 below shows an indirect quotation.
166                                                                                                          CHAPTER 1 0


The pronouns used in this example appear unusual from an English speaker’s perspective, in
that within the quotation the addressee is referred to as a ‘you’, but the speaker is referred to
as an ‘he’.
   10.7      An     tom        ji          do        “a        mu       nde yo              a
             3sg arra n g e I sg            com     2sg        go         neg   then.iRR    2sg
             kem     wade ber noru re        an      ma watbot or               e t ”.
             stay     until later night this 3sg comeexamine thorough su bj
             He arranged with me that, “Don’t go, you stay until later tonight and he would
             come and examine (you) thoroughly”.
   The use of pronouns in this way indicates that this is an indirect quotation because the
speaker is referred to in the third person. This ‘unusual’ mix of pronouns is common in
Abun reported speech. Example 10.8 below is also an indirect quote. Again the only means
of identifying it as such is by the pronouns used and not by some other syntactic device.
   10.8      Yen    kendo men do         men gwat men bi           suk     e                                men grem.
             people call     I pl com I pl     bring I p l    po ss thingsand                           I pl    put
             They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).
  The pronouns of example 10.8 are in the first person rather than in the second person,
which would be the normal situation if this were a direct quote of a request or command.
   Predicates which express force or manipulation, if they are verbal in nature, take do in the
same way as other utterance predicates. So the verbs syaugat ‘command’ and the weaker
syogat ‘order/tell’ behave as other utterance predicates when taking a complement.
   10.9      An       syaugat            men-ka-we do                  men-ka-we k i           suk-du
             3sg      com m and          lPL-C L-tw o          com     lPL-C L-tw o   s a y NOM -speak

             re       o           nde.
             th is    a g a in    neg
             He commanded the two of us not to tell this story again.
   10.10     An syogat             yenggon                      do      “a       mu    re        yo
             3sg o rd e r          m a le .n o t.s h a m a n    co m    2sg      go    th is     then.iRR

             a       gwat        mbam       su       ta k ”.
             2 s g c a rry       axe        w ith    im p o rta n t
             He ordered the man who was not a shaman, “If you are going now, it is of first
             importance that you take an axe”.


10.2.1.2 Attitude predicates
   These types of predicate refer to the state of mind of an actor in a narrative or story rather
than what that person might say. These predicates refer to various mental states such as
‘think’, ‘imagine’ ‘dream’ and ‘intend’.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                                167

     10.11     Ji    nut     do an         bi     obat       ne nggi           wa      be
               lSG   think   COM 3sg       poss   ‘medicine’ DET strong        for     later
               an    gu j i       re.
               3sg kill I sg this
               I thought that his magic was strong (enough) for him to kill me.
     10.12     Pa       we es ndam. Pa               we gen     do     an we gu         ndam.
               Child two wait.for bird    child     two intend COM 3pl two kill bird
               The two children (sat crouching), waiting for the bird. The two children
               intended that they would kill the bird.
     10.13     Ji     semda do men-ka-we            ti mo nden.
               I sg dream com3sG-CL-two stand at outside
               I dreamed that the two of us were standing outside.
     10.14    An m it do an kra          Andar to       bi   im      o.
              3sg plan com 3sg marry Andar add poss mother also
              He planned to marry Andar, in addition to her mother (who he was already
              married to).

  Various emotional states are also included in this type of predicate, such as the stative verb
maskwa ‘be angry’19, seen in example 10.15 below.
     10.15     Supanyel maskwa do       Regina ben siri          su   nje.
               Supanyel angry     COM Regina     do    wrong with people
               Supanyel was angry that Regina committed adultery a number of times.
     Likewise i ‘be happy’ may take complementiser do.
     10.16     Yen    sino i          do an kra          su    ye-gwes-wai.
               people all  be.happy com 3sg marry with PERS-leg-pass
               Everyone was happy that she was to marry a (man who was a) mediator.
   However, the verbs iwa ‘want’ (lit. happy.TRs) and bariwa ‘not want, not like’ do not
behave in the same way. These verbs do not appear to take the complementiser do. For
instance, it is not possible to say the following:
     10.17     *Ji i-wa         do j i     tu     nau        wa j i            da.
               I sg happy-TRS com I sg      bend nau.tree for I sg             drink
               I wanted that I made palm wine for me to drink.
   The correct form is example 10.18 below where no complementiser is used at all. This is
actually a complement of a different type and will be described further in §10.3.
     10.18     Ji i-wa        ji    tu      nau        wa j i          da.
               I sg happy-TRS I sg bend     nau.tree for I sg          drink
               I wanted to make palm wine for me to drink.



19    Although the verbs maskwa ‘be angry’ and nokwa ‘be worried about’ appear sim ilar phonetically,
      maskwa is actually a two-syllable morpheme containing no suffix. Unlike nok-w a, maskwa does not
      consist of a root verb and the transitive suffix -wa.
168                                                                                   CHAPTER 1 0


10.2.1.3 Pretence predicates
    There are not a large number of pretence predicates. The main verb used is kidar ‘lie,
trick, deceive’. These verbs also take the complementiser.
   10.19    An kidar nje           do    an    yewon.
            3sg lie      people com 3sg shaman
            He lied to people that he was a shaman.
   10.20    Ji     syeret     os     wa an do          Ji      farkor to.
            I   sg look.for way for 3sg com I sg study                  still
            1 .1 looked for a way (not to marry) her (and it was) that I was still at school.
            2 .1 made an excuse to her that I was still at school.


10.2.1.4 Knowledge predicates
   Predicates which involve knowing certain information or passing on information also take
the complementiser Jo. Verbs such as jam ‘know’, duno ‘advise/teach’ and tarn ‘send a
message’ come into this category and so these also take the complementiser do.
   10.21    An   ja m    do     an     karowa      ne       nde.
            3sg know com 3sg close.to              there    neg
            He knew not to (go) close to there.
   10.22    Yewon duno         subot     men       do      pa      wokgan     pa      wok
            shaman teach       regarding 3pl       com     child   young      child   small
            sye git wo-kwai nde.
            big eat fish-kwai NEG
            The shamans teach in regard to us (males) that young children and larger
            children must not eat eels.
   10.23    An       taru           do   rus ma   sor          we
            3sg      send.message   COM clan come just         because
            ye-su-go-far           yo maskwa o         nde.
            PERS-head-hair-wavy neg angry        again NEG
            He sent a message that the clan could come because the ‘wavy-haired’ tribe
            were not angry (with them) any more.
   Verbs such as ‘remember’, either napawa or napa-kom ‘remember back’ may also take
the complementiser.
   10.24    Ye-pa-sye      napa-kom       mo an             we re        do     an
            PERS-child-big remember-reach at 3 pl           two this     com    3pl
            w e ma      kagit bur   yi.
            two come from country other
            The important man remembered about these two that they had come from
            another country.
COMPLEMENT ClAUSES                                                                          169

10.2.1.5 P redicates of division
   The last type of predicate which may take the complementiser do is somewhat different to
the others. The other predicates include those of communication, mental activity, thoughts
and some emotions all of which are associated with an experiencer. However, predicates of
division require an agent. Whether the predicate expresses a division of goods or a division
of labour, the account of how the division occurred is preceded by the complementiser.
Example 10.25 describes a division of goods and example 10.26 a division of labour.
   10.25     Yen    syo do   Sara bi   nji     do-sye               ku mbre             musyu

             addition-five some
             They distributed the eastern cloth in that Sara’s elder brother received fifteen
             pieces, Sara received fifteen pieces and Sara’s younger brother received fifteen
             pieces.
   10.26     An ka-gri    ne       syo      yu      do,   de-re      ne ti        mo ros,

             count-this det stand for pull.up grass count-this det guard fire
             The three of them divided (up the work) in that, one worked on the fence, one
             pulled up the weeds and one watched over the fire.
    In the above examples the complementiser actually precedes not one embedded clause but
three. However, the complementiser is not repeated before each clause. The complementiser
is used to identify the entire complement no matter how many clauses may be embedded in
it. In the case of verbs expressing division, the extent of the division is perceived as an
intellectual activity and so the description of this is preceded by do.


10.2.1.6 OTHER PREDICATESUSINGTHECOMPLEMENTISER
   It is unusual in Abun for a predicate which involves some kind of physical action with an
agent to take the complementiser, except for predicates of division described above. There are
some exceptions to this. Example 10.27 below involves the verb sokbot ‘to look over’. Such
a verb does not normally entail a complement. However in the example below, the action of
‘looking over’ resulted in a thought and it is actually the actor’s thought which is preceded by
do. The expression ‘I thought that’ has been omitted.
   10.27     Ji sok-bot       do M oses syim ga bi nggon sap ana u              ne?
             I sg look-along com Moses arm rel poss woman cut foc which fqm
             I looked all over (thinking) that, “Which one of Moses’ arms did his wife
             cut/strike?”
170                                                                                                               CHAPTER 1 0


   In example 10.28 below the verb kadum ‘show’ means ‘explain’. Since in this case it is
acting as a verb of communication it also takes do.
   10.28     Bere j i      dakai kadum              an do             an       gwat         ji          bi
             soon I sg     myself show              3sg com           3sc      c a rry       lSG        po ss

             suk-duno      mu ki           nai ye                mwa.
             NOM-advice g o        sa y    io     p e o p le     m any
             Soon I myself will show/explain to him that he will take my message and go
             and say (it) to many people.
   Likewise, there are some instances where a statement is made and then an explanation is
made of this statement. In these instances, do precedes the explanation in the same way that
do preceded a description of a division of labour or goods. In these cases do is equivalent to
the English ‘in that’, as shown in the example below:
   10.29    Sane men kem             mo nden             ware         do       yenggras            ne        ba
             so     I pl   sta y     at   ju n g le      in .v a in   com      o ld e r .m a n     th a t    go

             re     ge             pe      men bi              suk       ma     re.
             perf   then.REAL      c a rry I pl     po ss      th in g s dir    h e re
             So we did not stay outin the bush for very long, in that the old man came out
             there and carried all our things back to here.


10.2.2 Use of do preceding less than a full clause
  It was stated above that do identified a complement and that this was always a full clause.
There are cases where do does not precede a full clause. Where this is the case, the
complement consists of a single noun phrase only. One instance of this will be looked at
under §10.2.3 ‘Noun complementation’. The following examples show cases where a phrase
and not a clause follows the complementiser.
   10.30    An bi       yenggras        nut     do     suk-i.
            3sg poss older.people think com NOM-sick
            Her older relatives thought that (it was) a sickness.
   10.31    An    gen    do ye-kampung          bado gane-yo.
            3SG assume COM PERS-village         alt   there-iNDEF
            He assumed that perhaps (they were) villagers from some place.
  In example 10.32 below the predicate kendo ‘call’ is used in the sense of giving a name.
The complement, which is the name or title bam or ‘master’ shaman, consists only of this
noun phrase.
   10.32    An kendo       do yewon      bam. An bi            ye-guru          ane.
            3pl call      com shaman     bam 3pl poss PERS-teacher that.is
            They are called bam or ‘master’ shamans. That is (they are) their teachers.
   Names are considered as complements and will be looked at in the next section.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                             171

10.2.3 NOUNCOMPLEMENTATION
   The previous discussion listed the various predicate types which may take complements
in Abun. Some nouns may take complements also and where this is the case the
complementiser do is used. Noun complementation is limited to two types: describing
names and describing thoughts.


10.2.3.1 Complement-taking nouns: naming
  In order to give a name for a place or a person, the complementiser always precedes the
name given. The noun head which takes the complement consists of an inalienable
possessive phrase of which the noun gum ‘name’ is a part. In these cases the complement
does not consist of a full clause but only the noun phrase describing the name.
   10.33    Nggon ne gum do Edia Yesia.
            woman det name com Edia Yesia
            The woman’s name was Edia Yesia.
   Only when an actual name is given is the complementiser used. Titles or social position
are not considered names and so, in these cases, the complementiser do is not used, as in
example 10.34 below.
   10.34    Erensi bi      ai      gato kwop ne tom ne            gum yesan to.
            Erensi poss father rel die det time det name chief still
            1. Erensi’s father who has since died was at that time still the village leader.
            2. Erensi’s father who has since died at that time had the name of village
            leader.


10.2.3.2 Complement-taking nouns: thoughts
   Thoughts and plans may also take complements. The conceptual thought or plan may be
expressed by means of a noun phrase, having the structure of a possessive phrase. The
complements described here differ from naming complements in that the complement in
these cases always consists of a full clause, not just a single noun phrase.
   10.35    An wa bi        suk-jimnot i      do an wa kra        Andar kagit Lamber.
            3SG FOC poss NOM-think own com 3 sg foc marry Andar from Lamber
            His particular plan (was) that he would marry Andar rather than Lamber.
   Occasionally the stative particle/verb may follow the possessive phrase as in example
10.36 below; however, it is more usual for this to be omitted. Sukjimnot ‘thought, plan,
intention’ appears to be the only Abun noun which may take complements in this way.
   10.36    An     bi suk-jimnot mo          do here an ma           gu Lamber.
            3sg poss NOM-think exist com later 3sg come kill Lamber
            His thinking was that later he would come and kill Lamber.
172                                                                                   CHAPTER 1 0


10.2.4 Complement clause structure in Abun
   When a subordinate clause is a complement, it is common for the complement to function
as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded. In Abun, complements
may function as objects of a clause and this type of complement will be described under
§10.3. However, the type of subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those
that are identified by the complementiser do, do not function in this way.
   At this stage it may be relevant to restate the criteria that determines which constituent is
the object in an Abun clause. As stated in §4.1, ‘T he direct object in an Abun transitive
clause is also encoded by word order alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised
by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb...” Since there is no case marking on
nouns, this cannot be used to identify the object. The rigid word order of the Abun language
does not allow passivisation and so this cannot serve to identify the object either. Unlike the
dative relation the object is not identified by a particular preposition. The object is
distinguished from the subject on the sole criteria of word order.
   When the complementiser is used, the constituent that follows the complementiser does
not function as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here to
support this analysis:
   (1)     A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.
   (2)     When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct object.
   (3)     Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique.
  These arguments will now be expanded further.


10.2.4.1 The db-CLAUSEMAYFOLLOWANINTRANSITIVEVERB
  The following examples show two intransitive verbs, saiye ‘shout’ and i ‘be happy’.
   10.37      An   saiye do
              3sg shout com Yorfen 2sg take lSG SUBJ
              He shouted, “Yorfen, please help me!”
   10.38      Yen    sino i     "Yorfdo aan nkra j i swt"!ye-gwes-wai.
              people all  be.happy COM 3sg marry with PERS-leg-pass
              Everyone was happy that she was to marry a (man who was a) mediator.
  In fact, as indicated earlier in §10.2.1.2, the transitive form of the verb i ‘be happy’ (i-wa
‘want/be happy about’) can never occur together with the complementiser do.


10.2.4.2 T he db-CLAUSEMAYFOLLOWADIRECTOBJECT
   In a simple clause, constituents that may follow the direct object are the indirect object and
obliques. This structure is illustrated in the example below:
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                                              173

     10.39

       Ji                ki         suk     re                 nai        yew on     mwa       ne             sino.
        lSG              say        thing this                 10         shaman many DET                     all
        Subject        + Verb     +     Object          +                      Indirect Object
      I said these things to all of the shamans.
   Example 10.40 has exactly the same structure but differs in one aspect. Example 10.40
contains a clause following the indirect object.20
     10.40

       An                ki         suk                   is    ji
       3sg               say        thing                 10     lSG
       Subject         + Verb     + Object         +      Indirect Object

         do               Nan     mu      kagit   pe           re         kekro.
                          2 sg    go      from    place        this       q u ic k ly
         Com       +                                        Clause
      He said (something) to me that I should leave this place quickly.
   The embedded clause of example 10.40 is in apposition to the object suk ‘thing’. It is an
expansion of the object or gives clear content to it. It is certainly not common to have a
structure as full as this, but 10.40 shows that if there is a do-clause it occurs after the object
and indirect object, if these constituents are present. In 10.40 the object, here suk ‘thing’, is a
generic non-specific noun without any known or specific content until the do-clause is given.
Because the do-clause is a more internally complex constituent than a single noun such as
suk, the placing of the do-clause in sentence-final position, rather than immediately following
the object, is an example of the heavy-to-the-right movement principle. This principle of
word order, evident in many languages, shifts larger complex units to the right, that is
towards the end of the sentence, to reduce burden on the short-term memory (Mallinson &
Blakel981:151, 156ff).
   Examples 10.41, 10.42 and 10.43 below are also typical of the types of sentence which
contain do-clauses in addition to direct objects.
     10.41

       Isak              ki            suk             do             A         jim           gon       bado?
       Isak              say           th in g                        2 sg       th in k      sh o rt   aqm
       Subject         + Verb     + Object        + Com         +                          Clause
      Isak said something like “Are you stupid?” or what Isak said was “Are you stupid?”


20    For the purposes of identification, the clause which the com plem entiser precedes has been termed
      the r/o-clause. It needs to be noted however that the subordinating conjunction do, although
      identifying the following subordinating clause, is actually phonologically part of the preceding
      clause. These diagrams show the main clause divided into its constituent relations, therefore it is
      not immediately apparent that do is in fact phonologically part of the preceding main clause. These
      sentences have the structure [C LA U SE 1 + do] + C O M PLE M E N T CLAUSE.
174                                                                                                     CHAPTER 1 0


   Examples 10.43 and 10.44 differ from sentences like 10.42 above. In 10.42 the object is a
non-specific noun suk ‘thing’. However, in examples 10.43 and 10.44 the object, in these
examples the pronouns men ‘we/us’ and j i ‘I/me’, is quite specific. In example 10.44, for
instance, the absence of the indirect object preposition is indicates that the pronoun j i is
actually the object.
   10.42     Yen kendo men        do    men gwat men bi              suk    e                         men grem.
             people call    I p l com I pl     bring    I p l po s s things and                       I p l put
             They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).
   10.43     An    syogat j i    do   ji     so   nyom                               wa an.
             3sg    order I sg COM lSG buy machete                                   for 3sg
             He told me to buy a machete for him.
   Both of these above examples are referred to later in this chapter under §10.4. The
transitive verbs involved, kendo ‘call’ and syogat ‘order’, belong to a predicate type that is
capable of taking complement clauses both with and without a complementiser.


10.2.4.3 TltE do-CLAUSEmay follow an indirect object or a prepositional phrase
    Abun word order is such that if there is a prepositional phrase then this follows the
indirect object and is the final constituent of the clause. If the clause contains no prepositional
phrase then the indirect object is the final constituent. In example 10.44 below the do-clause
occurs after an indirect object. Since in Abun a direct object never follows an indirect object,
it is not possible that the do-clause of this example could be considered to function as the
object of the main clause.
   10.44

 Yerom         ki                nai      yewon              do            Nan      bi     nyanggon    ne    i.
 Yerom          say              io       shaman                           2 sg     POSS   female     that   sick
                                                                                           relative
  Subject    -(J Verb       -(     Indirect                  Com       +                     Clause
                                   Object
 Yerom (a spirit) said to the shaman that, “Your female relative is sick”.
   Likewise in example 10.45 below, given earlier as example 10.5, the do-clause follows a
prepositional phrase.
   10.45     An       tom                su          men do        nin      mukom mo-tu

             yo              nin       kemkret j i            mone.
             then.iRR       2 pl       w a it.fo r    I sg    th ere
             He arranged with us that “When you get there, you wait for me there”.
   It is not possible to have the direct object following a prepositional phrase. Therefore the
do-clause in examples like 10.45 cannot be considered to function as a direct object. The
complement clause is an additional constituent within the clause linked to the main clause by
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                                    175

means of the complementiser do. It will be seen later that, in Abun, prepositions may also
link embedded clauses to the main clause.21


10.2.5 Negative raising
   When a complement clause contains a negative, it is possible in the great majority of the
world’s languages for the negative marker to be removed from the complement and ‘raised’
into the matrix clause (Noonan 1985:90). This has been termed ‘negative raising’ and is
generally possible with a limited set of predicates such as ‘think’, ‘believe’ and ‘want’.
Negative raising does not occur in Abun. There are a number of reasons for this.


10.2.5.1 Lexical restrictions
   The limitation of the predicate types which allow negative raising involve further
restrictions for Abun. Abun, in common with the languages of the Papuan region, does not
have a wide range of single morpheme vocabulary to indicate states of mind. The verbs
‘know’, ‘understand’, ‘hear’ and ‘believe’ may all be expressed by the one verb jam . The
verb ‘believe’, which may allow negative raising in some languages, does not exist as a
separate lexicon entry in Abun. Another candidate for negative raising is the verb ‘want’. The
process of negative raising changes a matrix clause verb ‘want’ to the negative ‘do not want’.
Although it is possible to change the Abun verb iwa ‘want’ to yo iwa nde ‘not want’, the
more usual practice is to use the inherently negative word bari/bariwa ‘not want’. Because it
is more common for Abun speakers to use bari rather than yo iwa nde, the possibility of
negative raising does not arise due to the choice of negative strategy taken, namely a negative
word rather than a negative particle.


10.2.5.2 Syntactic restrictions
   Since the predicates ‘want’ and ‘believe’ cannot allow negative raising due to lexical
restrictions, the only other predicate eligible for negative raising in Abun would be nut
‘think’. Examples of negative raising with this predicate are not found in Abun. The
following examples show a complement clause containing a negative as in example 10.46
and then an unacceptable sentence where this negative has been ‘raised’ in 10.47.
     10.46     Ji nut do j i          yo ku       nan gro o     nde.
               Is think com I sg NEG meet 2sg eye again neg

     10.47     *Ji    yo     nut     do j i      ku     nan gro          o        nde.

               I did not think that I would (ever) see you again.
   Example 10.47 is unacceptable on syntactic grounds. Negative sentences in Abun are
formed by two negative particles rather than only one. The dual negative particles that are


21    In §12.1 it is shown that Abun prepositions not only link phrases to clauses but also link em bedded
      clauses.
176                                                                                  CHAPTER 1 0


used in Abun must bracket or enclose the entire verb phrase (in transformational grammar
terms) or predicate (in traditional grammar terms, meaning all the constituents that follow the
subject). Because of this, any subordinate clause that is under the matrix clause is always
included within the grammatical scope of the negation. This means that although it is the verb
of the matrix clause that is being negated, the final negative particle will not occur until after
the subordinate clause. The following example illustrates this, where the subordinate clause is
of the relative type, with the negative particle nde actually occurring after the relative clause
without negating the relative clause itself.
   10.48           An yo     ki su-gato ibit subot nan             mo       nde.
                   3pl neg say thing-REL bad about 2sg             exist nbg
                   They did not say anything that was bad about you at all.
   In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example 10.47, only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut ‘think’. Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and ‘raised’ into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
‘raised’ from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.

   The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements ‘embedded’.
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are iwa ‘want’, bariwa ‘not.want/dislike’, nyuwa ‘fear’ and
nokwa ‘worry about’, all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat ‘persuade/pressurise’ and
krokgat ‘annoy/stir up’ being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
   The following examples illustrate these complement types:
   10.49           An i-wa        ji     jam     mo     an sor.
                   3sg happy-TRS I sg listen to         3sg only
                   She wanted me to listen only to her.
   10.50           An bari-wa           an jam         mo   ji.
                   3sg not.want-TRS 3sg listen         to   3sg
                   She did not want to listen to me.
   10.51           Ji      nok-wa               an
                                        maskwa ji.
                    I sg worry-TRS 3sg   angiy     I sg
                   I was worried she (would be) angry (with) me.
COMPLEMENT CLA USES                                                                                    111

     10.52      An krokgat ye          mwa maskwa yu.
                3sg stir.up    people many angry       refl
                He stirred up many people (making them) angry with each other.
     10.53      M en yo       wergat ye-w is         yi      ben-bot      suk     re     nde.

                We do not force other tribes to do these things.
    In other languages, besides Abun, a different predicate type can mean a different
complement type. For instance Givon (1990:553) states that it is “more common to find
subordinating morphemes in complements of cognition-utterance verbs, as compared with
manipulative or modality verbs”. Givon’s categories roughly compare to the Abun
categories described above. All Abun utterance predicates use the complementiser (his
 ‘subordinating morpheme’) when the complement is intended to refer to direct speech.22
His ‘modality’ predicates include the verb ‘want’, which is under discussion here, and also
other verbs which are not in the class of verbs for Abun.23 In English, attitudinal and
manipulative predicates are distinguished by having a complement of an infinitival structure.
Utterance predicates have complements which use a subordinating conjunction ‘that’. Givon
further distinguished predicates (such as English ‘want’ and the manipulative predicate
‘order’) in that the infinitival complements of these verbs could not tolerate further embedded
clauses such as relative clauses and clefts (1993:68). In Abun, these predicates likewise take
complements that are structurally quite different from the ‘utterance predicates’ and others
described in §10.2 above. The manipulative predicate ben ‘make’, discussed later, does not
take a complementiser. A predicate such as let does not have a distinct lexical form in Abun
and is always rendered as iwa ‘happy to’. Likewise the predicate oswa ‘help’, although not
a desiderative predicate, makes use of the suffix -wa to indicate an embedded complement
clause. For example:
     10.54      Sane Markus os-wa duno an.
                so    Markus help teach 3sg
                So Markus helped to teach her.
   Besides not taking the complementiser do these complement types are structurally
different in another important way. These complement types function as the object of the
main clause. On the other hand those which use a complementiser do not, as was shown in
§10.2.4 earlier. The complement clauses of §10.2 were described as fitting into Abun
sentence structure in the following way:
             SUBJECT + VERB + (object) + (indirect object) + (d o )   +   (COMPLEMENTCLAUSE)
  The complement clause types under discussion here are structurally quite different. These
complement clauses function as the object and so the sentence has the following structure:
                                        SUBJECT+ VERB + OBJECT




22    One predicate kendo ‘call’ does not use the complementiser if the com plem ent does not represent
      direct speech. This distinction will be looked at further in §10.3.3
23    These include ‘start’, ‘finish’ and ‘try’ which are all adverbs in Abun, namely sim ‘just started’ or
      ‘finished/completely’ bergan ‘alm ost’.
178                                                                                 CHAPTER   10

   Earlier, example 10.40 above was shown in such a way that its constituent structure was
fully described. If example 10.49 is repeated in the same way the structural difference
between the complement types is clearer:
     10.55

       An               iwa         ji          jam     mo      an     sor.
       3SG              want         I sg        listen to      3sg only
       Subject          Verb                Object (Complement Clause)
      She wanted me to only listen to her.
   What evidence is there to support this analysis that, when no complementiser is used the
complement clause is actually the object of the main clause rather than an additional
constituent within it? There are actually two points at issue here. Firstly, clauses like ji jam
mo an sor from example 10.55 above are actually full clauses and as such they are
complement clauses embedded in a larger structure, rather than being separate assertions.
Secondly, these clauses represent the object of the main clause in which they are embedded.
Each of these points will be looked at in turn.


10.3.1 M eans o f   identifying the complement clause in Abun

   Since this particular clause type contains no complementiser, what is the basis for
assuming that these are complement clauses? These clauses are without any type of marking
and lack some means of syntactic identification which could identify them as complements.
There is a type of complement termed ‘paratactic’ which does not use a complementiser.
These clauses are not subordinate but rather are considered as independent clauses capable of
standing on their own.24 All of the constituents which follow the predicates in examples
10.55 to 10.53 above have the structure of a simple Abun clause. For instance an jam mo j i
‘she listens to (or obeys) me’ from 10.50 and ye mwa maskwa yu ‘many people were angry
with each other’ from 10.52 are all good Abun clauses. It could be possible then to consider
these clauses as paratactic complements since they are capable of standing on their own as
independent clauses. Given that the complex sentences that contain these clauses are
unmarked to indicate embedding or subordination, what means can be used to identify them
as subordinate complement clauses, embedded within the larger sentence?
    Givon has listed several means by which complement clauses can be syntactically
encoded (1990:538ff). These various means show some type of syntactic variation by which
it can be determined that the clause functions as an argument of a predicate. One such type of
syntactic evidence he terms ‘predicate raising’ which results in forms like ‘let go’ or ‘make
eat’. Abun does not appear to have any of these forms. Another means is through case
marking of the subject of the complement verb. Since Abun is a language which lacks any
form of case marking, this is not a means through which a complement clause could be
marked. Another means again is that of a subordinating morpheme or complementiser.
Complement clause types with such a marker have been described earlier (in §10.2 above).
He lists one other means of encoding a clause as a complement clause, that of verb
morphology or finiteness. In these cases, the complement clause is usually reduced with the
verb not taking a subject and the verb morphology being distinct from that found in

24    See Noonan (1985:59-60) for a discussion on this.
COMPLEMENT C IA USES                                                                         179

indicative clauses. Can this means of encoding a complement be used for Abun?              Does
Abun have an infinitive form of the verb?


10.3.1.1 A bun VERBMORPHOLOGY
   Applying traditional labels such as infinitive or participial to Abun is difficult. Since Abun
lacks subject-verb agreement and various other means by which the verb may be marked,
the structural definitions that are applied to complement types of other languages (synthetic
rather than isolating languages) cannot be applied to Abun. In Abun the morphological shape
of the verb never changes. It is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not
possible to have a participial complement. Neither is there an infinitive in Abun.
   Determining what an infinitive is for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such definitions
are usually based on variations of the basic verb, showing person-number marking of the
subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is invariant since changes to aspect and
mood are carried by particles and subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an
infinitive is said to be a verb that is ‘not able to take a subject np\ this definition is also
problematic because verbs in Abun normally take a subject NP. In Abun, verbs are never said
in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for such words as
‘come’ and ‘go’ the reply is always given using a personal pronoun, usually second person
singular. Therefore ‘come’ would be given as nan ma ‘you come’ and ‘go’ would be given
as na mu ‘you go’. An infinitive cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.
On some occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted, but this is an option the
speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may allow the subject
of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with the subject of the main
clause. For example:
   10.56     Ji   i-wa         da     ron         are.
             I sg happy-TRS drink medicine Foc-this
             I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.
   This type of ellipsis is not common, as it is more usual that the subject is repeated. In
either case the form of the verb is the same whether there is a subject NP or not. Therefore it
is not possible to determine what is an infinitive verb form in Abun. Since Abun verb
morphology is always invariant it cannot be stated that Abun has a separate infinitive verb
form. Neither does it have a participial form. It follows then that because Abun has no verbal
infinitives, neither can it have infinitive complements. Therefore, this means of encoding a
complement clause by means of distinctive verb morphology is not applicable for Abun.
Because changes to verb morphology within the complement clause cannot identify
complement types, other methods need to be used.
   Givon did not list any other means of syntactically encoding a complement clause. The
various means that he has described, with the exception of the “subordinating morpheme”,
are all means of identifying the complement clause as such by some type of syntactic
marking within the complement clause itself. These means have proved unproductive for
Abun. Noonan (1985:44), like Givon, lists various ways of identifying complement clauses
one being “the external syntactic relations of the complement construction as a whole”. It
seems that for Abun the only way of identifying complement clauses is not from inside the
embedded complement clause but from outside of it. One such means is the
180                                                                                           CHAPTER   10

complementiser. If there is no complementiser, as in the cases under discussion here, there is
other evidence external to the complement clause which can indicate that it is embedded
within the main clause. There are various structural indications of subordination in Abun.
Two of them will be given here to provide evidence that these complement clauses are, in
fact, subordinate to the main clause as embedded objects. The first deals with the structure of
a negative sentence; the second concerns the transitive implications of the suffixes on the
main clause verbs found in these types of construction.


10.3.1.2 Negation of complex sentences
   It has already been shown in regard to negative raising (§10.2.5) that a clause can be
shown to be subordinate by the placement of the negative particle nde. If a main clause is to
be negated, the negative particle nde occurs only after any subordinate clause which may be
embedded in that main clause. Example 10.57 (given earlier as 10.53) is an example of this
and has a manipulative verb (verb with -gat suffix) in the main clause.
     10.57     M en yo      wergat       ye-w is      yi   ben-bot      suk     re     nde.
               I pl   neg force     PERS-kind other do-about            thing this     NEC
               We do not force other tribes to do these things.
   Example 10.58 below shows the other type of verb under consideration here, verbs which
may take -wa suffix and where the pattern of negation is the same. The subordinate clause, in
these cases complement clauses which do not have a complementiser, is within the
grammatical scope of the main clause negation.
     10.58     M en yo      nyu-wa      men mu        ki   suk-du       re     nde.
               I pl   neg fear-TRS I pl go         say NOM-say          this   neg
               We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
   The syntax of these examples indicates that these types of complement are in fact
subordinate because the final negative particle nde occurs after the complement. In order to
create two separate assertions in Abun, each clause would need to have both negative
particles in the correct positions, using a total of four particles in all rather than the two only
that are used in these examples. The presence and position of only two negative particles here
indicates that only one verb in the sentence has been negated, the verb of the main clause.
Therefore the second clause must be an embedded clause because the position of the second
negative particle nde indicates that this clause is included within the scope of the main clause
negation. Because there are only two negative particles there can be only one sentence here.
Therefore on the basis of the structure of the indicative negative, these complement clauses
are subordinate.25




25    The placement of the final negative particle is also significant in another way. In the simple Abun
      clause only aspect particles or interrogative particles may follow the final negative particle.
      Therefore a constituent such as ‘adjunct’ may not follow after the negative particle. Thus the
      constituent structure given for these sentences cannot include an adjunct and is limited to the
      pattern SUBJECT + VERB + O BJECT.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                           181

10.3.1.3 T ransitive nature of the -wa suffix
   The purpose of the -wa suffix is to indicate that a part of speech, usually a verb that is not
normally transitive, is transitive in the utterance given. Therefore -wa changes the valency of
the verb from having only one argument to two. Usually -wa changes stative verbs into
transitive verbs and some of these, namely iwa ‘want’, bariwa ‘do not want’ and nyuwa ‘be
afraid of’, are capable of taking the types of complements under discussion here. Any verb
which has the -wa suffix is transitive even if the object is not overtly stated. The following
examples indicate this:
   10.59     N u nyu nde.
             2pl fear nbg
             Don’t fear.
   10.60     Nu nyu-wa men o             nde.
             2pl fear-TRS I pl again NEC
             Don’t be afraid of us any more.
   10.61     *Nu nyu men o            nde.
             2pl fear I pl again neg
             *Don’t fear us any more.
   10.62     Ji nut     do an bi    obat nggi wa be an          gu
             I sg think COM 3sg poss magic strong for later 3sg kill
            ji    re.   Sane j i     nyu-wa sor.
             I sg this So       I sg fear-TRS just
            I thought that his magic was strong enough to kill me. So I was just afraid (of
            him).
   The significance of example 10.61 is that a stative verb like nyu ‘fear’ cannot take an
object unless the -wa has been added as in 10.60. Therefore example 10.61 is unacceptable
since an object follows the stative verb nyu. Frequently Abun speakers use verbs which have
had -wa added and omit the object which -wa implies. Normally the object is understood
from the immediate context. This is the case in example 10.62 above. The sentence preceding
the clause containing nyuwa ‘be afraid of’ has been given to show that the object is
understood or omitted. The implications of this for complement structures are that -wa
indicates that the verb must take an object and that, in these cases, the object is actually the
entire clause, as indicated in the example below:
   10.63     An   i-wa          ji     si      an mu         mo    nggwe.
             3sg be.happy-TRS I sg with 3sg go               to    garden
             She wanted me to go with her to the garden.
   The structure of example 10.63 differs from that of 10.38, here repeated as 10.64. In
10.64 the complementiser and the complement clause are not the object of the verb i ‘be
happy’ because i is an intransitive verb. Therefore the do- clause does not have the
grammatical relation of object (as shown in §10.2.4 above).
   10.64     Yen    sino i       do    an kra       su    ye-gwes-wai.
             people all happy OOM 3sg marry with PERS-leg-pass
             Everyone was happy that she was to marry a (man who was a) mediator.
182                                                                                        CHAPTER 1 0


   Because the clauses of the type similar to that of example 10.63 function as objects, they
must be understood as complements even though no complementisers are used. These
clauses are therefore embedded clauses.
   The other types of verb under consideration here are those which take the manipulative
suffix -gat. Besides wergat ‘force/persuade’ and krokgat ‘stir.up’, the verbs syogat ‘order’
and syaugat ‘command strongly’ may also take embedded complements. Of these verbs
only wer ‘seduce/persevere’ exists as a separate verb form without the suffix. When wer has
the meaning ‘to persevere’ or ‘to try to work out’ it is an intransitive verb. However, when a
verb takes the -gat suffix it becomes transitive. Because the structure of the complement
clauses involved here is identical to those where the matrix clause verb has the -wa suffix, it
is reasonable to posit a similar analysis for these complement clauses. A verb which uses
-gat must have an object and in these cases the complement clause is the object.


10.3.2 E mbedded complement clause as object
   Having shown that these complement clauses are subordinate, even though they possess
no overt grammatical marking to indicate this status, the second claim is that these embedded
clauses function as the object of the complement-taking predicate. In one sense this might
seem obvious since a complement clause is by definition a notional object of some predicate;
in the structures under discussion here it is hard to see how it might function as anything
else. Nevertheless there could be differences of opinion over the types of constituent
divisions being made for these sentences. Two examples will be shown again being
representative of the two different predicate types.
     10.65     Men yo     wergat     ve-wis       yi      ben-bot suk            re_    nde.
               I pl neg force        PERS-kind other do-about thing              this   neg
               We do not force other tribes to do these things.
     10.66     M en yo    nyu-wa men mu Id                  suk-du re           nde.
               I pl neg fear-TRS I pl         go say NOM-say this               NEC
               We are not afraid to go and tell this story.
   For these two examples, given originally as 10.53 and 10.58 respectively, the entire
complement clause (underlined) is considered to be the object of the complement-taking
predicates. Thus the object of wergat ‘force’ in 10.65 is yewis yi ben suk re ‘other tribes do
these things’ and in 10.66 the object of the verb nyuwa ‘be afraid o f is men mu ki sukdu re
‘we go and tell this story’. This analysis is in keeping with the type of constituent division
found in traditional transformational grammar and similar to that found in the more recent
version of this theory known as ‘Government and Binding’.26
   However, it could be posited that the entire embedded clause is not the object of the
complement-taking verbs but rather a single noun phrase only, namely yewis yi ‘other
tribes’ in example 10.65 and men ‘we’ in 10.66. This type of constituent division poses a
few problems. Because Abun has no case marking to put a noun like men into the
accusative, it cannot be seen whether this noun has been marked to show it is in the object


26    See, for example, the tree diagrams for sentences where the main clause verb is ‘w ish’ in Jacobsen
      (1986:40, 113, 118). The diagrams on pp.113 and 118 show the tree structure in the light of
      ‘principles of Government and Binding’ and so is a more recent analysis. The entire clause is
      handled as a single constituent S under a higher VP node.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                            183

relation. In fact there is no marking anywhere in the structure to show what is the object or
where various constituent divisions can be made. The evidence previously given attempts to
establish that these clauses function as a single unit. If this is not the case then what follows
these verbs must be two divisions: one for the noun phrase which will function as the object
and a second division for what is left, a truncated subjectless clause. This is the type of
division that is made in Relational Grammar, where only part of the embedded clause
assumes the function of direct object and the rest takes the relation of chomeur ‘unemployed’
(Blake: 1990:93ff.). It is a ‘raising analysis’ where a constituent that belongs logically to the
complement clause is said to be raised to the object of the matrix clause.
  This is a possible analysis since Abun clauses are unmarked to show any type of
constituent marking. However, on structural grounds, this analysis is not preferred.
   Firstly, with both predicate types involved, the entire clause which functions as the object
can be replaced by a single noun phrase which can operate as the object. For example:
   10.67     An k i do an kra      su j i    sare-wo       ji
             3sg say com 3sg marry with I sg like.this-but lSG
             bari-wa        an   re.
             not.want-TRS 3sg perf
             She said that she would marry me but I did not want her.
   10.68     Kapre     an    bari-wa        Rahel bi    ai      wergat    an.
             although 3sg not. want-trs Rahel poss father persuade 3sg
             Although she did not want (to come) Rahel’s father persuaded her.
   It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object, as in the
above examples, this would confirm the analysis that only a part of the embedded clause
functions as the direct object. However these sentences show that for Abun sentence
structure only a single constituent division follows the predicate. This single division consists
of the direct object. There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions
following the predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases— one a direct object and the other a
truncated clause— we are left with determining the constituent status of these truncated
clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible to have reduced subordinate clauses
which have no overt subject as in the following: ‘Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with
the rest of his work’. However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate
clauses. If example 10.66 is considered again,
              M en yo nyu-wa men mu ki                  suk-du re        nde.
              I pl neg fear-TRS I pl go          say NOM-say this        neg
              We are not afraid to go and tell this story.

what is the status of mu ki sukdu re? Subjectless constituents like this do not exist elsewhere
in the language. There are occasions when a subject may be omitted. Sometimes in narratives
where the subject is the same or a number of events is given in quick succession, the subject
may be omitted.

              People that do not yet know God’s name, we talk about (it to them), later (they)
               will know, remember (and ) be afraid of (him).
     10.70     Pa    sap su      mbam yo titi      ndo nde. Syur sa rek e,

               NEG   get.away good neg struggle struggle lo c place one d et just
               The young man struck (it) with the axe, (it)        could not get away at all.The
               stream was dry, and (it was) shallow, (and it) could not get away at all, (it) was
               just struggling, struggling in one place.
   In both these examples there are several clauses where the subject was omitted. In both
cases the omitted subject was not in the immediate context of the clauses concerned. The
omitted subject was given several clauses earlier. In example 10.69 the omitted subject
‘people’ was given only two clauses preceding. However, in example 10.70 the omitted
subject is ‘eel’ and is given four clauses prior to the first which takes ‘eel’ as its subject. It
can be seen that in Abun omitted subjects occur only in certain types of narrative, particularly
where these subjects have several actions attributed to them. In these instances the subjects
are omitted from either simple clauses or coordinate clauses. These clauses are not
subjectless embedded clauses.27
   On this basis it is concluded that a subjectless subordinate clause is not a valid clause type
in Abun. A sentence having the constituent division subject + verb + object is quite common
in Abun. However, a sentence which has the constituent division
                               SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + (VERB + OBJECT)

is not.28 In the above the embedded clause is subjectless.
   There are languages such as English which allow fronting of subordinate clauses.
Frequently, when a subordinate clause is fronted it consists of verb and object only.
However, in Abun it is not possible to front any subordinate or embedded clause. Since
fronting is not possible this cannot be used as a test of subordination.



27     An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.
28    It could be stated that the fact that subjectless constituents do not exist elsewhere in the language
      does not in itself represent an argument that they do not exist in the constructions shown here. It
      needs to be pointed out that in Abun there is not sufficient syntactic evidence to posit that a
      subjectless subordinate clause exists as a real constituent in the language, either in these cases or
      anywhere else. The only reason for positing that such a constituent may exist here is not due to
      syntactic evidence but rather to accommodate a certain theoretical position. In order to master a
      second language properly the language learner must not only master vocabulary but also master the
      syntactic patterns that are found in the language. In order to speak Abun effectively it is not
      necessary to include in one’s inventory of syntactic patterns a reduced clause of this kind. It seem s
      strange to add to the list of Abun clause types a reduced clause which does not have any specific
      syntactic marking to indicate its separate existence. This raises the question o f whether certain
      clause types should be added to the language’s inventory when the only basis for doing so is
      theoretical rather than observed syntactic evidence.
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                           185

   There is one other means of syntactic evidence to indicate that only one constituent, a
complement clause which functions as object, follows these predicate types. It is possible to
restructure some of these sentences so they can be stated as cleft sentences. For example
10.63 repeated here as 10.71 can be restructured to approximate a cleft sentence.
   10.71     An   i-wa          ji     si     an mu mo nggwe.
             3sg be.happy-TRS I sg with 3sg go to garden
             She wanted me to go with her to the garden.
   10.72     Su-ga      an i-wa             anato j i si       an mu mo nggwe.
             thing-SPEC 3sg be.happy-TRS foc         I sg with 3sg go to garden
             What she wanted was that I go with her to the garden.
   Later in §12.6 these types of constructions will be discussed further. However it is clear
from example 10.72 that, while Abun does not have a passive construction through which
the object can be identified, the means of focus that is possible by the noun modifier anato
serves the same function. If the question ‘What was it that she wanted?’ was asked the
answer would be as in 10.72. The object of the predicate i-wa is clearly located after the
focus particle anato and it is obviously the entire clause. Therefore it is preferable to analyse
these complement clauses as the object of the main clause rather than positing the alternative
structure discussed here.
   Noonan (1985:133) makes the claim that “All languages have an s-like indicative
complement type, and all languages have some sort of reduced complement type in
opposition to the indicative”. In comparing languages he posits a minimum of these two
complement types which constitute the smallest kind of complement system that is found in
the world’s languages. According to his definition, Abun has only one complement type, not
two, since all Abun complement clauses are indicative clauses. However, we would like to
suggest that Abun does have two complement types—those with complementisers and those
without (in this work termed ‘embedded’). The basis for these distinctions is not found
within the complement clause itself. This has been the basis on which Noonan and others
have made their division of complement types. This basis has come from the alteration in
structure of the complex sentence of which the complement is a part. External rather than
internal considerations have been the basis for the division of Abun complement types. In
this way Abun is different in its complement structure to other languages that have been
described.


10.4 Additional possibilities
   So far two types of complement have been described, those that use the complementiser
and those that do not. There are certain predicates which, when they take a complement, do
so only by using the complementiser. We would like to call this type of predicate Type 1.
Then there are a small number of predicates where no complementiser is used and the
complement clause is an embedded object. We would like to call this type of predicate Type
2. Then there is another type of predicate (Type 3), which is able to take complement clauses
of both types that is with and without the complementiser. Table 10.1 below lists these three
predicate types:

predicates


   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 1 have been previously analysed to have the
following structure:
       SUBJECT+ PREDICATE 1 + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECTOBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENTCLAUSE)
  This type of predicate can have a maximum valency of three, if the complement clause is
considered in apposition to the direct object.
   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 2 have been analysed as follows:
                         SUBJECT+ PREDICATE2 + COMPLEMENTCLAUSEASOBJECT
   This type of predicate has a valency of only two.
   Sentences which take predicates termed Type 3 have two possible representations:
                     SUBJECT+ PREDICATES + OBJECT+ (do) + (COMPLEMENTCLAUSE)
                                                OR
                            SUBJECT+ PREDICATE3 + COMPLEMENTCLAUSEASOBJECT
   Again if the complement clause is considered to be in apposition to the direct object like
those of Type 2, these predicates have a valency of only two but the sentence contains an
additional constituent. In the alternative structure the sentence is identical to that for predicate
Type 2.
  Examples of predicates of this third type are given below showing both possibilities, with
and without the complementiser d o .
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                             187

1 0 .4 .1   M anipulative predicates
   There are two manipulative predicates which when they take a complement clause may be
with or without the complementiser. These are syogat ‘order’ and syaugat ‘command
strongly’.
     1 0 .7 3    An   syogat j i     do j i so nyom               wa an.
                 3 sg order     I sg com I sg buy machete         for 3sg
                 He told me to buy a machete for him.
     1 0 .7 4    An   syogat pa         jogru     san.
                 3sg order     child take.off clothes
                 He ordered the girl to take off (her) clothes.
   Example 1 0 . 7 3 shows syogat ‘order/tell’ with the complement clause as an appositional
constituent within the sentence in addition to the direct object, the pronoun j i ‘I sg’. In 10.74,
however, the entire embedded complement clause is the object. In this case no
complementiser is used since a complementiser is used only when the complement clause is
in apposition to the direct object. The English translation of both 10.73 and 10.74 does not
show these structural differences, as both complement clauses have been translated using
infinitive verb forms. A more structurally correct translation of 10.73 would be something
like ‘He ordered me to do this: ‘Buy a machete for me’.
   Similar examples are given below for syaugat ‘command’. Example 10.75 appeared
earlier as example 10.9.
    10.75        An     syaugat men-ka-we do men-ka-we k i suk-du
                 3 sg    command lPL-CL-two com lPL-CL-two say NOM-speak
                 re o       nde.
                 this again NEG
                 He commanded the two of us not to tell this story again.
    10.76        Ji syaugat yen      ma      but  nin.
                 I sg command people come capture 2pl
                 I commanded you to be captured.


10.4.2 Utterance predicates
  There is only one utterance predicate, kendo ‘call’ which exhibits these two structural
possibilities. Example 10.77 below earlier appeared as example 10.8.
    10.77        Yen    kendo men do men gwat men bi                    suk e men grem.
                 people call    I pl com I pl bring I pl poss thingsand I pl      put
                 They called us to bring our things and leave (them there).
    10.78        An kendo Erensi ma            dom.
                 3sg call     Erensi come too
                 He called Erensi to come too.
188                                                                                         CHAPTER   10

10.4.3   P r e ten c e predica tes

  Another predicate that is similar is the pretence predicate kidar ‘lie/trick/deceive’.
Example 10.79 appeared earlier as example 10.19.
     10.79          An kidar nje           do    an    yewon.
                    3sg lie       people com 3sg shaman
                    He lied to people that he was a shaman.
     10.80          Erensi kidar      pa      ne    mu.
                    Erensi deceive child d e t go
                    Erensi deceived the child into going (away).
   It appears that only a small number of predicates may behave this way, exhibiting two
distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate, there appear to be certain
restrictions which limit the number of predicates capable of doing this. One restriction limits
predicates to those that are transitive. Any intransitive verb can occur only with the
complementiser present. The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givon
(1993:15) describes the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and terms this
‘referential continuity’. In describing co-reference limitations for English complement
clauses he notes (1993:16) that “The subject of the complement of a modality verb must be
co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of the complement of a
manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of the main verb” [italics his]. In
Abun, co-reference restrictions also apply but are somewhat different to those which Givon
has described for English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and
complement constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituent. In three of the above examples, 10.73, 10.75 and 10.77, the object
of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement clause. In all of these
cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced by a pronoun which agrees in number
and person with the object of the matrix clause. However, example 10.79 shows a pretence
predicate which varies in that the subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of
the main clause predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all cases where
these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English, where only in manipulative
predicates does the object of the predicate agree with the subject of the complement, as
shown in TablelO.l, this restriction is shared by other predicate types.29 Therefore it appears
that if a particular predicate can take complements both with and without a complementiser
then co-reference restrictions operate.


1 0 .4 .4 K   n o w l e d g e p r e d ic a t e s


   The predicate jam ‘know/hear/understand’ also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning ‘know’ it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam


29    In particular predicates such as ‘know’, ‘lie’ and ‘call’ which Givon terms ‘Perception-Cognition-
      U tterance’ predicates ‘no co-reference with any argument in the main clause’ is required in English
      (Givon 1993:16).
COMPLEMENT CLAUSES                                                                          189

has the meaning ‘hear’ it appears not to use the complementiser. The following examples
illustrate these possibilities:
   10.81     Ji    ja m kw e mbrur kwe-nat kra            kagit os       ma it.
             I sg hear wood snap tree-leaves crackle from path dir cam
             I heard wood snapping and leaves crackling coming from the path.
   10.82     An ja m   an      baca huruf dik huruf dik.
             3sg know 3sg read letter one letter one
             She knew (how) to read one letter at a time.
   10.83     Ji ja m    do         sangge nau            re    dom suk-ibit.
             I sg know com true              palm.wine this also NOM-bad
             I know that it is true, this palm wine is also a bad thing.
   The following example is interesting in that it contains both types of complement clause
within the one sentence. There is an embedded complement clause which is the object of the
predicate jam ‘hear’. This embedded clause contains yet another complement which, in this
case, consists of the complementiser in conjunction with a complement clause.

10.5 More ONMANIPULATIVEPREDICATES
   Earlier in §10.3 manipulative predicates which made use of the suffix -gat were
discussed. These predicates did not make use of the complementiser and the complements
were analysed as embedded objects. However, the manipulative verb ben ‘do/make’ was not
discussed because it is considered to be a predicate or a different type. Frequently ben has the
meaning of ‘do’ and so cannot be considered manipulative. But when ben has the meaning
of ‘make’ it can be used as a manipulative predicate. With this verb, as with other
manipulative predicates, the complementiser is never used. The following examples are
typical:
   10.85     Nan me su-ga            ben     an bi       pa      i      ne.
             2sg see thing-REL make 3sg poss child               sick   det
             You see the thing that has made (his) child sick.
   10.86     An ben       motor ne    kru re.
             3sg make motor that sink perf
             He made that motor sink.
    These complements have a similar structure to those that were termed predicate Type 2. In
keeping with the structural analysis discussed earlier, here also the entire complement clause
is considered to be the object of the main clause.
   Since examples from all of the predicate types have been discussed fully, this concludes
the discussion of Abun complement clauses.

                                 ADVERBIAL CLAUSES



11.1 Introduction
   Various terms are used to describe how, within a single sentence, clauses interact to form
a meaningful unit. Terms such as ‘interclausal coherence’ (Givon 1990), ‘relationships
within the clause complex’ (Halliday 1985) and even ‘clause combining’ (Matthiessen &
Thompson 1988) are among recent descriptions of what has been traditionally termed
subordination. Traditionally, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:172) state, three types of
subordinate clause have been distinguished:
     those which function as noun phrases (called complements) [=noun clauses],
     those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative clauses), and those which
     function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (called adverbial
     clauses).
Relative clauses and noun clauses have been described in the earlier Chapters 9 and 10. In
this chapter we will begin a discussion of the third kind of subordinate clause, ‘adverbial
clauses’, as they are found in Abun.
   Adverbial subordinate clauses are said to modify a sentence in the same way that an
adverb modifies a verb. Since the sentences that contain these subordinate clauses consist
minimally of two clauses, one clause could be termed the Head and the other the Modifier
(Halliday 1985:192). Usually one clause, often termed the main clause, is said to be
grammatically ‘free’ or independent. As such it can stand on its own as a single clause. The
subordinate clause is marked in some way, such as by means of verbal inflection, to indicate
that it is ‘bound’ or dependent and thus cannot stand alone as a single clause. Languages that
permit clauses to be joined in this way normally permit an alternative, termed coordination.
In these cases the clauses, although joined together in some way, may stand on their own as
independent clauses. However, there is another quite different type of “interclausal
grammatical organization” (to use Givon’s terminology 1990:864). This type is known as
‘clause chaining’ (Longacre 1985). Longacre states that languages of the clause-chaining
variety do not offer the grammatical options of subordinate-independent and coordinate
constructions. “The subordinate/coordinate distinction is irrelevant [in that there is no choice
between the two] and both are absorbed into the medial/final distinction.” (Longacre
 1985:239). To demonstrate this Longacre gives two English sentences which illustrate the
subordinate/coordinate options of a language such as English. These sentences, given below
as 11.1a and 11.1b, would not be syntactically distinct in a language of the clause-chaining
type.
   11.1 a. After chopping the wood, John carried it to his house.




                                              190
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES                                                                                   191

          b. John chopped the wood and carried it to his house,30
   Example 11.1a above consists of a subordinate temporal clause and an independent
clause. The first clause is marked as subordinate in English by means of the participial verb
form, the use of the conjunction ‘after’ and the absence of the subject. Example 11.1b is
given as an example of a ‘coordinate construction’ (Longacre 1985:239). Longacre’s
comment on these sentences, quoted above, is to the effect that a clause-chaining language
does not permit two different syntactic variants, as is possible in English. Only one is
possible. Abun is not a clause-chaining language. However, the influence of Papuan clause­
chaining languages can be seen when Longacre’s examples are translated into Abun. The
translations are given below as 11.2a and 11.2b respectively. There is little syntactic
difference between these two examples.
     11.2 a.  Yohanes p e t    kwe-gu or-ete     an      gwat mu mo an                  bi   nu.
             John     split tree-dry after-then 3sg carry DIRto 3sg                     POSS house
             After John chopped the wood he carried it to his house,
          b. Yohanes p e t kwe-gu ete            an      gwat mu mo an                  bi     nu.
             John       split tree-dry and.then 3sg bring dir to 3sg                    poss   house
             John chopped the fire wood and then carried it to his house.
   It can be seen by comparing these Abun sentences that there is no distinct subordinate
marking on the verb of the first clause in example 11.2a, which might distinguish this clause
as a subordinate clause; neither is there a subordinate conjunction equivalent to ‘after’. Abun
or ‘after’ is an adverb which, in 11.2a, compounds with the sequential conjunction ete ‘and
then’. Abun does not have an exact meaning equivalent for the English coordinate
conjunction ‘and’. In fact the only difference between these two examples regarding
constituent structure is the addition of or ‘after’ to the conjunction ete in example 11.2a. If
the conjunctions orete and ete were removed from these examples, all four remaining
clauses would be good, freestanding independent clauses in Abun.
   Therefore it appears that in common with languages of the clause-chaining type, Abun
lacks an obvious subordinate/coordinate distinction as found in Indo-European languages.
Many of the clause-chaining languages of the world are found on the island of New Guinea.
In a clause-chaining language (Longacre 1985:264)
       There is a clause (characteristically final in a chain of clauses) that has a verb of
       distinctive structure that occurs but once in the entire chain while other (typically
       non-final) clauses have verbs of different structure...Each non-final clause is
       marked so as to indicate whether the following clause has same subject or
       different subject from itself.
   An example from a clause-chaining language, Kanite of Papua New Guinea, is given
below. Because of its length, it has been abbreviated from the original example given in
Longacre (1985:266).
               (1)   his-u’a-ke-’ka
                     do-we-DS-you


30   It could be argued that strictly speaking the second clause o f Longacre’s example here cannot
     stand on its own because the pronoun has been omitted. In the Abun translation given later, this is
     certainly not the case as it is necessary to repeat the pronoun.
192                                                                                                                         CHAPTER 11

                       saki                                    finish
                              h a h w n - ' k a - t a l e t e - i m t a ’a do-it-coNJ
                       If we do this, you women work the garden, when that is finished we
                       men will finish making the fence.
   In this example, abbreviated from eight clauses to the four given here, a transition marker,
ke ‘ds different subject’, indicates a change of subject in the clause which is to follow. The
final verb of this sentence n e h i s - has a distinctive form that is different from when it is non­
final, as in the initial clause where it occurs as h i s - .
   These languages usually mark, within the clause chain, the notions of temporal overlap (or
simultaneity) and temporal succession (or sequence) as well as marking change of subject
(switch reference) (Longacre 1985:267). Abun, a West Papuan language, does not have the
verb morphology typical of a clause-chaining language. Nevertheless the notions of
simultaneity and sequence are strongly marked on Abun complex sentences.31 These
features of the neighbouring Papuan languages have had some influence on Abun sentence
structure. It is the author’s opinion that just as clause-chaining languages do not have a clear-
cut subordinate/coordinate distinction which is syntactically marked in complex sentences,
neither does the Abun language. This also is a Papuan areal feature still evident in Abun,
even though Abun verb morphology has more in common with Austronesian languages.
Therefore the adverbial clauses discussed in this and the following chapter can only be
considered as ‘adverbial’ subordinate clauses by semantic means; there is scarce syntactic
marking to indicate subordinate status.
   Traditionally, a discussion of the ‘adverbial’ subordinate clauses of a language would
subdivide clauses on the basis of the semantic relationships expressed between the clauses
such as time, location, reason, condition. In this discussion we prefer to group clause types
according to common syntactic properties, as well as considering semantic similarities. In
this and the following chapter adverbial clauses are not grouped together as subordinate
clauses which contrast syntactically with coordinate clauses. Rather, these clauses are
differentiated according to the type of conjunction that is used to link them. In Abun,
conjunctions divide into three main types—postpositional, prepositional and compounding.

31    Besides these temporal notions there is a particle in Abun which can behave similarly to a switch
      reference particle. The particle ga is used to identify the second actor or participant in a narrative.
      Since Abun is not a clause-chaining language it is not absolutely necessary to overtly mark the
      ‘second actor’. It is the authors’ opinion that this is a Papuan language feature which has
      influenced Abun grammar. The particle ga is discussed earlier in Chapter 5 (§5.2.2).
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES                                                                                        193

    There are a few other conjunctions which are used to link adverbial clauses which do not
fit neatly into the four groups listed above. Two of these are adverbials which show some
influence of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia, upon their usage. The other is a noun
modifier which has come to be used as a conjunction. This chapter will look only at
postpositional conjunctions, described as ‘tensed’ conjunctions. The following chapter will
discuss prepositional conjunctions and compounding conjunctions.


11.2 ‘T ensed’ conjunctions
   The Abun language does not distinguish a separate category of ‘tense’ for simple clauses.
Simple clauses are marked by means of particles for mood, that is for sentences which are
interrogative and imperative, for aspect, and for modality. None of these particles is
obligatory and when used is always found in the clause-final position (see §4.5 for a fuller
description of this). However, there are two conjunctions frequently used in Abun which
mark the clauses concerned in time frames in a less defined way than is normally the case for
tense marking. Foley (1986:159ff.), in his comparison of Papuan languages, uses a term
‘status’ to describe time settings which are less precisely defined than the traditional term
‘tense’. His term status can be loosely divided two ways, into ‘real’ time and ‘unreal’ time.
‘Real’ status refers to events occurring both in the past and present up to the moment of
speaking. ‘Unreal’ status is for events that are yet to occur, including not only those that are
considered certain but also only those in the scope of the possible or hypothetical. In Abun
this distinction is marked by two temporal conjunctions: sa, which is considered ‘realis’,
and yo ‘irrealis’. For Abun usage the term REALIS is used to refer to events which are already
past or are continuing up to the present time. The term irrealis is used to refer to events that
are yet to happen, are likely to happen or are completely hypothetical.32
   Interestingly in his comparison of Papuan languages. Foley distinguishes aspect and
modality (his ‘inner operators’) from tense, status and mood (‘outer operators’). Foley does
not use the term ‘mood’ but instead describes it as ‘illocutionary force’ (see Foley
1986:143ff.). In Papuan languages aspect and modality are usually indicated in some way on
the verb stem and are part of the predicate. But tense and the other ‘outer operators’ tend to
be realised grammatically in different ways, on the sentence level. While Abun has not been
classified as a Papuan language but is rather a West Papuan language, nevertheless this
generalisation made for Papuan languages appears to have some significance. In Abun,
aspect and modality particles are always part of a single clause. Status, that is the difference
between realis and irrealis time, occurs only at the complex sentence level. In this way there
appears to be a distinction in that the concepts of reads and irrealis are not marked on the
individual clause in Abun, as is commonly the case in many languages, but are marked on
the sentence by means of a conjunction.
   The usage of these two ‘tensed’ or temporal conjunctions in Abun sentences is compared
below.



32   It may appear confusing to use Foley’s definition of the terms R E A L IS and IRREALIS since these terms
     are often used to describe not tense, but mood (for example see Givon 1984:255). However,
     Foley’s term ‘status’ which he divides further into ‘realis’ and ‘irrealis’ closely approximates the
     semantic distinction between the two postpositional conjunctions sa and yo.
194                                                                                  CHAPTER 1 1


11.2.1 T he realis conjunction sa
   When a language indicates the temporal setting of events expressed within clauses it may
do so by a formal grammatical category tense, by time words or a combination of both
strategies. In regard to complex sentences, tense as a category may be marked within the
component clauses and particular conjunctions may convey particular ‘marked’ time
meanings, such as ‘before’, ‘after’, ‘as’, and ‘while’. The Abun conjunction sa carries the
grammatical information of ‘realis’, but in relation to specific time concepts is unmarked.
Thus it could be considered a general time subordinator and translated into English as
‘when.realis’. Sa indicates that the clauses it joins are in realis time setting. By usage of sa
hearers know that the connected events expressed by the clauses are in the past, that they
have already occurred. When clauses are joined by sa, speakers usually pause after sa,
indicating that sa is considered to be part of the preceding clause. Nevertheless sa is still a
conjunction or means of joining two clauses in Abun. It is not possible to end a sentence
with sa. Therefore clauses marked by sa are dependent temporal clauses in the same way as
the English ‘when’ clause. Sa is a sentence-medial subordinating conjunction and is a
constituent of the first clause of a complex sentence which has the following structure:
                                    [CLAUSE 1 + 5a] + CLAUSE2
   The following examples are typical of the way sa is used in Abun:
   11.3      Men kem mo kampung sa                       Rahel bi       ai farkor an.
             I pl stay in     village      when.REAL Rachel poss father teach 3sg
             When we stayed in the village, Rachel’s father taught her.
   11.4      M ensem monekret          Marten sa            Marten ma   kam Selasa.
             I pl sleep there wait.for Marten when.REAL Marten come day Tuesday
             We slept there, waiting for Marten and he came on Tuesday.
   As a general time subordinator the range of meanings conveyed by sa is wide. Sa is a
temporal link between clauses and as such can be used to indicate the following range of
meanings:
                 (1) precedence            when/before
                 (2) subsequence           when/after
                 (3) simultaneity          when/while
                 (4) point coincidence     when/as/, just then
   Givon describes a general subordinator such as sa as being semantically ‘less marked’.
Conjunctions such as ‘before’, ‘after’, ‘while’ and the like are considered to indicate ‘specific
temporal relations’. Therefore Givon (1990:828) considers that “Such less-marked coding
strategy is successful when the semantic specificity of the temporal relation can be inferred
from other features of the two clauses - most commonly from the verb and its tense-aspect.”
Since in Abun the conjunction itself indicates the ‘tense’ or time setting, it is not necessary to
use other means in order to indicate the specific temporal relation concerned. In the examples
below the extent of temporal relations that sa can convey is shown together with more
specific means of indicating these.

11.2.1.1 P recedence ‘when/before’
     11.5       M e-ka-w e gwat ma-kom      mo nu    sa                             ge

                gri    kwop re.
                three die perf
                1. When we carried (them) up to the house, three (fish) had already died.
                2. By the time we reached the house three had already died.
     11.6       Ji ma        sa           an yo ma            nde to.
                I sg come when.REAL 3sg nbg come neg incam
                1. When I came he had not yet arrived.
                2. By the time I came he had not yet arrived.
   The above examples indicate temporal precedence, which in many languages is indicated
by a specific time word meaning ‘before’. Abun has no single word which can be translated
as ‘before’. Instead the negative particle nde combined with the incompletive aspect particle
to are used to indicate ‘not yet’. In the above examples there are two further means of
inferring the time relation in addition to the conjunction itself. Example 11.5 has the second
clause marked by the perfect aspect particle.33 In example 11.6 the temporal precedence
relation is more explicitly marked by nde to ‘not yet/before’ again on the second clause.
These particles may behave as a conjunction without the need for the general subordinator sa.
If used in a clause within a complex sentence nde to has the specific meaning of ‘before’.
For example:
     11.7      Tepsu gane j i      yo fa i  Apner nde to,   Apner                            dom
               just.like then I sg neg know Apner neg incam Apner                            also
               yo     fa i   ji      nde.
               NEC know lSG NEG
               1. At that time before I knew Apner, he did not know me either.
               2. At that time I did not yet know Apner, he did not know me either.


11.2.1.2 Subsequence ‘when/ after’
     11.8      M en ma    mo kampung sa                   men nai yor.
               I pl come to      village     when.REAL I pl     take spears
               When we came to the village, we took the spears.
     11.9      M en wat-bot           or      sa          an hi                   do...

               1. When we had finished examining (her), he said...
               2. After we had examined (her) he said...
   In the above examples only one has any specific indications of the temporal relations
involved. The word or has several meanings including ‘finished’, ‘completely’ and ‘empty’.
In example 11.9 or has the meaning that the action is finished and within a complex sentence


33    There is no need to mark the first clause for aspect since the meaning o f sa is similar to that of the
      perfect aspect particle re.
196                                                                                       CHAPTER 11


o r can have the connective meaning of ‘after’ (as in example 11.2a at the beginning of this
chapter). It is not necessary to use the general subordinator s a when the temporal relation of
subsequence is intended. For example:
     11.10     Y ew on    ne  ben su k       ne     or   yen     m a.
              shamans det do things det after people come
              After the shamans did those things, the people came.


11.2.1.3 Simultaneity ‘when/ while’
     11.11    An kra       Lamber sa            an-we      ku pa      dik sor re.
              3 s g marry Lamber     when.REAL 3PL-two get child one only PERF
              1. When she was married to Lamber, they only had one child.
              2. While she was married to Lamber, they only had one child.
     11.12    M en    gwa bei mo sa               yen      ki kabar ma        do...
              I pl pound sago exist when.REAL people say news come com
              1. When we were pounding sago, people brought some news that...
              2. As/while we were pounding sago people brought some news that...
     11.13     Ye        we ma sa              ye        we but      gre nak              we.
               person two come when.REAL person two catch frog nak                        two
               1. When the two were coming, they caught two nak frogs.
               2. As the two were coming (along) they caught two nak frogs.
   The three examples above all show temporal simultaneity. As noted previously, in
common with other Papuan languages, temporal simultaneity is strongly marked in Abun
grammar. Besides the usage of the conjunction sa to indicate simultaneity, a compound
form, sare-sa, is used to emphasise a simultaneous relationship between clauses. The
compound is created by the addition of the adverb sare ‘like this’. The adverb sare is itself a
compound consisting of the adverb sa ‘like’34 and the determiner re ‘this’. When sare is
used immediately after a verb it can convey a continuous or repetitive meaning to the action
of the verb. For example:
     11.14     Wermus titi         sare ma ket         yamo kampung tore.
               Wermus run.away kept.on DIR west          lo c village    here
               Wermus kept on running away (or making his escape) westward, towards the
               village here.
   Therefore on some occasions sare is joined to the conjunction sa to form saresa ‘as,
while’, a conjunction which more specifically indicates the simultaneous relationship
between the clauses joined.
     11.15     Ji kani           ret         nden saresa       j i sokme Isak ram.
               I sg look.around random        land while     I sg see      Isak move
               As I was looking about everywhere, I saw Isak (moving) in the distance.




34    The adverb sa is homophonous with the conjunction sa. As an adverb it rarely appears as a free
      form. It is normally part of a compound such as sare ‘like.this’, sato ‘for exam ple’, and sagana
      ‘usually’ However it does appear as a free form in the interrogative sa u? ‘like how ?/how ?’
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES                                                                                   197

   For more exact simultaneity of the time relationship between two clauses Abun has
another way of expressing this, which is not by means of a conjunction. When the speaker
intends to convey that the events of both clauses occurred at the same time then the clitic -i is
added to both clauses. For precise simultaneity sa is not used, being too general in
meaning.35
     11.16      Suk-bo            ba-i         an    sap    yu-i.
                th in g -fru it                 3pl strik e refl - sim

                At the time the bell was ringing they were cutting into each other.


11.2.1.4 Point coincidence ‘when/just a s ’
     11.17     Ji    ma     sa             nu    or    yen      mu re.
               I sg come when.real house empty people go perf
               1. When I came, the house was empty, everyone had gone.
               2. By the time I came, the house was empty, everyone had gone.
     11.18     An ndo mo pilot sa                    yesan desa su-gane              ma.
               3sg ask     at pilot when.REAL chief area with-that                   come
               He was asking the pilot, just when the local area chief came.
  Apart from the conjunction sa, this temporal relationship can be indicated by the time
word sugane ‘at that time/then’ which occurs in 11.18.


11.2.1.5 sa-   realis ‘c o n d it io n a l ’

   The conjunction sa is most commonly used as a general temporal subordinator as
described above and as such would best be translated into English as ‘when’. However, sa
can also be extended in its meaning to include the semantic concept of condition and also to
include subjunctive modality. Longacre (1985:265), in describing clause-chaining languages,
states that “Temporal relations appear to be central in these languages and are extended
metaphorically in other directions.” Certainly in regard to the conjunction sa, which normally
functions as a temporal subordinating conjunction, its usage can be extended to include the
notion of condition. Abun has no single lexical item that could be translated as ‘i f . There are
a number of ways that the semantic concept of ‘condition’ is conveyed in Abun. One of
them is by means of the conjunction sa used together with the time words be/bere
‘later/will/future’. When the second clause of the complex sentence containing sa is marked
by be/bere, the sentence has the same meaning as a conditional sentence and can be
translated as ‘if...then’. Also in some cases these sentences could be translated in a way that
could be considered as ‘subjunctive’.36 Because sa is a conjunction which conveys time
setting or ‘tense’, these sentences, although referring to hypothetical events, must be marked
as being in the past. It could be stated that a past tense or realis ‘conditional’ conjunction is a


35    The fact that Abun grammar can mark the temporal notion o f simultaneity in three overt ways, by
      the conjunctions sa and saresa and by the clitic -i, indicates the gram matical importance of this
      notion.
36    The notions often termed ‘subjunctive’ are more em phatically conveyed by the compound
      conjunction sane-sa ‘had that been the case’. This conjunction is discussed in the following
      chapter, §12.5.
198                                                                                   CHAPTER 11


contradiction in terms. However, because Abun does not overtly mark the notion of
conditional by means of a morpheme, other strategies are used to convey this notion. One
means is by the combination sa + be which results in a conditional sentence in a past or
realis time setting.
   11.19      Ji      me su        ji    gro    dom sa              be    ji jam.

              1. If I had also seen with my eyes then I would have believed.
              2. Had I seen with my eyes also I would have believed.

              But if they had not set up the shaman training school they would be still killing
              each other, don’t you think?


11.2.2 The irrealis conjunction yo
    In the previous section the conjunction sa was described as a temporal subordinating
conjunction which could be rendered as ‘when’ in English. Sa was described as a ‘realis’
conjunction because its usage indicates a past time setting for the clauses that it links. In the
same way the conjunction             yo is also atemporal conjunction. It       alsomayberenderedin
English as ‘when’. However, yo differs from sa in that it is an irrealisconjunction. Any
sentence marked by yo has an implied futurity. The meaning of yo contrasts with that of sa
in that the events of clauses joined by yo have the meaning of future time, are possible events
in the future or are completely hypothetical events, that is ‘when.irrealis’. In Abun yo is
used in basically four ways:
  1.   To   express intent or plans ‘when(future)...(then)’
  2.   To   describe procedures in hypothetical situations ‘when(hypothetical)...(then)’
  3.   To   describe conditions in general hypothetical situations ‘if/whenever...(then)’
  4.   To   describe a compulsory consequence following a condition *if...then(must)’
  The following examples illustrate the way yo is used in Abun.


11.2.2.1 To express intent, desire or future plans ‘when(future)...(then)’
   11.21     A    so a bi       suk   it     yo,         a gwat more kret          ji.
             2sg buy 2sg POSS things CAM when.iRR 2sg bring here wait.for me
             When you (will) have bought (all) your things, then bring them here and wait
             for me.
              M e-ka-we mu-kom         mo    u              yo            ji     mori
              lPL-CL-two go-reach      to    where.iNDEF     when.iRR     I sg   behind
              a    wadikgan mu nyim.
              2sg alone       go     ahead
              When we two get there, I will stay behind, you go ahead by yourself.
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES                                                                          199

   Sentences of the above type where the speaker indicates future movements, plans,
intentions and so on, are always marked by the irrealis conjunction yo. It is not necessary to
mark any of the clauses within the sentence with the time words be/bere ‘later/future’. For a
single clause only these words would be necessary to mark this clause for future time. In the
example below, which consists of two independent clauses, it is necessary to mark the
second clause with the temporal word be ‘future/will’.
   11.23     Ji ben j i bi       suk i.       Be a ma        kon       j i e?
             I sg do   I sg poss thing own fut 2sg come look.after I sg fqm
             I do my own thing. Will you later come and look after me?
   For a complex sentence, however, the conjunction yo indicates the same meaning. It is not
possible for a single clause to be marked by yo, because yo is a conjunction. Like sa, yo goes
with the first clause of the complex sentence and not the second.
   11.24     A jam suk        ba            it    yo       men mu it ane.
             2sg hear thing make.noise cam when.iRR I pl go cam then
             When you hear the bell ring, we will go then.


11.2.2.2 Procedural situations ‘when (hypothetical)...(then)’
   11.25     Ye     syesyar pa        mo nu       yo,          ye      mwa ma.
             people go.out    youths uoc house when.iRR people many come
             When they take the young men out of the house (then) many people come.
   11.26     A go        ndam-som yo               a     gwim i-da           we      kadit.
             2sg cut.up bird-som      when.iRR 2sg peel poss-skin away from
             When(ever) you cut up a bat, (then) you peel its skin away from (its body).
   Descriptions of procedures are hypothetical in nature and not fixed in any particular time
setting. Therefore, as in the above examples, clauses are linked by the irrealis conjunction yo
to indicate that the events expressed within complex sentences are not actual events but
possible ones.

   11.29     An we bi     nyanggon-i           sem yo         an  we sem.

             An we bi       nyanggon-i            mu yo           an   we mu.
             3pl two poss female.relative-poss go when.lRR 3pl two go
             When their female cousin slept then those two slept. When their female cousin
             went then those two went.
   Examples 11.27 and 11.28 above show hypothetical situations which could happen at any
future undisclosed time. These hypothetical situations could aptly be translated by
‘whenever’. Thus yo, here translated as ‘when’ in English, could also be translated as ‘i f for
these irrealis sentences. Givon (1990:830) notes that, “In many languages, irrealis
conditionals are marked identically as irrealis w/ien-clauses, so that the slight difference
between them is inferred from the context.” This is the case for Abun. Examples 11.30 and
11.31 below are irrealis conditional sentences and are marked by yo to express the
conditional relationship between the clauses.
   11.30     Nan i          yo           men to Barbarina si                nan kem.
             2SG happy when.lRR I pl             add Barbarina      with 2sg live
             If you are happy (about it) we will send Barbarina to live with you.
   11.31     Wo pa             yo   me suk      nde to          yo,           here syogat...
             but young.men neg see things nbg incam when.lRR fut order
             But if the young men haven’t seen anything, (then) they order...
   It was stated earlier that Abun has no single lexical item to represent a conditional
relationship between clauses. The tensed conjunctions sa and yo can be used to express this
relationship but often no conjunction will be used at all. In the following example the first
clause expresses a current state so that the time setting is neither past nor future. Here neither
sa nor yo have been used to link the two clauses. There is no linker at all. The two clauses are
juxtaposed and the conditional relationship that is expressed is inferred by the hearer from the
known context.
   11.32     Nan bambri j i        be    ji   ben obat              mo a       kwop go!
             2sg not.care I pl fut I pl do           black.magic on 2sg die           ass
             (10 you are not going to marry me, (then) I will kill you with sorcery, so there!
   The conjunction yo is also used to link other clauses that could be described as
‘hypothetical alternatives’. Abun has no single lexical item that represents alternation such as
the English ‘or’. In questions often bado ‘alternative question marker’ is used. In a complex
sentence involving several alternatives yo may be used where the situation is not fully known
and therefore hypothetical in some way. In such instances yo is best translated as ‘whether’.
             An     mewa         an    bi      nggon      ndo yo        ibit
             3sg    look.after   3sg   poss    woman      good when.lRR bad
             yo        men jam       nde.

             Whether he looks after his wife well or badly, we do not know.

11.2.2.4 Compulsory consequence ‘if...then (must)’
   It has been shown that yo is used within sentences to express the future time setting of
those sentences, to express possible events or hypothetical ones and also to express a
conditional relationship between two clauses. It can also be used to link clauses where the
event expressed by the second clause is a compulsory consequence of the event expressed by
the first. These types of sentences are always hypothetical in nature, yet the additional link of
consequence is contained within the meaning of the complex sentence. For example:
   11.34     Ye-to      gwa yewon dabeyo,                  ye       ne
             person-REL hit shaman earwhen.lRR          person that
             bi denda su mbre.
             pay fine      with eastem.cloth
             Whenever someone hits a shaman on the ear, that person must pay a fine with
             antique cloth.
   11.35     Suk-to    a ku       mone yo          a    jam       a gu we sor.
             thing-REL 2sg find there when.lRR 2pl know 2sg kill off just
             Whatever you find there, you know you must just kill (it).


11.2.3 C onstituent status of sa ANDyo
   When both of these ‘tensed’ conjunctions mark a sentence they modify the first clause of
the sentence only. Thus these sentences have the following structure:
                                [clause 1 + sa / yo\ + clause 2
   Because a single clause cannot be modified by a grammatical category ‘tense’, sa and yo
are considered subordinating conjunctions. These ‘tensed’ conjunctions behave differently to
other Abun conjunctions in that they are postpositional. Prepositional and compounding
conjunctions such as we ‘because’ and wo ‘but’ do not behave this way. This is to be
expected since Abun is a language with svo word order and has prepositions. The ‘tensed’ or
temporal conjunctions sa and yo depart from this. In fact in vo word-order languages
generally “the connecting morpheme appears clause-initially — in the following clause”
(Givon 1990:889). These conjunctions being postpositional illustrate characteristics often
found in ov languages. Because these two conjunctions show a difference in syntactic
behaviour to other Abun conjunctions they are considered to be in a separate subclass to the
others.
    The two final examples show clearly that while both conjunctions have several meanings
in Abun, the predominant meaning is to give a time setting to the sentences concerned. The
first clause of each sentence is almost identical to the other except for the choice of
conjunction. The meaning difference is that the events expressed by example 11.36 had at
that stage not yet taken place (being in the middle of a narrative); whereas sentence 11.37
(given earlier as example 11.20) expresses events already concluded and is in fact a
summary statement at the end of the same narrative. Therefore it is by the means of two
subordinating conjunctions that hearers can identify the time settings of Abun sentences.

                      PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS



1 2 .1    In t r o d u c t io n

   In the previous chapter adverbial subordinate clauses, which were linked to the larger
sentence by means of postpositional conjunctions, were described. In Abun, clauses are
linked to form complex sentences in one of three ways—by means of postpositional
conjunctions, by means of prepositional conjunctions or by means of compounding
conjunctions. Clause types in Abun can be classified according to which type of conjunction
is used, rather than a subordinate/coordinate distinction which depends upon clause-internal
syntactic differences. In this chapter, the usage of prepositional conjunctions and
compounding conjunctions within sentences will be described. These types are grouped
together according to their common syntactic properties. Table 1 2 . 1 below outlines these
groups and lists the common syntactic features that distinguish them from each other. There
are a small number of conjunctions which do not fit neatly into these three groups. These
‘exceptions’ have not been included in Table 1 2 .1 but are also discussed in this chapter.

12.2 T he preposition as conjunction
   Traditionally prepositions and conjunctions have been considered as two separate word
classes within a language. Recently Huddleston (1984:338) has proposed, at least for
English, that prepositions and subordinating conjunctions be conflated into a single class
(1984:338). Some of the reasoning behind this (1984:339) that is applicable to Abun as well

                                                       203

as English is that a number of these words “enter into construction with either an NP or a
clause”. Abun prepositions behave like conjunctions in that a large number of the class of
prepositions have the ability to link a clause to a larger construction. Where they differ from
the other conjunction groups listed in Table 12.1 is in their ability to embed clauses within
larger units. It will be shown later that other conjunctions in Abun link independent clauses.
These conjunctions have been described as compounding conjunctions because of their
ability to create new forms and extend their range of meaning.
   The following Table 12.2 lists those Abun prepositions that behave also as conjunctions.
For some, when they are used to link a clause rather than an np, their original meaning is
extended.

            SU                  with INSTRUMENT               with


   The majority of Abun prepositions may act as conjunctions. However, the general locative
mo ‘at/in’ can be used only in association with the relative clause marker goto?1 Some of the
prepositions such as subot ‘along’ karowa ‘close to/near’ and su ‘with’ are not commonly
used as conjunctions. Examples of those that are more commonly used, both as prepositions
and as conjunctions, are given below:
(i) ‘wa’ ‘for/in order to’
     12.1        An fro          nu     yo    wa       men.
                 3sg prepare house det(i) for          I pl
                 She prepared a house for us.
     12.2        Marta tot su-gato gum do brer gwat ma wa mengit sugit mo.
                 Marta cut thing-REL name com brer bring dir for I pl eat food on
                 Marta cut some brer (leaves) and brought them back for us to eat our food on.
   The clause that follows the preposition wa in example 12.2 above is considered as a single
constituent. As discussed in Chapter 10 earlier, there is no non-finite form of the verb in
Abun, thus men git sugit mo represents a single clause.




37    Examples o f these are in §9.3.

             Kasuwari      wa men sem mone.
             Cassowary for I p l s l e e p t h e r e
             Mister Cosmus turned the head of the canoe towards the shore at Cassowary
             Point in order for us to sleep there.
   Since wa is a preposition, if a clause containing wa is negated the prepositional phrase is
included within the negation. For example:
   12.4      Yenggras yo        ki   nggon     yo      wa j i     nde.
             elders      neg   say women d e t .( i ) for I s g n e g
             The elders did not speak to any women for me (to marry).
   Likewise if wa links a constituent that is as large as a clause, this clause is also included
within the scope of the negation of the main clause verb. Example 12.5 below illustrates this:
   12.5      M en yo     ku oto wa men bes men bi                   suk                                          yo        mo      nde.
             I pl        find car for I p l lift I p l p o s s thing
                         neg                                                                                     nbg       exist   nbg

             We did not find any cars to carry our load (for us) at all.
   In §10.2.5 earlier it was shown how a clause can be considered as subordinate by the
placement of the final negative particle nde. If a main clause is to be negated, the negative
particle nde only occurs after any subordinate clause which may be embedded within the
larger sentence. Thus clauses joined by wa are embedded clauses within a larger sentence. So
in example 12.5 above the preposition wa is used to link the clause men bes men bi suk ‘we
load our things’ to a larger sentence. The placement of the negative particle nde as sentence-
final indicates that this clause is in fact embedded.
   The following example is even more complex. The verb of the main clause is negative
and, as is the case with main clause verbs in Abun, the second negative particle cannot occur
until after any embedded clauses which are governed by the main clause. In this example
there are three embedded clauses, one a relative clause and two that are embedded by means
of wa, showing that wa is also recursive in nature. To add to the complexity the main clause
is also an interrogative. Again, like the final negative particle, the interrogative marker e
occurs after the embedded clauses.

(v) sude/su-bere ‘so that’
   This conjunction is made up of the preposition su ‘with’ and the time word here
‘FUTURE/later’. As regards the dialect variant sude, no meaning component has been elicited
for -de. Speakers that use sude often add be re indicating that this conjunction is used with
events not yet realised. Sude is not used to link a noun phrase to a clause, so in this way it
could not be described as a preposition. However, it is the authors’ opinion that the form
sude is derived from the preposition su ‘with’ and so it has been included here with other
prepositions.

             If you find some ginger root then keep it (here) so that I can go and get Sem
             soon (so that he can use the ginger root).
   In a language like English, adverbial subordinate clauses can be distinguished from
coordinate clauses in that the subordinate clause is not fixed in its position within the
sentence. The subordinate clause may be either pre-posed, that is sentence-initial, or post-
posed, that is sentence-final. Such flexibility of sentence position is not possible in Abun.
Therefore in Abun, the ability to pre-pose or post-pose an adverbial clause is not an indicator
of subordination. As has already been discussed earlier (§10.3.1.1), there is no non-finite
verb form that can be used to signify that a clause is subordinate. However, the placement of
the final negative particle is an indicator in Abun that a clause is embedded within a larger
sentence. By this means clauses that are linked to larger clauses by prepositions can be
shown to be subordinate, as in examples 12.5 and 12.6 above. However, prepositions and all
conjunctions in Abun are sentence-medial. A clause together with its linking conjunction
cannot be fronted or pre-posed as is possible in a language like English. It has been claimed
(Givon 1990:844) that “All languages seem to allow the pre-posing of ADV-clauses”. This is
not the case for Abun and therefore this cannot be used as an indicator of subordination.


12.3 Compounding conjunctions
   The most striking feature of this second group of conjunctions is indicated by their
name— ‘compounding’ conjunctions. From three ‘base’ forms— we ‘because’, wo ‘but’ and
te ‘then’— a total of eight other compound conjunctions are created. This feature, the ability
to act as a base form within a compound, is a significant syntactic feature which can be used
to identify these three conjunctions as a distinct group or subclass in Abun. Before the extent
of these compounding possibilities is discussed, another syntactic feature common to these
compounding conjunctions will be discussed first.
     Unlike prepositional conjunctions, the conjunctions termed ‘compounding conjunctions’
do not have the ability to embed a clause within a larger unit. These conjunctions link two
independent clauses together to form sentences which cannot be easily described by the
traditional labels of subordinate or coordinate. In Chapter 11 it was explained that Abun has
little syntactic evidence to support a subordinate/coordinate division of complex sentences.
This is most likely due to the influence of Papuan clause-chaining languages which also do
not have this division. In fact many languages, not only Abun, (Givon 1990:848) “do not
make a clear morpho-syntactic distinction between coordinate and subordinate clauses”. At
208                                                                                                           CHAPTER 1 2


first glance, sentences which contain these conjunctions appear no different to those where a
preposition is used as the means of clause linkage. To show this several sentences are given
below. The first two, given earlier as examples 12.3 and 12.8, use the prepositions wa ‘for’
and tepsu ‘like/same as’. Examples 12.18, 12.19 and 12.20 show we ‘because’, wo ‘but’
and te ‘then’ respectively.
     12.16     Yenggras Cosmus brek kwem su mu nden mo tanjung
               mister   Cosmus turn canoe head d ir land to point

               Mister Cosmus turned the head of the canoe towards the shore at Cassowary
               Point in order for us to sleep there.
     12.17     A       napawa             pe      tepsu         jam-biro kom             mo kwe-guk.

               You remember (this) closely just like the biro vine clings closely to the branch
               that it grows on.
     12.18     Nan ben suk         re kekro we           men mu mo Jayapura.
               2sg do      thing this quickly because I p l go to Jayapura
               You do this thing quickly because we are going to Jayapura.
     12.19     Yan Sundoi ne       kwop re       wo Edia Yesa ne kem                                   to.
               Yan Sundoi d e t      die p e r f but Edia Yesa d e t live                             still
               Yan Sundoi has already died but Edia Yesa is still living.
     12.20     Ji   ma     it        san       te   ji                     mu.

               I came and put on clothes then I went.
    In all of the above cases none of the clauses preceded by prepositional or compounding
conjunctions can be pre-posed, as this is not possible in Abun. In all of the sentences above
there are no special verb forms used, as the form of the verb in Abun is invariant. Therefore
it could be said that the constituent structure of these sentences is identical. However, this is
not the case.
   In the previous section it was shown that the placement of the final negative particle nde
could indicate that clauses which were linked by means of prepositions such as wa were
subordinate. In example 12.6 earlier, the final interrogative particle e also indicated that
several clauses linked to the main clause by the preposition wa were subordinate. In Abun
the mood particle is always the final constituent of the clause.38 If this same indicator of
subordination is applied to clauses that are linked by ‘compounding’ conjunctions what is the
outcome? Can clauses linked by compounding conjunctions be shown to be embedded just
as those linked by prepositions are? When this test of subordination is applied it can be seen
that sentences which use compounding conjunctions are in fact different to those which make
use of prepositions. Example 12.5 is repeated below as example 12.21 to show this contrast.




38    This is discussed more fully in Chapter 6.
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                                                               209

     12.21     M en yo           ku         oto wa men bes men bi                                       suk           yo    mo         nde.
                I pl    neg      fin d      car    fo r    I pl        lift        I pl    po ss        th in g       neg   e x is t   neg

               We d i d     n o t f i n d a n y c a r s to c a r r y o u r lo a d ( f o r u s ) a t a ll.

   In example 12.21 above, the main clause verb ku ‘get’ is negated and the final negative
particle nde occurs after the embedded clause which is linked by the preposition wa ‘for’. In
example 12.22 below, the means of clause linkage is the compounding conjunction we
‘because’. The negative particles have been placed in exactly the same way as in 12.21 above,
yet this is an unacceptable sentence.
     12.22      *Ji     yo         ma          we                 ji          bi          nggon         i          nde.
                I sg   neg          co m e b ecause            I sg    po s s      w om an     s ic k       neg

               I d id n o t c o m e b e c a u s e m y w if e w a s sic k .

   Example 12.22 above is structurally incorrect because, when clauses are linked by a
compounding conjunction such as we ‘because’, each clause must be individually marked
for negation if negation is relevant. In example 12.23 below only the verb of the first clause,
ma ‘come’, is negated. The second negative particle nde occurs before the conjunction we
indicating that the second clause is not a subordinate clause.
     12.23     Ji      yo                ma nde           wej i        bi          nggon                      i.
               I sg     neg        com e       neg        because             I sg   po ss    w om an        s ic k
               I d id n o t c o m e b e c a u s e m y w if e w a s sic k .

   When clauses are linked by compounding conjunctions they cannot be embedded, as is
the case when clauses are linked by prepositions. In these cases each clause must be marked
for negation and for mood, if this is applicable. Each clause could stand as an independent
clause. Therefore the sentence which uses a compounding conjunction as the means of clause
linkage is structurally different to those which use prepositions. The following examples
indicate the mood and negative marking of clauses linked by these conjunctions.39
     12.24     A    sun      tom we          boge  jon it.
               2sg get.up imp because fish be.cook cam
               Get up, because the fish is cooked!
               Ji       titi       satu           mo        kampung sor                      we      j i yo
               lS G     flee       return         to        village just                     because lS G NEC
               bi     os     wa j i      kem mo Dom nde.
               po ss  way for I s g stay at Dom n e g
               I just fled back to the village because I did not have any way to stay (on) in
               Dom.




39    It could be said that on this basis Abun does possess a subordinate/coordinate distinction of clause
      types. We have preferred not to incorporate this distinction within our analysis because as pointed
      out at the beginning o f Chapter 11 there is little syntactic marking to distinguish the two types.
      Rather we have preferred to distinguish the other syntactic feature that these conjunctions possess,
      namely the ability to compound and create new forms.

              unclean (lit. women make difficulties for them).
     12.27    An         yo       nut-bot               an        bi       siri      nde, wo an mu

              ki-bot              ye            yi          bi    siri.

              He does not think about (the things) he (does ) wrong but he goes (and) talks
              about (the things) other people (do) wrong.
   The third conjunction that is included in the group of compounding conjunctions is the
sequential conjunction te ‘then’. Abun has no single conjunction which in meaning is
precisely equivalent to a coordinate conjunction such as the English ‘and’. However, te and
its dialect variant ge in compound form produce a number of varying sequential
conjunctions. It has been observed (Longacre 1985:267) that the notions of temporal
simultaneity and sequence “are elaborated with considerable range and variety in Papua New
Guinea”. The number of sequential variants found in Abun is typical of a Papuan language
and shows something of the influence of these languages on Abun syntax. It may be
uncommon to group sequential conjunctions together with those conjunctions meaning
‘because’ and ‘but’. However, there are no syntactic distinctions found in Abun complex
sentences which correlate with the semantic differences of these conjunctions and which
would justify a further subdivision. Another type of conjunction, (that which means
‘alternation’, such as the English ‘or’) is also normally considered together with a
conjunction of contrast such as wo ‘but’. Abun has no single morpheme which is used to
indicate alternation.40 Therefore for Abun, on the basis of common syntactic behaviour,
sequential conjunctions are included within the second group of prepositional
conjunctions—the ‘compounding’ conjunctions. Examples of sentences containing te and its
variant ge are given below:
     12.28    M en kem sane               wade jam                        dik bayok, te    men
               I pl        stay like.that until hour                      one perhaps then I pl
              jam kapar-ok uk.
               hear ship-fly make.noise
               We stayed there for about an hour, then we heard the noise of the plane.
     12.29    An maskwa ge       an     gu anbi        nggon                                kam-dik       kam-dik.
              3sg angry    then 3sg beat 3sg poss woman                                     day-one       day-one
              He was angry then he beat his wife every day.
   Given that these examples differ significantly from those normally described as
‘subordinate’ or ‘coordinate’, is a third option available? For example, is it possible to



40    This is a feature marked on each clause which may represent a choice to the hearer. In
      interrogatives bado is used. Otherwise the temporal subordinate conjunction yo is used, or the
      particle ka, a borrowed term from the unrelated Biak language.
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                                                   211

consider these sentences as ‘cosubordinate’ in the same way that Foley and Van Valin apply
this term to various clause types that are found in the clause-chaining languages of Papua
New Guinea and elsewhere? They describe their usage of the term ‘cosubordinate’ in the
following way (Foley & Van Valin 1984:257): “a dependency relation exists between the
juncts in that they must have the same illocutionary force and share the same absolute tense”.
This is not the case for Abun where, as illustrated in example 12.24 above, the imperative
mood is marked only on the first clause and the second clause is marked by an aspect
marker.41 In fact the Abun sentences described here fit more closely Foley and Van Valin’s
definition of coordination, although they (Foley & Van Valin 1984:243) admit that they do
not use this term in the ‘traditional’ sense:
          Coordinate nexus applies to any construction in which the juncts are not in a part-
          whole relationship i.e. one junct is not embedded in the other and both juncts
          may be independently specified for the operators at the given level of juncture.
   Whether Foley and Van Valin’s terminology is used or not it can be seen that these Abun
clauses do not neatly fit the usual labels.

   As stated earlier the most obvious way that this second group of conjunctions differ from
prepositions is in their ability to compound with other conjunctions. By doing so the range of
semantic possibilities is greatly extended. Prepositions generally do not compound in
Abun.42 The following Table 12.3 lists the three ‘base’ conjunctions and the compound
forms that are derived from them. Examples of each compound follow the table.

41       Sentences of the type that Foley and Van Valin describe can in fact be found for Abun but in these
         cases they do not make use of any conjunction. The two clauses are juxtaposed and a mood
         particle after the final clause is understood to apply to both clauses.
42       One exception is su-bere ‘so that’. In this word the preposition su ‘with’ compounds with the tim e
         word here ‘later’ to form a conjunction. Most conjunctions do not compound with tim e words as is
         the case here, the only exception being onde-ber ‘otherwise.will’ which will be discussed later.

(i)   sawe ‘in   case’

   The compound sa-we is derived from sa ‘like’ and we ‘because’. The second clause of
the sentence expresses some undesirable aim or purpose which should be avoided.

(ii) sarewo ‘h o w e v e r ’
    The compound sarewo is made up of sare ‘like.this’ and wo ‘but’. In many instances its
meaning is interchangeable with wo ‘but’. Often it is best translated as ‘however’. While wo
is used to express a semantic relationship of contrast between clauses, sarewo is more likely
to express the semantic relationship of contra-expectation.

                   healed from her sickness.
  The conjunction wo is a constituent of another compound, onde-wo ‘but really’. Since
onde is a negative particle this conjunction will be discussed in the final section of this
chapter on negative conjunctions.


12.4.1    S e q u e n t ia l   clauses


   The compound sequential conjunctions are not only made up of the conjunction te ‘then’
but are also made up of other morphemes. One of these is the adverb or ‘after/finished’. The
other morpheme, the additive conjunction e ‘and’, is the closest to truly being a coordinate
conjunction of any that are found in Abun. Before giving examples of the compound
conjunctions derived from te, a brief sample of Abun sequential clauses is given below
showing the use of these constituent morphemes which frequently feature in Abun sequential
clauses.
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                   213

   Like Papuan languages, Abun has a number of ways to mark temporal simultaneity and
also temporal sequence. In regard to sequence especially, there are quite a variety of options
to express the relationship of temporal succession between clauses. Often clauses that are
sequential in nature do not use any conjunctions at all. They are simply juxtaposed. For
example:
   12.34     M en gwa     bei mone, men git, men ror,         men si     ndar.
             I pl pound sago there I pl      eat I pl   scrape I pl with dogs
             We pounded sago there, we ate, we scraped (the sago palms), we (hunted) with
             dogs.
   On some occasions sequential clauses are joined by e, which could be said to mean ‘and’.
However, it often acts more like a pause word and is never used to join nouns in a coordinate
phrase. In these phrases si ‘with’ is used so that a coordinate phrase such as ‘women and
children’ in Abun is nggon si pa. The conjunction e is used when the speaker is listing items,
or closely related activities, hence it is described as an additive conjunction. In a longer group
of sequential clauses other sequential conjunctions may be used or, conversely, no
conjunctions are used at all.
   12.35     M en gu        boge         e,   men gu      wo-nggwan e,         wo-kwai e ...
             I pl killfish.generic      and I pl kill fish-nggwan and          fish-eel and
             We killed fish of various sorts, we killed nggwan fish, eels...
   12.36     M en titi.    M en sem e men mu sem            kagit suk-sara      ne.
             I plrun.away  I pl sleepand I pl go sleep from NOM-dance that
             We ran off. We slept and we went and slept rather than (continuing on with)
             the dance.
   12.37     Ji      sam mu j i     grem kop e nggwe ne                er.
             I sg carry DIR lSG put         fixed and garden det clear
             I carried (the wood) away, I left it somewhere and the garden was cleared.
   Also frequently used to join sequential clauses is or-e ‘after-and’ or more simply
translated as ‘and’. The addition of or ‘finish/after’ indicates that the action expressed by the
previous clause is finished and so this adds to the sequential nature of the sentence.
   12.38     Nggon w e si       Abaidim kwas o r e go          o r e tik on      ne.
             women two with Abaidim bum and cut.up and pull intestines det
             The two women and Abaidim burned off (the hairs of the skin) and they cut
             (the meat) up and they pulled out the intestines.
  Thus the morphemes e and or are joined with te/ge to create other sequential
conjunctions.
(i) ete ‘and then’
   By far the most commonly used sequential conjunction in any narrative or dialogue is ete
‘and then’. It is more frequently used than both of its constituents, e and te.
   12.39     An taru            wa men ete           men        ma.
             3sg send.message for I pl and.then I pl            came
             He sent a message for us and then we came.

   12.40     A     ben sare        ete       be rus        sa     u       ne?
             2sg do      like.this and.then later family how which qm
             1. You do (things) like this and then how will it be for the family?
             2. If you keep doing things like this then what will the outcome be for the
                family?
(ii) orete/orge ‘after that then’
    Yet another sequential conjunction is created by the addition of the adverb or ‘after/finish’
to the conjunction ete ‘and then’. Orete and its dialect variant orge differ little in meaning to
ete. The addition of or emphasises that the action expressed by the first clause of the
sentence is finished before proceeding to the action of the second clause. The notion of
immediate chronological sequence is made more evident by usage of orete rather than ete.
Like ete, orete is frequently used.
   12.41     An kon su-git         men git mone or-ete        men mu mo Syurur.
             3sg cook NOM-food I pl eat there after-then I pl go to Syurur
             He cooked food, we ate there and then we went to Syurur.
   12.42     Abaidim sem       wade kam or-ete        Abaidim sun.
             Abaidim sleep until day after-then Abaidim get.up
             Abaidim slept until it was day and then Abaidim got up.
   12.43     Ji ma       or-e       ji     grem suk      or-ge      ji      mu    o     re.
             I sg come after-and I sg put         things after-and I sg     go    again perf
             I came and I stored the things and then I went off again.
   By the illustration of the above examples it can be seen that the Abun speaker has a wide
variety of options when wishing to link clauses that are sequential in nature. As well as not
using any conjunction at all, the speaker may choose from five different conjunctions in
order to express the notion of temporal sequence. Therefore in any sentence of a sequential
nature it is possible to find more than one sequential conjunction used.
   12.44     An gwa drom det       pu       or-ete      yenggras Erensi
             3sg beat drum pieceloud.noise after-then elder      Erensi
             gen ete          Erensi sun.
             startle and.then Erensi get.up
             She beat on the drum loudly and then old Erensi was startled and Erensi got
             up.
(iii) eteyo/oreteyo ‘and next/and so’
   There are two more sequential conjunctions in Abun, but these two have the component
of meaning of result or outcome added to that of temporal sequence. The conjunctions ete
and orete, when expanded by the tensed conjunction yo, result in two new conjunctions
meaning ‘and so’, where both the concepts of sequence and logical result are combined in
one form. In this case the addition of yo does not indicate an irrealis or non-past time setting
for the sentence as when yo is normally used. The addition of yo creates a new conjunction
which differs in its range of meaning and usage from other sequential conjunctions. The uses
of oreteyo compared to orete and other sequential conjunctions is shown by the examples
below. Example 12.45 was earlier given as example 12.41.
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                        215

   12.45     An kon su-git,       men git mone or-ete         men mu mo Syurur.
             3 s g cook NOM-food   I pl eat there after-then I pl go to Syurur
             He cooked food, we ate there and then we went to Syurur.
   12.46     An ben suk-ye            oreteyo an        bi      pa kwop.
             3 s g do NOM-difficulty  and.so     3sg    poss    child die
             He stirred up problems and then as a result his child died.
   Example 12.45 describes a series of events which presumably were accomplished in
close chronological sequence. This is normally the case when the conjunctions ete and orete
are used. However, example 12.46 does not describe events that occur in close chronological
sequence. The time sequence between the two clauses concerned is more indefinite. Rather, it
seems that the second clause does not merely follow on chronologically after the first clause,
but follows as a result of the first one. The event expressed by the second clause arises from,
or is due to the events of the first. Other examples below illustrate this:
   12.47     M en      is-bot jip    mu        nim mu                       bur  ware, Isak
             I pl      descend-along ladder go up  go                       down FRUS Isak
             narar      os, eteyo    men muri kom mo bur.
             confused path and.so I pl lost reach to      ground
             We went down along the stairs, we went up and down, but to no avail, Isak
             was confused as to where to go, and then as a result at the bottom of the
             stairwell we were lost.
   12.48     Nan       bi        mben        goto kra       nan      bi     nyanggon   e   ba
             2   s g   p o s s   i n . law    r e l marry   2   sg   poss   sister     and come
             sakanwa          nan ga-re,        eteyo    suk-yo      gat bado?
             a g r e e . meet 2sg a n a - d e t and.next thing-lNDEF stab perhaps
             Your in-law who married your sister went out to meet you and (what
             happened) next, did something spear him perhaps? [The in-law had died.]
             [‘What happened next?’ could also be read as ‘What was the outcome?’]
   Examples 12.47 and 12.48 above show that something more than sequence is involved.
In both of these examples there is some cause-effect relationship involving the two events
that are linked by ete-yo/or-ete-yo. The second event is regarded as being the result or
outcome of the first. Thus eteyo/oreteyo has been translated as ‘and so’ or ‘and then as a
result’ to indicate its difference to other sequential conjunctions.
   Oreteyo can also be used to link a series of clauses which represent a list of steps or
actions in a common process. In these cases, there is a common semantic thread expressed
by the sequence of clauses, which concerns the completion of the process being described.
To understand this better, it can be seen in example 12.45 given earlier that while there is a
semantic thread between the first two clauses, ‘He cooked food, we ate there...’, there is none
between these first two and the final clause, ‘and then (orete) we went to Syurur’. The event
expressed by this final clause did not follow as a direct result of the events of the other two
clauses. A conjunction like orete does not create any logical expectations. A clause such as
‘and then we went to sleep’ could also have followed the first two. This is not the case when
oreteyo is used, as example 12.49 shows below:
216                                                                                CHAPTER 1 2


   12.49     Pa            go     pa        krop      pa        bok jam tu
             young.man     cut.up young.man make.hole young.man insert vine
             mo o r e te y o pa           fa r jam tu nggwa.
             in    and.next young.man tie vine loop
             The young men cut (it) up, they put holes (in it), they put vine through the
             holes and then they tied the vine into loops.
   Oreteyo is used to link the final clause in these sequences indicating that the outcome of
the process has been reached. Oreteyo precedes the clause that expresses the end of a
semantically related chain of events. In this way the behaviour of the conjunction oreteyo is
not unlike that of the final verb of a chain in clause-chaining languages. In such languages the
distinct markings that the verb takes for tense and person indicate that the end of the chain
has been reached. Likewise by the choice of the conjunction oreteyo speakers can indicate
that the end of certain sequences has been reached. Again there is something more than
chronological sequence involved. Examples 12.50 and 12.51 below show oreteyo used in
this way. Here it has been translated ‘and.next’ to distinguish this usage from that in the
earlier examples.
   12.50     Yen    kwa      semda       e,  yen         kwa      suk      ne    mo
             people do.magic semda       and people      do.magic thing    det   at
             worendam, o r e te y o yen    gwat ma.
             worendam and.next people bring dir
             The people did the ritual for the semda spirit and they did rituals for those
             things at the worendam tree and next they brought (the things) back.
   12.51     M en   grem mo      sun,    orete    men      sis     mu     wai    nggon
             I pl   put on       mat     and.then I pl     push    dir    pass   women
             bi     det-i        ne-ya,          o re te y o yen        nai.
             poss   group-own there-distant and.next people took
             We put (the things) on the mat and then we pushed (it) past the woman’s
             group of relatives over there and then they took (it all).


12.4.2 Constituent status of compounding conjunctions
   So far it has been shown that Abun has postpositional conjunctions and prepositions
which function as conjunctions. In regard to the conjunctions under discussion here,
however, it is not always easy to determine which clause they are considered to be a
constituent of. The situation is further complicated when a postpositional conjunction such as
yo is part of the compound conjunction. In regard to two of the compounding conjunctions,
we ‘because’ and wo ‘but’, there is plenty of variation by speakers as to whether they pause
before or after the conjunction. The larger or more complex the conjunction is, the more
difficult it is to determine whether speakers pause before or after the conjunction. Indeed it
seems that there is no obvious or identifiable pattern by which one can place these
conjunctions as being a part of a particular clause. Therefore sentences which contain
compounding conjunctions have the following structure:
                              CLAUSE 1 + CONJUNCTION+ CLAUSE2
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                             217

   All conjunctions in Abun are typically sentence-medial. While many of the clauses
discussed here could be described as neither subordinate nor coordinate, the role of the
conjunction in Abun is to delineate the semantic relationship that exists between the linked
clauses. Therefore if any constituent of these clauses is absent, including the conjunction, it is
no longer possible to have a complex sentence expressing such semantic relationships as
reason or contrast. In this way then the conjoined clauses become interdependent.


12.5    I nfluen ce o f th e national language on A bun com plex sentence structure

   Over recent years a growing number of Abun speakers have become bilingual and speak
the national language, Bahasa Indonesia. However, the number of those who are reasonably
fluent is still small. This means that the influence of Bahasa Indonesia on Abun complex
sentence structure is not yet great. Abun complex sentences differ quite markedly from
Indonesian complex sentences. There are also several conjunctions in Indonesian which have
no Abun counterpart. The most common of these are kalau ‘if’, sebelum ‘before’ and atau
‘or’. Some Abun speakers add these Indonesian words alongside the existing Abun form.
As yet these are not used to replace the Abun forms which represent these concepts.
   The Indonesian language has, in a small way, influenced the structure of the Abun
complex sentence. All Abun conjunctions are sentence-medial so that sentence structure is as
follows (constituency aside):
                                   CLAUSE 1 + CONJUNCTION+ CLAUSE2
   However, there are Indonesian conjunctions which are sentence-initial. These sentences
have the following structure:
                                   CONJUNCTION+ CLAUSE 1 + CLAUSE2
   This pattern has influenced Abun sentence structure in two cases. The first is with the
concessive conjunction kap-re ‘although’. The second is with the logical conjunction sane
‘so’.
(i) kap-re ‘although’
    Kap-re is actually a noun phrase meaning ‘this (period of) time’. Kap ‘time (unspecified)’
is an older word which is infrequently used. It survives as a variant of ‘when
( interrogative ) ’, kap u? ‘when?’. The other variant is kam u? ‘day which/when?’. Kapre
has come to be used as a conjunction meaning ‘although/even though’. Of the existing Abun
conjunctions there is none that has the equivalent meaning of ‘although’.43 Indonesian,
however, is a language which strongly marks the semantic notion of concession. There are a
number of forms which can be used including meskipun ‘although’, walaupun ‘although’
and also sungguhpun and sekalipun. Therefore it appears that the Abun temporal phrase kap-
re has undergone a category change. In doing so, it fills a semantic concept which is strongly
marked in the national language, but was not explicitly marked in Abun.



43     The semantic notion o f concession can be created in Abun by marking the first clause with the
       factitive predicate marker da and linking the two clauses by means o f sarewo ‘how ever’. This gives
       rise to a sentence with the meaning ‘He actually da did X however sarewo Y ‘.
218                                                                                 CHAPTER 1 2


   Not only has the influence of Indonesian created a conjunction out of a temporal phrase,
but also its use in Abun follows the Indonesian sentence pattern. Kapre is a sentence-initial
rather than a sentence-medial conjunction. As such it is the only sentence-initial conjunction
in Abun. It has been suggested (Thompson & Longacre 1985:205) that bilinguals “create
patterns in one of their languages which are structurally parallel to those found in the other”.
This appears to be confirmed by the usage of kapre, which is most common with bilingual
speakers who have been educated in Indonesian. The following examples show the influence
of the Indonesian sentence structure. The first is in Bahasa Indonesia, the others are Abun
examples.
     12.52     Walaupun ia       sakit ia      pergi ke kelas.
               although    3sg ill      3sg go         to class
               Although he was ill he went to class.44
     12.53     Kaprean ben sane men             jim notku      an     to.
               although 3sg do like.that 3sg            love 3sg       still
               Although he does (things) like that we still love him.
     12.54     Kaprean bari-wa                Rahel bi       ai      wergat       an.
               although 3sg not.want-TRS Rahel poss father persuade 3sg
               Even though she did not want (to do it), Rahel’s father persuaded her.
(ii) sane ‘so’
   The conjunction sane ‘so’ has also been influenced by the sentence structure of the
national language. Sa-ne is actually an adverbial meaning ‘like-that’ or ‘in that way’. It is
used as an adverbial in example 12.50 above in the first clause—an ben sane ‘he did (things)
like that’. Like kapre, sane has come to be used as a conjunction. On many occasions sane
may precede a single clause only. In these cases as in example 12.55 below, it acts as an
adverb.
     12.55     Sane an       i      dom.
               so     3sg sick also
               1. So she was sick also.
               2. It was like this, she was sick as well.
   Frequently with this type of sentence sane does not have the connective meaning of ‘so’,
but rather sane is equivalent to a descriptive sentence such as ‘It was like this...’ or ‘It was
this way...’ Abun has neither a lexical equivalent to ‘it’ nor to the copula ‘be’, therefore sane
in clause-initial position can be adequately translated in this manner. The meaning of the
adverbial sane has been extended to include that of a logical link between clauses and even
between larger units such as paragraphs. The influence of Indonesian is such that sane may
be either a sentence-initial or a sentence-medial conjunction. Examples 12.56 and 12.57
below are from illiterate speakers. Here sane is a sentence-medial conjunction following the
usual Abun pattern.
     12.56     Nin mu sino sane nin mewa                   yu.
               2pl go all       so      2 pl look.after refl
               You all go together so you can look after each other.



44    This example is taken from Echols and Shadily (1975:25).
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                 219

   12.57    A   kaim yenggras it, sane a        yo da        nau        o  nde.
            2sg body elder      cam so     2sg neg drink palm.wine again NEG
            You are an old man now, so you don’t drink palm wine any more.
   Examples 12.58 and 12.59 below are from speakers who have been educated in
Indonesian. In these examples sane is a sentence-initial conjunction.
   12.58    Sane men      ben  kw at     pe          sa,           men siker
            so   I pl     make platform secure       when.REAL     I pl tease
            nok        hot kwa       yo       kwa      yo.
            wild.pig   about several det.(i) several det.(i)
            So when we had secured (the pig) to the platform, we teased it about all kinds
            of things.
   12.59    Sane men sam kwem              mu ti           kwop karowa sem nap.
            so   I pl    carry canoe       dir seaward leave near            sea waves
            So we carried the canoe towards the sea (and) left it near the water’s edge.
   Unlike with kapre the influence of Indonesian is not so strong as to totally change sane
from a sentence-medial to sentence-initial conjunction. Nevertheless it can be seen that sane
does not behave like other prepositional conjunctions.
   The conjunction sane has several variants all of which illustrate that the influence of the
Indonesian language is still only partial. Sane, in common with the compounding
conjunctions, also has the ability to compound with other conjunctions, creating new forms.
Sane-yo and sane-ge/te are two variants which could both be translated as ‘so then’ or
‘therefore’. Just as the distinction between yo and sa was primarily one of tense or time
setting, this distinction is carried over to the conjunction sane by means of the compound
forms. Thus sane-ge is ‘therefore-REAL’ and sane-yo ‘therefore-iRR’.
(iii) sane-ge ‘therefore-REAL’
   The compound sane-ge uses the conjunction ge ‘then’ to indicate realis or past time rather
than the subordinating conjunction sa. There are dialect variants sane-te and sane-gede.
Sane-ge differs from sane-yo only in the sense that sane-ge links two clauses that express
events that have already occurred or are already past.
   12.60    An mu mo nggwe sane-ge                men eswa         an     sor     ndendu.
            3sg go to garden therefore-REAL I pl wait.for 3sg only evening
            She had gone to the garden therefore we waited for her until evening.

             I was shaking, I was terrified therefore I did not know what I was saying.
220                                                                                  CHAPTER 1 2


   12.62     Be        yerom k i   do,    ana si        nje    gu       an    bi
             later     yerom say   com    foc with      people kill     3sg   POSS
             yegon           yerom re       e, sane-ge           an    mu re.
             male.relative yerom this and therefore-REAL 3sg go perf
             Later the yerom spirit would say that (the shaman) was the one who together
             with others killed his relative this (other) yerom, so the shaman went away (to
             avoid suspicion).
    In the above example the first clause represents not an actual event but only a possibility.
However this possibility, what the yerom spirit might say, occurred in the past according to
the time setting of the narrative from which this sentence was taken. The last clause of the
sentence is marked with the perfect aspect re. By this it is known that the events described
have already taken place. Therefore these clauses are linked by sane-ge rather than sane-yo
to indicate a past time setting.
(iv) sane-yo ‘therefore-iRR’
    When the temporal conjunction yo is joined to sane, creating sane-yo, then the various
ranges of meaning attributable to yo can be added as well. In Chapter 11 it was stated that yo
is used to indicate future events or plans. It can also be used to describe hypothetical events
and procedural, hypothetical events. Sane-yo is also used to link clauses of this nature.
Examples 12.63 and 12.64 describe future intent and non-past time respectively.
   12.63     Set     bi   ai      mo ket tu           re      sane-yo
             Set     poss father at  west distant     perf   therefore-iRR
             me-ka-we mu kekro.
             lPL-CL-two go quickly
             Set’s father is already over there so we should go quickly.
   12.64     Nan bi     nyanggon          lie i    kam-dik      kam-dik
             2sg possfemale.relative     det  sick day-one      day-one
             sane-yo       yo syesyar       nde.
             therefore.iRR nbg come.out neg
             Your female relative is sick every day therefore she does not come out.
   Example 12.65 below describes a hypothetical situation. Hence sane-yo rather than sane-

  The following examples express events that are considered likely to happen, best
expressed in English by ‘whenever’. Here again sane-yo is the conjunction used.

               touch her.
(v) sane-sa ‘had that been the case’
   These two variants of the conjunction sane, described above, overtly mark the time setting
of the complex sentence by means of the additions of ge or yo. Normally the conjunction ge
does not indicate time setting but rather indicates temporal sequence. It is used in this way
because when the conjunction sa combines with sane the meaning of the compound form is
not that of time setting. Sa has been described as a realis conjunction. This definition has
been taken to mean primarily that sa can be used to indicate events occurring in the past. If
events are marked for past time setting this is an indicator that these events are factual. In
Abun the conjunction sa has a secondary usage that is derived from this ‘factual’ component
of its meaning. This secondary usage can best be described as ‘subjunctive’. The following
examples illustrate this secondary usage which is evident in the compound form sane-sa.
   12.68    A       napawa   amam bi   suk-du     kamekre,
             2 sg   remember daddy POSS NOM-speak yesterday
            sanesa                 kw is  yo   ga a         nde.
            had.that.been.the.case snake neg bite 2sg neg
            1. Had you remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake wouldn’t
              have bitten you.
            2. If you had remembered what Daddy said to you yesterday, the snake would
              not have bitten you.
   The context for example 12.68 above is that a father has warned his son not to play in
long grass, because often snakes are found there. The son ignores the warning and is bitten
by the snake. The semantic thrust of sane-sa is to indicate that had the events of clause one
been factual then the events of clause two would not have happened. Example 12.69 is
similar:
            A       jam     mo   ji   bi      suk-du,       sanesa
            2sg      hear   to    lSG POSS    NOM-speak     had.that.been.the.case
            a      yo    ku suk-ye            sare      nde.
            2sg NEG get NOM-difficult like.this neg
            1. Had you listened to me, you would not have got into this trouble.
            2. If you had listened to me you would not have got into this trouble.
222                                                                                         CHAPTER 12


   By comparing the usage of sane-sa with sane-yo it can be seen that sa and yo
demonstrate a perfective/imperfective contrast. Sane-sa has the meaning ‘had that been the
case’, which is perfective or realis. On the other hand sane-yo can mean ‘that being the case’
which is imperfective or irrealis. Example 12.70 below shows sane-yo used in this way.
      12.70     M en i,          sane-yo             men mu nai pel mo mantri.
                I pl sick that.being.the.case I pl          go take pills at health.worker
                1. If it is the case that we are sick, we go and get pills from the health worker.
                2. Whenever we are sick, we go and get pills from the health worker.
     The last variant of sane is sane anato. This will be discussed in the following section.


12.6 anato ‘causative’ conjunction
    In the previous section two conjunctions were described which primarily filled another
category in Abun grammar besides that of ‘conjunction’. Kap-re is a temporal phrase
meaning ‘this time’. Sane is an adverbial meaning ‘like that’ or ‘in that way’. For both these
forms the influence of the national language has affected the sentence structures in which
they are used as conjunctions. There is one other Abun word -anato- which is used as a
conjunction, but this word is primarily used as another part of speech. Unlike kapre and
sane, this word, anato shows no influence from Indonesian in the way that it is used. Anato
is primarily a noun modifier with the meaning of ‘focus’. It is also used as a conjunction to
link clauses together. Therefore this word fills two categories in Abun grammar. Anato does
not fit into any other type of conjunction described so far, so it is discussed separately to
other conjunctions.
   The word ana-to consists of two morphemes ana ‘focus’ and to ‘nmp’ 45 Anato
frequently modifies a noun phrase to bring this noun phrase into focus, just like a cleft
construction does in languages that are capable of cleft constructions. Since Abun does not
possess a copula the type of cleft constructions found in English are not possible. Neither are
passive constructions possible in Abun. However, the semantic possibilities engendered by
both the passive and cleft constructions are handled in Abun by means of de-focus and focus
respectively. A noun phrase may be brought into focus by means of anato. In this way
anato functions as a noun modifier, as shown in the examples below.
      12.71     Yewon       anato git    suk     ne mori.
                shamans foc         kill thing that afterwards
                1. The shamans were the ones who killed the things afterwards.
                2. It was the shamans who killed the things afterwards.
      12.72     Siri       ne    anato ben           suk-ye          wa j i       to.
                wrong DET FOC              make NOM-difficult for lSG             still
                1. Those sins are still making life hard for me.
                2. It is those sins that are still causing difficulties for me.
   The above examples are grammatically a single clause. In these cases anato always brings
into focus or topicalises the noun that it follows. However, anato plays another role in Abun
grammar. Anato may act as a conjunction to link two clauses together.45



45     The Noun M odifying Particle or NMP to was discussed earlier in Chapter 9 under Relative Clauses.
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                223

   12.73     Ji      ben siri       ne     anato ben       ji ku              suk-i.
             I sg do       wrong det       foc       make lSG get             NOM-sick
             1 .1 did wrong, that is why I get sicknesses.
             2. It is because I did wrong that I get sick.
   Example 12.73 and 12.72 are structurally very similar. In example 12.72 a noun phrase is
modified by anato followed by the verb ben ‘make’. In example 12.73 a whole clause is
‘modified’ by anato which is again followed by the verb ben. It is possible in Abun thinking
that just as a noun phrase may be brought into focus by means of anato a whole clause may
also be brought into focus in the same way. In complex sentences anato together with the
causative verb ben ‘make’ is often used to express a causative relationship between the two
clauses, resulting in an English rendering such as ‘that is why’ or ‘that is the reason’. The
English ‘that’ refers to the entire clause which anato follows.
   In examples such as 12.73 above where the second clause predicate is ben ‘make’ it is
easy to see that the type of focus brought about by the addition of anato is causative.
However, in some complex sentences speakers omit the causative predicate ben. In these
cases anato alone is used to express a causative relationship between the clauses concerned.
For example:
   12.74     Ye mo       nden            maskwa ye            mo    sem      anato
             peopleat     interior       angry  people        at    sea      CAUSE
            be     men ki-bot       yawa      or      we.
            later I pl talk-about appease finish thorough
            The people in the jungle are angry with the people on the coast that is why we
            are going to talk this matter over thoroughly to bring it to an acceptable
            outcome.
   12.75    An     ki     do,   an bi    nggon             bisor                wa an
            3sg    say    com   3sg poss woman             request.sorcery     for 3sg
            anato kam-dik kam-dik an gu              an     bi    nggon bu.
            cause day-one day-one 3sg beat 3sg poss woman always
            He said that his wife had asked people to kill him (by means of sorcery) that is
            why everyday he is always beating his wife.
   It appears that i n most languages, the morpho-syntax does not distinguish between
 cause’ and ‘reason’ adverbial clauses.’ (Givon 1990:834) Yet this distinction is evident in
Abun, anato being ‘cause’ and we indicating ‘reason (because)’. Generally when anato
alone links two sentences its meaning is that the first clause ‘is the reason for’ the second.
   All sentences described above have the structure:
                                     clause 1 + anato +   CLAUSE2
   Structurally, then, these sentences are similar to those which use compounding
conjunctions.
(vi) sane anato ‘so th at is the reason’
  Abun speakers frequently use anato together with sane. These two conjunctions in
combination result in a greater emphasis of the causative relationship that exists between the
224                                                                                  CHAPTER 1 2


two linked clauses. By using sane anato speakers are strongly emphasising that the event
expressed in the first clause is the reason for the event expressed in the second clause.
   12.76     Regina ben siri          su       nje      sane    anato   ndamso     gu
             Regina do wrong          with     people   so      cause   ghost      harm
             an    bi      pa      kwop.
             3sg poss child die
             Regina committed adultery with various people so that is why the ghost (of her
             husband) killed his child.


12.7 N egative conjunctions
   The final group of Abun conjunctions all contain the negative particle onde. When a single
clause is negated in Abun it is negated by means of two particles which bracket the verb
phrase. So clause negation has the structure:
                               subject+ yo    + verb phrase+ nde
   But there is another type of negation in Abun which occurs on the level of the complex
sentence. Within a complex sentence whatever is expressed by the first clause can be negated
by means of onde. Onde always occurs together with some other conjunction. These create a
group of conjunctions which are termed ‘negative’ conjunctions. Sentences that use these
negative conjunctions have the following structure:
                           CLAUSE   1+   C/Rfc-CONJUNCTION + CLAUSE 2

   Semantically this is most basically expressed as ‘not clause one, clause two’. It has been
claimed earlier in this chapter that Abun complex sentences show much influence from
Papuan languages. It is interesting to note that Barai, an unrelated Papuan language, also has
two distinct means of negation. In the words of Foley and Van Valin (1984:192), one of
these “ba...negates the entire clause and roughly means ‘it is not the case that’...it is the only
element that ever follows the verb in heavily verb-final Barai”. The fact that this form has an
equivalent meaning to the Abun onde is another factor which confirms the influence of
Papuan languages on Abun syntax.
   Table 12.4 below lists all the negative conjunctions. Fuller explanations and examples of
each are given afterwards.
                               TABLE 12.4: NEGATIVE CONJUNCTIONS

(i) onde-wo ‘but really’
   The negative meaning of onde can be clearly understood when it is part of the contrastive
conjunction onde-wo. Any clauses linked by onde need to be understood semantically in the
following way:
       clause  1                       onde-                            clause   2
       event asserted                  not the case, instead            real/altemativeevent
The event expressed by clause one is stated positively; it is not marked as negative within the
clause by means of the negative particles yo and nde. However, whatever was asserted by
clause one is not the case, and so this clause is negated by means of onde. Therefore the
event expressed by clause two is, in the speaker’s opinion, the real situation. If the clause is
linked by a negative conjunction other than ondewo, the event expressed by clause two
indicates an alternative situation to that expressed in clause one. Thus ondewo links clauses
expressing a false and true contrast. For example:
   12.77     Yenggras    njim     do re   ndar       syut         nok ondewo
             elders      think   com here dogs       bark.at wild.pig but.really
             ndar syut     pa       kaiyi.
             dogs bark.at child actual
             The old men thought that the dogs were barking at a wild pig but actually the
             dogs were barking at a child.
   12.78     An     ki  do       Sem ana      ben  brek        ne      ges ondewo
             3sg    say com      Sem foc      make plate       let     fall but.really
             an    dakai ben      ges.
             3sg self        make fall
             He said that Sem was the one who made the plate fall but really he himself
             caused (it) to fall.
(ii) onde-sa ‘otherwise (would)’
   Onde-sa is made up of the sentence negator onde and the realis or past time conjunction
sa. The combined meaning of the two creates a conjunction that is counterfactual. Again the
structure of the sentence using onde-sa is broken down semantically below to explain clearly
the meaning of these types of sentences.
       clause  1                  onde-sa                            CLAUSE 2
       event asserted             (if) not so, instead               different outcome, past
   The event expressed by clause one is given in the indicative. These events may or may not
be true. The second clause describes a situation that would arise in the event that clause one
was negated. Onde represents the negation. Sa indicates a past time setting to both the event
and the outcome described. In this type of sentence both the event and the outcome may refer
to hypothetical situations. Even so, sa indicates that whether hypothetical or not the events in
question would have occurred at some time in the past, rather than in the future. In these
sentences onde links clauses in a counterfactual manner giving the meaning: ‘If the events
expressed by clause one had not happened then the events expressed by clause two would
have’. Since Abun has no English equivalent to the conditional ‘i f , this meaning is merely
for the purposes of good translation. However “Counter-fact propositions need not be
226                                                                                 CHAPTER 1 2


associated with conditional adv clauses.” (Givon 1990:831), as is the case here. That is to
say, a counterfactual proposition does not need to be marked by overt conditional means
only. A language may use other means to indicate this. For example:
   12.79    Su-gane      men ku   Ron onde-sa,               men yo        ku sugum
            with-that   I pl meet Ron otherwise-REAL         I pl neg      get money
             wa men ma            nde.
             for I pl come neg
             1. At that time we met Ron, otherwise we would not have had money to come
                (here).
             2. If, at that time, we hadn’t met Ron we would not have had money to come
               here.
   In the sentence above clause one expresses a factual situation which did actually
occur—the participants met a man who gave them money. Clause two expresses a
hypothetical situation which would have arisen if they had not received the money—they
would not have been able to pay for fares to return to their village. The usage of sa indicates
to hearers that this speculation is about past events. Example 12.80 below is similar. It
contains the variant onde-sor-sa. This adds a component of meaning similar to ‘it was just as
well that...’
   12.80     Nu-won       ga mo Aiwom ndo, ndo sato          yew on yo gu
             house-shaman rel at Aiwom good good for.example shamans NEC kill
             yu        o    nde, wo onde-sor-sa               be yen     gu     yu  to.
             reel      again       neg     but otherwise-just-REAL later people    kill   refl still
             1. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
               in that the shamans didn’t kill each other any more. But otherwise they would
                still be killing each other.
             2. It was good that they set up a shaman training school at Aiwom. It was good
                  in that the shamans didn’t kill each other any more. But if not they would
                  still be killing each other.
   In the preceding two examples the meaning component that sa adds to these clauses is
that of its primary meaning—it is functioning as a tensed conjunction indicating past time.
The following example differs from 12.79 and 12.80 above in that here sa is functioning
according to its secondary usage—it adds the notion of ‘subjunctive’ to the first clause. Abun
has no lexical equivalent to the subjunctive ‘should’. Therefore the translation of 12.81 below
indicates this.
   12.81     Nin    mbros kwem       ne     sino, onde-sa               pa
             2pl    row   canoe      det    all   otherwise-REAL        young.man

             strong.wind big 3sg do           how which CM
             You should have all rowed that canoe, otherwise if one of you rowed alone and
             then there was a really violent wind, then what would he have done?
   Example 12.81 above is a reprimand by an older woman to certain young people. As
such it could also be translated as ‘Would that you had all rowed that canoe’. This also is
PREPOSITIONAL AND COMPOUNDING CONJUNCTIONS                                                           227

subjunctive. It expresses a wish or desire that past events could have occurred in a better
way.46 As such this clause refers to a hypothetical past event. What actually happened in this
case was that one young man was left to row the canoe alone against a strong wind.’
    Because Abun has no morpheme to represent a hypothetical situation such as the English
‘i f , it is only by context and knowledge of the events described that hearers encode what is
hypothetical and what is fact. The function of onde is to negate the contents of the preceding
clause. On its own it does not attach truth value to these clauses. Therefore when onde is part
of the conjunction onde-wo, it is used to express the semantic notion of ‘contrary to
expectation’. When part of the conjunctions onde-sa and onde-yo, onde is used to express
the notion of ‘contrary to fact’.
(iii) onde-yo ‘otherwise (will)’
   Onde-yo differs in meaning from onde-sa in the matter of time setting only. In clauses
linked by onde-sa, the ‘tensed’ conjunction sa indicates to hearers that the time setting of the
sentence and its contents are in the past, events described therein have already occurred.
However, when the conjunction changes to yo, hearers understand that the event expressed
by the second clause is non-past. These events have not actually occurred and may be
hypothetical in nature also.

               yo git kukis         o       nde.
               NEG eat biscuits again neg
               1. You sweep up that mess down there, otherwise you will not get any more
                  biscuits!
               2. If you do not sweep up that mess down there, you will not get any more
                  biscuits!
  Givon (1990:831) makes the following comments about counterfactual conditionals
which are relevant to this discussion of negative conjunctions.
       In addition to the subordinators that (may) mark them, counterfact clauses tend
       to be marked, cross-linguistically, by a combination of two semantically
       conflicting verbal inflections:
       (a) A prototypical realis operator, such as past, perfective or perfect', and,
       (b) A prototypical irrealis operator, such as: future, subjunctive, conditional
           or a modal.
   According to Givon this ‘semantic conflict’ arises if a clause is marked with both a realis
and irrealis ‘operator’ or one clause may be marked realis and the other irrealis. This situation
may arise as given in example 12.83 below. The first clause is marked by the perfect aspect
marker re. However, the usage of onde-yo in sentences is very similar to the usage of the




46    Just as Abun has no word for the modal ‘should’ neither does it have an equivalent to the
      subjunctive verb ‘w ish’. The subjunctive usage of sa is the nearest Abun equivalent for expressing
      this notion.
228                                                                                  CHAPTER 1 2


conjunction yo on its own. If a sentence describes a predictive or procedural situation, then
onde-yo is used.
   12.83     Yen       gu     or           re,    onde-yo         ye        si      ma
             people    kill   completely   perf   otherwise-iRR   people    go.with come
             mo nu         de, yen        bi    ri              nai.
             to house side people give ginger.root IO
             They would kill off (all those people). If this is not possible the (young) people
             with them (the older shamans) will come to the side of the house (and) give
             ginger root to (the people they want to kill).
   Onde should not be understood as a negative conditional such as the English ‘unless’. It is
possible to give an alternative translation for example 12.83 above as ‘Unless you sweep up
that mess down there, you won’t get any biscuits!’ However, as seen in examples 12.77 and
12.78 above, which use onde-wo, onde does not always have the meaning of a negative
conditional. When used as part of onde-wo it has the meaning of negative contrast. Usage of
onde indicates some kind of semantic contrast between the propositions involved. This is
achieved by negation of the content of the first clause.
(iv) onde-bere ‘otherwise.CERT’
   This conjunction differs from the others by the addition of the time word here
‘FUTURE/later’. There are several variants of here which need to be explained. These three
variants concern the differences in the way Abun speakers view future time. These variants
are:
                       ber      soon, shortly
                       bere    later, definitely—»will
                       be      later, likely/probably—>could

    All these variants could be translated as ‘later’ or ‘will’ in regards to future time. Ber is
used to indicate that the future time specified is in the near future. However, with bere and
be the matter of future time proximity is unspecified. What is specified is the degree of
certainty that the speaker attaches to the future event described. Hence, if the speaker feels
that the event is a certainty then bere is used, meaning ‘definitely will’. If the speaker
attaches less certainty to the future event taking place then be is used, meaning ‘probably
will’ or ‘could’. Both these time words can be joined to onde to create counterfactual
conjunctions. These conjunctions link events that are non-past or future time in the same way
as the conjunction onde-yo. By choosing onde-bere or onde-be rather than onde-yo the
speaker adds the semantic element of ‘degree of certainty’ which is not present in the case of
onde-yo. In regard to counterfactuals Givon (1990:832) notes that “many languages allow
further gradation, most particularly of events/states that are judged to be unlikely but not
altogether impossible”. The gradations referred to here are from possibly true to not true.
The gradation expressed in Abun is in the other direction, from probable to certain. Abun has
no adverb or modal form which means ‘definitely’ or ‘certainly’. Thus these concepts have
been incorporated into these future time words. Examples showing the use of onde-bere and
onde-be are given below:

             1. You go and get it otherwise I could beat you!
             2. If you don’t go and get it I could beat you!
(v) onde-ge ‘otherwise-then’
   This final counterfactual conjunction does not indicate time setting of the clauses involved.
The conjunction ge ‘then’ is joined to onde to indicate sequence of events. It is not as
frequently used as the other counterfactuals. The example below has several variant
translations since the negative contrast indicated by onde can be rendered in several ways in
English.
   12.87     Nggon ne, an ben siri  su sane                         here yen         gu     an

             then people thrust.into spear at
             1. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kill
               her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), otherwise then they will bring her to the
                shaman-house and then spear her (to death).
             2. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kill
                her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), failing that then they will bring her to the
                shaman-house.
             3. That woman, (that) he had committed adultery with, like that, they will kill
                her with sorcery (lit. ginger root), if this is not possible then they will bring
                her to the shaman-house.
  This concludes the discussion of negative conjunctions and it concludes the discussion of
Abun conjunctions covered in this work.
