	abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained much attention for
		representing and analyzing human language computationally. It has spread its
		applications in various fields such as machine translation, email spam
		detection, information extraction, summarization, medical, and question
		answering etc. In this paper, we first distinguish four phases by discussing
		different levels of NLP and components of Natural Language Generation
		followed by presenting the history and evolution of NLP. We then discuss in
		detail the state of the art presenting the various applications of NLP,
		current trends, and challenges. Finally, we present a discussion on some
		available datasets, models, and evaluation metrics in NLP.},
